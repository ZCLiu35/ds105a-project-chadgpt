## 📋General Outline
### 📖Part 1 
- We started off with r/recipe, where we used reddit api to get the data that we wanted (title of post, date and time created, number of upvotes, upvote ratio, number of comments, url)
- Cleaned the data (such as filtering out non english...changing data type...)


### Part 1 📊Analysis
We analysed data from reddit and observed some trend on posts with different flairs!

    - Remarkably, within the top 10% of posts ranked by upvote ratio, those labeled with the "dessert" flair exhibit the highest frequency. Notably, this occurrence surpasses the second-highest, "poultry," by more than half. It suggests a strong inclination among Reddit users towards favoring dessert-related posts.
