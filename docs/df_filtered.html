      <td># Crispy Jumbo Potato Chips \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 6 Fresh Russets all the same size (150g)\n* 4 Liters Canola oil for deep frying\n* 2 tsp Lye Water (Koon Chun brand)\n* Coarse Salt\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Peel and keep in cold water. \n2. Cut into thirds longways (3 thick slices).\n3. Cut the 2 side slices in half and the center one in thirds.\n4. Rinse and store in water until ready to move on. \n5. Add 2 liters of water and 2 tsp lye water to a large pot.\n6. Bring the water to boil and add potatoes. \n7. Start a timer when the water returns to a boil. \n8. Reduce heat to a soft boil and cook for exactly 7 minutes.\n9. Quickly and very gently ladle chips in to an ice bath. Dry on a rack.\n10. Preheat deep oil to 170C/340F\n11. Fry in batches until color just starts to change.\n12. Drain and cool on a rack.\n13. Transfer rack to the freezer overnight.\n14. Preheat deep oil to 190C/375F\n15. Fry in small batches until golden and crispy.\n\nTip: Fresh potatoes is key. They should be very firm and no sprouting eyes. Russets are the best around these parts but other high starch varieties should work.\n\nTip: The water is a very weak lye solution but you should be careful. No splashing and gloves/eye wear is not overkill.\n\nTip: The lye water helps break down the edges resulting in crispy edges. Baking soda should work but I find the taste a little harsher.\n\nTip: The square center chip tends to break so add them in the water late. There's six of them and can be used elsewhere. \n\nTip: Don't let the ice crystals melt. They cause the chaos for the extra crispy edges. You want super cold into super hot.\n\nTip: After the first fry these will keep in the freezer for a while. Just try not to damage the edges.</td>

      <td>Thai Green Curry Chicken Satay</td>

      <td>You could use any curry paste you like. Do you have a favourite shop-bought paste or a homemade Panang curry paste in the freezer? Feel free to use that one. Making use of a curry paste for a marinade is a real shortcut to a flavor-packed BBQ-dish!  \nFull recipe: https://www.misterspiceguy.com/recipes/thai-green-curry-chicken-satay\n\n**Ingredients for chicken satay:**\n\n* 3 tbsp homemade green curry paste (or any other curry paste)\n* 1 tbsp vegetable oil\n* 500g chicken fillet or thighs, cut into thin strips\n* 1 tbsp palm sugar\n* 1 tbsp fish sauce (nam pla)\n* 150 ml coconut milk\n* 2 tbsp lime juice‚Äç\n\n**Ingredients for satay sauce:**\n\n* 1 heaped tbsp of green curry paste\n* 1 tbsp of vegetable oil\n* 2 tbsp of peanut butter (preferably crunchy)\n* 4 tbsp of roasted peanuts, coarsely ground/chopped\n* 150 ml coconut milk\n* 1 tsp fish sauce\n* 1 tbsp palm/regular sugar\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. ‚ÄçThe first step will be cutting up your chicken thighs in chunks of your preference. I personally like to make the cubes approximately 1cm x 1cm, because I don't like to grill the satay for to long. Most important is that you are consistent in the cutting size, so that your satay will cook evenly. Then put all the other satay ingredients in a bowl and give a whisk, add your chicken and put in the fridge for at least one hour but ideally overnight. If you are using wooden skewers, make sure you soak them in water to prevent burning on the BBQ.\n2. ‚ÄçNow it's time to make the peanut-satay sauce. Start by heating up the vegetable oil in a small saucepan on a medium heat. Fry your curry paste for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. Then add all the other sauce ingredients and make sure you put it on your smallest burner on a real low heat. slowly simmer the sauce for about 5 minutes and your satay sauce will be finished. If you cook your satay sauce too long or on a high heat you will see that al the oil from the peanuts and the coconut milk separate and start floating on top, that is not what we are aiming for!\n3. ‚ÄçSkew your chicken satay on the soaked skewers and now it's time to grill the satay. Ideally we do this on a BBQ but sometimes you want to make this dish in winter or you don't want to start a fire. In this case you can also use a griddle pan. Grill your satays on a medium-high heat and make sure you keep turning them often. After about 5 minutes of grilling (depending on your chunk size) your chicken satay will be ready to eat. Serve with the peanut sauce. Enjoy!</td>

      <td>A French side dish that goes well with anything. Simple ingredients but lots of steps. Best suited for special occasions.\n\n[Pictorial on Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/rFIvP9c)\n\n# Potato Pav√©\n\n**Ingredients**\n\nPotato Prep\n\n* 3 large one pound (450g) potatoes.\n* 1 pint heavy cream\n* 1 cup ghee or melted butter\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nInfused Oil\n\n* 2 tbsp duck fat or ghee\n* 1 tsp fresh garlic\n* 1 tsp fresh rosemary\n* 1 tsp fresh thyme\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. These are large baking russets. The bigger the better.\n2. Using a mandolin set to 1mm, square each one long ways. Keep the slices for long chips.\n3. Square the ends of each one. You want all 3 blocks to be the same best you can. Keep the slices for round chips.\n4. Slice the potato block into enough cream to cover.\n5. Line a loaf pan with buttered parchment paper and stack the slices with ghee in between.\n6. Add a little salt and pepper as you go if you want. I do not.\n7. Wrap the paper over and bake in a preheated oven at 350F/175C for 2 hours.\n8. Cover with a cut piece of cardboard wrapped in foil and press until completely cooled with heavy cans.\n9. Remove the weight and chill overnight.\n10. Make the infused oil by heating oil to medium, turning off the heat and adding the garlic/thyme/rosemary. You can do this same day but I made mine day before.\n11. Next day,  remove from pan and cut into even blocks.\n12. Preheat a nonstick skillet to 400F/200C (medium high) and add a teaspoon of the garlic/thyme/rosemary infused ghee or Duck fat.\n13. Fry at least 2 sides until very golden. I like all sides.\n14. Garnish with shaved garlic, chives and rosemary. Serve hot or room temp.</td>

      <td>Yield: 8 medium pretzels\n\nSee how I made them [here](https://youtu.be/kGRa5XLGNAU).\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 175ml warm water\n* 175ml warm milk\n* 1 tsp sugar\n* 7g active dry yeast\n* 2 tsp salt\n* 550g all purpose flour\n* 50g unsalted butter, melted\n* vegetable oil (for oiling bowl)\n* 2lt/10 cups of water\n* 130g baking soda\n* 15g of melted butter and 30g coarse salt for topping\n\n\n\n**Method:**\n\n1. In a small bowl, mix the milk, water, sugar, and yeast and allow the yeast to activate for 5-7 minutes.\n2. In a large bowl, add the flour and make a well in the center.\n3. Sprinkle the salt on the outer edge of the flour, and pour the activated yeast mixture into the well.\n4. Mix the flour with the yeast mixture, add the butter and mix until the mixture is crumbly.\n5. Turn out the dough onto a prep surface, and knead until the dough is elastic (approx. 10-15 minutes). The dough can also be kneaded on low in a stand mixer for 5-10 min).\n6. Let the dough rise in an oiled bowl for one hour.\n7. When the dough is ready, turn out the dough onto prep surface and divide into 8 equal pieces.\n8. Roll each piece into a rope about 24‚Äù/60cm long. To shape, make a u-shape and twist the ends together, then bring the ends to the bottom of the u-shape and press.\n9. In a pot, bring the water to a boil  with the baking soda. Preheat the oven to 230¬∫C/450¬∫F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\n10. Once the water is boiling, drop each pretzel, one at a time, into the pan and leave it for 30 seconds. Scoop the pretzel out with a slotted spoon and place it on the baking sheet.\n11. Once all of the pretzels have gone through the water bath, bake for 12-14 minutes.\n12. Once baked, cool on a rack for about 5 minutes.\n13. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with coarse salt before serving.</td>
