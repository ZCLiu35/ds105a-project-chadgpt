      <td>**Recipe here originally:** [**Buffalo Chicken Tenders**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/buffalo-chicken-tenders/)\n\nI use Frank's, but you can use your favorite cayenne-based hot sauce, or like my dad...you can make a little wing sauce concoction of all your favorite random hot sauces in your fridge.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1¼  pounds chicken tenderloins\n* ½ cup flour\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* 2 eggs\n* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons Frank’s RedHot Original Hot Sauce, or use your favorite cayenne-based hot sauce\n* 2 cups panko\n* 4 scallions, trimmed and minced\n* Neutral oil, for frying\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Prepare the chicken:**\n\n1. Pat the chicken tenderloins dry and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Set up your dredging station:**\n\n1. Set out three shallow dishes. To the first dish, add flour, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and a pinch of salt. To the second dish, add 2 eggs plus 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and whisk until smooth. Add panko with a pinch of salt and pepper to the third dish.\n\n**Preheat the oil:**\n\n1. Add about ¼ inch of neutral oil to a wide pot or skillet. You only need enough oil to come up to half the thickness of a chicken tender. Turn the heat to medium-low to preheat the oil.\n\n**Dredge the chicken:**\n\n1. Dip a chicken tenderloin into the flour and shake off the excess. Next, dip it into the egg mixture and shake off the excess. Finish dredging the chicken by rolling it gently in the panko; gently press it into the tender to ensure it adheres. Transfer to a baking rack. Continue until all tenders are dredged.\n\n**Heat the sauce:**\n\n1. Simmer the remaining 1 cup of hot sauce over low heat as you fry the chicken tenders.\n\n**Fry the chicken tenders:**\n\n1. Turn the heat on the oil to medium. If you drop a piece of panko into the pot, it should bubble and sizzle but not overly vigorously. You can use a meat thermometer to ensure it is 350ºF.\n2. Once the oil is hot, fry the chicken tenders in batches, about 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown. Once the tenders reach 165ºF, transfer them to a cooling rack or paper towel-lined plate.\n\n**Sauce the tenders:**\n\n1. Once all the chicken tenders are fried, pour the warm sauce into a large bowl.\n2. Add the chicken tenders to the bowl in batches and toss gently to coat in the sauce.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Transfer the sauced tenders to a serving platter and sprinkle with minced scallions. Enjoy!</td>

      <td># Homemade Cinnamon Rolls\n\nFor full recipe, tips, &amp;amp; tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/](https://maplewoodroad.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/)\n\n**INGREDIENTS**  \n***Cinnamon Roll Dough***\n\n* 1 cup warm milk (not hot)\n* 2-½ teaspoons instant yeast\n* ½ cup granulated sugar\n* 2 large eggs, at room temperature\n* ¼ cup butter, melted\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 4 cups all purpose flour\n\n***Filling***\n\n* ¾ cup light brown sugar, packed\n* 2 tablespoons cinnamon\n* ½ cup butter, softened\n\n***Icing***\n\n* 6 ounces cream cheese, softened\n* 1-½ cups powdered sugar\n* ⅓ cup butter, melted\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  \n\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**  \n***Making the Dough***\n\n1. Place warm milk in a mixing bowl, add yeast, and give it a stir. Let it sit for a minute or two while you’re gathering your other ingredients. \n2. Next, add sugar, eggs, butter, salt, and vanilla, and mix well. Lastly, using a dough hook, add flour and mix until it forms a firm yet tacky dough that pulls away from the edges. Resist adding more flour…the dough should be slightly tacky.\n3. Remove dough from the mixer and knead by hand, on a lightly floured surface, for 5 minutes (yes, even if you used a stand mixer).\n\n***First Rising***\n\n1. Grease a large bowl with butter or cooking spray. Place the dough in this bowl, cover with a warm towel, and let sit in a warm spot for 1 to 1-½ hours or until it doubles in size.\n\n***Cinnamon Roll Filling***\n\n1. In a bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until it resembles a paste.\n\n***Rolling out the dough, adding filling, and cutting into shape***\n\n1. For this step, I used silicone baking mats, but you can also roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring approximately 22” x 14”.\n2. Drop some of the cinnamon roll filling here and there over the rolled out dough. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently spread the filling all over the dough, keeping away from the edges by about a quarter inch.\n3. Starting at a short end (one of the 14” ends), gently but tightly roll the dough into one long roll.\n4. Using a sharp knife (I found that a serrated knife worked best), cut the roll into 12 evenly sliced pieces. \n\n***Second Rising***\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350℉.\n2. Place the cut cinnamon rolls into a parchment-lined baking dish, three rows of four.\n3. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes, or until they’ve nearly doubled in size.\n\n***Baking Cinnamon Rolls***\n\n1. Remove the plastic wrap and place baking pan in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 20 – 30 minutes. My cinnamon rolls took 30 minutes to bake, but you should start checking on them after 20 minutes. All ovens are different. The cinnamon rolls will be done when the tops have just lightly browned and the dough sounds hollow when you lightly tap on it with a spoon. The rolls will rise even more while they’re baking and will most likely touch each other. This is fine and good…they’ll stay soft in the middle.\n\n***Icing for Cinnamon Rolls***\n\n1. While the rolls are baking, make the icing. Using either a stand mixer or handheld mixer, blend together cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla until smooth. \n2. When the cinnamon rolls are done baking, let them cool about 5 minutes and add icing to the tops, so it will slightly melt and ooze between the swirls. If you prefer the icing thicker on top, wait until they’ve fully cooled.</td>

Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl. Pour 1 cup boiling water over the mushrooms and soak for 20 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the water and finely chop them. Reserve the soaking liquid for the risotto.\n\n**Fry the cremini mushrooms:**\n\n1. Place a large pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium. Add the sliced cremini mushrooms to the dry pot and cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes. The mushrooms will release water and begin to dry out.\n2. Once all the liquid evaporates from the pot, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 8–10 minutes more, turning regularly, until browned and crisp. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Cook the leek:**\n\n1. Add the leek and chopped porcini mushrooms to the pot. Cook, turning occasionally, for 5 minutes until the leek softens.\n\n**Toast the rice:**\n\n1. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot. Add the rice and cook for 2–3 minutes until it begins to toast. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Begin adding liquid:**\n\n1. Add the porcini soaking liquid and stir to incorporate and lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring periodically until the rice absorbs all the liquid.\n2. Add warm water or vegetable stock in ladleful increments, stirring after each addition and adding more liquid once the rice absorbs what’s in the pot. Stir occasionally, but not constantly. You may need to adjust the heat between medium and medium-low to prevent the risotto from sticking.\n3. After 20–25 minutes, the rice should be tender and the liquid creamy. You may need 4–5 cups of liquid, give or take. Taste and add more salt and pepper.\n\n**Finish the risotto:**\n\n1. Turn the heat to low. Add the Taleggio cheese and stir to incorporate. Continue stirring until the cheese melts completely. Add the Parmesan cheese, minced parsley, and lemon juice. Simmer for 2–3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Taste and season, and let the risotto stand for 5 minutes.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the risotto into a large serving bowl. Garnish with sweet pea tendrils and a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese if you like. Enjoy!</td>
