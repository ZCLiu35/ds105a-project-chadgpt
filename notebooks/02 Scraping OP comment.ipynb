      "2. **Preparing Mushrooms:** Place dried wild mushrooms in a glass jug or a small pot. Pour boiling water over them to cover. After 15 minutes, when they are soft, remove and chop them. Reserve the mushroom water for later use, being careful to avoid any sand at the bottom.\n",
      "3. **Frying Onions and Mushrooms:** In a frying pan over medium heat, fry onions until they soften but do not brown, about 5 minutes.

      "6. **Rolling Krokiety:** Spread about 2 tablespoons of filling inside each pancake. Fold the left and right sides inward, then roll up the pancake.\n",
      "7. **Coating Krokiety:** Whisk 2 eggs in a bowl. Dip each krokiet in the egg, then coat with breadcrumbs. Prepared krokiety can be refrigerated for up to three days before frying if needed.\n",

You also may have to make slight adjustments to the heat on your stove to get it to the correct temperature.\n",
      "2. Once your mixture has reached the hard-crack stage (300â„‰ on a candy thermometer), remove the pot from the heat and immediately stir in the baking soda and vanilla extract. Be aware that it will bubble and foam up quite a bit as soon as you add the baking soda, so be ready!\n",

      "**Soup:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n",
      "* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n",
      "* 4 carrots, peeled and diced\n",
      "* 4 ribs celery, trimmed and diced\n",
      "* 1 fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced\n",
      "* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n",
      "* 5 sprigs thyme, bundled together with kitchen twine\n",
      "* 6-7 cups prepared stock from above or use chicken broth\n",
      "* 4 cups chopped or shredded leftover turkey; use in addition to any meat you pull off the turkey carcass\n",
      "* Â¾ cup pastina or ditalini\n",
      "* 1 lemon, juiced\n",
      "* Â½ cup fresh parsley, minced\n",
      "* Big pinch of fennel fronds, minced\n",
      "* Crushed red pepper to taste\n",
      "* Salt and pepper\n",

      "**Make the stock:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Place the turkey carcass in a large stockpot and cover with 12 cups water. You may need more depending on the size of the carcass. Try your best to immerse the bird with water, but if your pot isnâ€™t big enough, itâ€™s ok if the back bone sticks out a bit. Add a big pinch of salt to the water.\n",
      "2. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 2-3 hours. You may wish to flip the bird once during simmering. The liquid should reduce by almost half.\n",
      "3. Cover the pot (with foil, if the turkey is sticking out) and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.\n",
      "4. The next day, remove the carcass from the stock. Pick off any remaining meat and set it aside in a bowl to be added to the soup. Discard the carcass.\n",
      "5. If the stock is very gelatinous, place it on the heat over medium-high just until the gelatin melts, and the stock returns to a liquid. Turn off the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve.\n",
      "6. Give the pot a quick rinse and wipe it out. Return it to the stovetop.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cook the soup aromatics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for 8-10 minutes.\n",
      "2. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the bundle of thyme.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Simmer the soup:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Pour in the prepared stock and the chopped turkey. Add salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove and discard the thyme.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Finish the soup:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Return the soup to a boil. Add the pastina and cook for 3-4 minutes. Taste and add salt and pepper.\n",
      "2. Finish the soup by adding parsley, fennel fronds, and lemon juice.\n",
      "\n",
      "**To serve:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with lemon wedges and minced parsley on the side. Enjoy!\n"
