      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cooking Sauerkraut:** Place sauerkraut with the juice in a pot and add enough water to cover it. Include bay leaves and allspice berries. Simmer on low heat until softened, approximately 3-4 hours. Add more liquid as necessary to keep the sauerkraut submerged.\n",
      "2. **Preparing Mushrooms:** Place dried wild mushrooms in a glass jug or a small pot. Pour boiling water over them to cover. After 15 minutes, when they are soft, remove and chop them. Reserve the mushroom water for later use, being careful to avoid any sand at the bottom.\n",
      "3. **Frying Onions and Mushrooms:** In a frying pan over medium heat, fry onions until they soften but do not brown, about 5 minutes. Then add sliced white mushrooms, increase the heat, and cook until the mushrooms start to brown. Season with Vegeta and black pepper to taste, then remove from the stove.\n",
      "4. **Making Pancakes:** Blend all pancake ingredients until a smooth batter forms. Cook pancakes on a medium-sized non-stick frying pan. Pour a small amount of batter into the hot, oiled pan and spread it around by swirling. Once the pancake is set, remove it and place it on a plate. Repeat until all pancakes are made.\n",
      "5. **Combining Filling Ingredients:** Once the cabbage is cooked, strain it from the liquid and remove the spices. Let it cool enough to handle, then chop finely. Mix with both the re-hydrated and fried mushrooms and onions. Season with sugar, black pepper, and salt to taste.\n",
      "6. **Rolling Krokiety:** Spread about 2 tablespoons of filling inside each pancake. Fold the left and right sides inward, then roll up the pancake.\n",
      "7. **Coating Krokiety:** Whisk 2 eggs in a bowl. Dip each krokiet in the egg, then coat with breadcrumbs. Prepared krokiety can be refrigerated for up to three days before frying if needed.\n",
      "8. **Preparing for Frying:** Spread about 2 tablespoons of filling inside each pancake. Fold the left and right sides inward, then roll up the pancake.\n",
      "9. **Frying Krokiety:** Shallow fry the krokiety in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry for about 3 minutes on each side, using enough oil to cook the sides of the krokiet.\n",

      "Serve the krokiety with Polish beetroot soup (\"Barszcz\") or enjoy them on their own. Smacznego!\n",

      "\n",
      "**INGREDIENTS**\n",
      "\n",
      "* 2 cups granulated sugar\n",
      "* ½ cup water\n",
      "* 6 Tablespoons butter\n",
      "* ½ cup light corn syrup\n",
      "* 1 teaspoon baking soda\n",
      "* 1-½ teaspoons vanilla extract\n",
      "* 1-½ cups your favorite chopped nuts  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**INSTRUCTIONS**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In a pot on the stove, over medium to medium-high heat, bring the sugar, water, butter, and corn syrup to a boil until it turns an amber color and reaches 300℉ on a candy thermometer (the hard-crack stage). This will take approximately 10 minutes. During this time, DO NOT stir the mixture...we want to avoid crystallization and burning of the sugar. You also may have to make slight adjustments to the heat on your stove to get it to the correct temperature.\n",
      "2. Once your mixture has reached the hard-crack stage (300℉ on a candy thermometer), remove the pot from the heat and immediately stir in the baking soda and vanilla extract. Be aware that it will bubble and foam up quite a bit as soon as you add the baking soda, so be ready!\n",
      "3. Next, stir in the chopped nuts.\n",
      "4. Finally, pour the finished nut brittle onto a parchment or silicone mat lined baking sheet and spread it out into a thin layer using a silicone spatula (or another spatula wiped down with a little bit of oil).\n",
      "5. Let cool for 1 hour at room temperature.\n",
      "6. After that hour, you can now reward yourself by using your hands to break the brittle into pieces and enjoying to your heart's content!\n",

      "* 5 sprigs thyme, bundled together with kitchen twine\n",
      "* 6-7 cups prepared stock from above or use chicken broth\n",
      "* 4 cups chopped or shredded leftover turkey; use in addition to any meat you pull off the turkey carcass\n",
      "* ¾ cup pastina or ditalini\n",
      "* 1 lemon, juiced\n",
      "* ½ cup fresh parsley, minced\n",

      "**Make the stock:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Place the turkey carcass in a large stockpot and cover with 12 cups water. You may need more depending on the size of the carcass. Try your best to immerse the bird with water, but if your pot isn’t big enough, it’s ok if the back bone sticks out a bit. Add a big pinch of salt to the water.\n",
      "2. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 2-3 hours. You may wish to flip the bird once during simmering. The liquid should reduce by almost half.\n",
      "3. Cover the pot (with foil, if the turkey is sticking out) and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.\n",
      "4. The next day, remove the carcass from the stock. Pick off any remaining meat and set it aside in a bowl to be added to the soup. Discard the carcass.\n",
      "5. If the stock is very gelatinous, place it on the heat over medium-high just until the gelatin melts, and the stock returns to a liquid. Turn off the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve.\n",
      "6. Give the pot a quick rinse and wipe it out. Return it to the stovetop.\n",

      "* Sliced cucumber \n",
      "\n",
      "**Directions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Cook your rice a minute shorter than what the packaging states. If using freshly cooked rice, spread it out on a tray to cool slightly. If you are using leftover rice - that's even better - break up any clumps.\n",
      "2. Cut the leek in half and slice into rings of 1 cm. Dice the carrot, and cut the pointed cabbage and onion. If you use other vegetables, or left-over vegetables, cut them in bite-sized pieces as well. You can basically use any vegetable you like.\n",
      "3. Gather the spices: turmeric, ginger, cilantro, cumin, garlic. Chop the shrimp paste, this is optionally. And grab your sambal.\n",
      "4. Heat a large pan or wok over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of neutral oil and sauté the onion until fragrant and translucent.\n",
      "5. Turn your wok down to low heat. Add the spices, the shrimp paste and the sambal to the wok. If using sambal, adjust the amount according to your desired level of spiciness. Wok for 3 minutes.\n",
      "6. Add the vegetables to the wok. Heat your wok over medium heat. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened.\n",
      "7. Add 1/3 of the cooked rice to the wok. And then add the kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce). Use a spatula to break up any clumps and mix the rice with the vegetables and spices.\n",
      "8. Add the other 2/3 of the cooked rice and the chopped celery leaves. Continue stir-frying the rice for about 5 more minutes until all the rice has turned brown and yellowish. Optionally you can now make a sunny side up egg in another pan. I really like a sunny side up egg as a condiment to this nasi goreng recipe. \n",
      "9. Remove your nasi goreng from heat and serve on the plate with condiments such as: prawn crackers, store-bought atjar tjampoer (mixed pickled vegetables), sambal (Indonesian chili sauce), and your sunny side up egg.Selamat makan! (Enjoy your meal)\n",
