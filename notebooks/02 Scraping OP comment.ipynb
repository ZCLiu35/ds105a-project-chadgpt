      "1. **Cooking Sauerkraut:** Place sauerkraut with the juice in a pot and add enough water to cover it. Include bay leaves and allspice berries. Simmer on low heat until softened, approximately 3-4 hours. Add more liquid as necessary to keep the sauerkraut submerged.\n",
      "2. **Preparing Mushrooms:** Place dried wild mushrooms in a glass jug or a small pot. Pour boiling water over them to cover. After 15 minutes, when they are soft, remove and chop them. Reserve the mushroom water for later use, being careful to avoid any sand at the bottom.\n",
      "3. **Frying Onions and Mushrooms:** In a frying pan over medium heat, fry onions until they soften but do not brown, about 5 minutes. Then add sliced white mushrooms, increase the heat, and cook until the mushrooms start to brown. Season with Vegeta and black pepper to taste, then remove from the stove.\n",
      "4. **Making Pancakes:** Blend all pancake ingredients until a smooth batter forms. Cook pancakes on a medium-sized non-stick frying pan. Pour a small amount of batter into the hot, oiled pan and spread it around by swirling. Once the pancake is set, remove it and place it on a plate. Repeat until all pancakes are made.\n",
      "5. **Combining Filling Ingredients:** Once the cabbage is cooked, strain it from the liquid and remove the spices. Let it cool enough to handle, then chop finely. Mix with both the re-hydrated and fried mushrooms and onions. Season with sugar, black pepper, and salt to taste.\n",
      "6. **Rolling Krokiety:** Spread about 2 tablespoons of filling inside each pancake. Fold the left and right sides inward, then roll up the pancake.\n",
      "7. **Coating Krokiety:** Whisk 2 eggs in a bowl. Dip each krokiet in the egg, then coat with breadcrumbs. Prepared krokiety can be refrigerated for up to three days before frying if needed.\n",
      "8. **Preparing for Frying:** Spread about 2 tablespoons of filling inside each pancake. Fold the left and right sides inward, then roll up the pancake.\n",
      "9. **Frying Krokiety:** Shallow fry the krokiety in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry for about 3 minutes on each side, using enough oil to cook the sides of the krokiet.\n",

      "Serve the krokiety with Polish beetroot soup (\"Barszcz\") or enjoy them on their own. Smacznego!\n",

      "* 2 cups granulated sugar\n",
      "* Â½ cup water\n",
      "* 6 Tablespoons butter\n",
      "* Â½ cup light corn syrup\n",

      "**INSTRUCTIONS**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. In a pot on the stove, over medium to medium-high heat, bring the sugar, water, butter, and corn syrup to a boil until it turns an amber color and reaches 300â„‰ on a candy thermometer (the hard-crack stage). This will take approximately 10 minutes. During this time, DO NOT stir the mixture...we want to avoid crystallization and burning of the sugar. You also may have to make slight adjustments to the heat on your stove to get it to the correct temperature.\n",
      "2. Once your mixture has reached the hard-crack stage (300â„‰ on a candy thermometer), remove the pot from the heat and immediately stir in the baking soda and vanilla extract. Be aware that it will bubble and foam up quite a bit as soon as you add the baking soda, so be ready!\n",
      "3. Next, stir in the chopped nuts.\n",
      "4. Finally, pour the finished nut brittle onto a parchment or silicone mat lined baking sheet and spread it out into a thin layer using a silicone spatula (or another spatula wiped down with a little bit of oil).\n",
      "5. Let cool for 1 hour at room temperature.\n",
      "6. After that hour, you can now reward yourself by using your hands to break the brittle into pieces and enjoying to your heart's content!\n",

      "* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n",
      "* 5 sprigs thyme, bundled together with kitchen twine\n",
      "* 6-7 cups prepared stock from above or use chicken broth\n",

Try your best to immerse the bird with water, but if your pot isnâ€™t big enough, itâ€™s ok if the back bone sticks out a bit. Add a big pinch of salt to the water.\n",
      "2. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 2-3 hours. You may wish to flip the bird once during simmering. The liquid should reduce by almost half.\n",
      "3. Cover the pot (with foil, if the turkey is sticking out) and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.\n",
      "4. The next day, remove the carcass from the stock. Pick off any remaining meat and set it aside in a bowl to be added to the soup. Discard the carcass.\n",
      "5. If the stock is very gelatinous, place it on the heat over medium-high just until the gelatin melts, and the stock returns to a liquid. Turn off the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve.\n",
