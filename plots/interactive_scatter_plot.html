Pat the chicken tenderloins dry and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Set up your dredging station:**\n\n1. Set out three shallow dishes. To the first dish, add flour, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and a pinch of salt. To the second dish, add 2 eggs plus 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and whisk until smooth. Add panko with a pinch of salt and pepper to the third dish.\n\n**Preheat the oil:**\n\n1. Add about \u00bc inch of neutral oil to a wide pot or skillet. You only need enough oil to come up to half the thickness of a chicken tender. Turn the heat to medium-low to preheat the oil.\n\n**Dredge the chicken:**\n\n1. Dip a chicken tenderloin into the flour and shake off the excess. Next, dip it into the egg mixture and shake off the excess. Finish dredging the chicken by rolling it gently in the panko; gently press it into the tender to ensure it adheres. Transfer to a baking rack. Continue until all tenders are dredged.\n\n**Heat the sauce:**\n\n1. Simmer the remaining 1 cup of hot sauce over low heat as you fry the chicken tenders.\n\n**Fry the chicken tenders:**\n\n1. Turn the heat on the oil to medium. If you drop a piece of panko into the pot, it should bubble and sizzle but not overly vigorously. You can use a meat thermometer to ensure it is 350\u00baF.\n2. Once the oil is hot, fry the chicken tenders in batches, about 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown. Once the tenders reach 165\u00baF, transfer them to a cooling rack or paper towel-lined plate.\n\n**Sauce the tenders:**\n\n1. Once all the chicken tenders are fried, pour the warm sauce into a large bowl.\n2. Add the chicken tenders to the bowl in batches and toss gently to coat in the sauce.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Transfer the sauced tenders to a serving platter and sprinkle with minced scallions.

Place warm milk in a mixing bowl, add yeast, and give it a stir. Let it sit for a minute or two while you\u2019re gathering your other ingredients. \n2. Next, add sugar, eggs, butter, salt, and vanilla, and mix well. Lastly, using a dough hook, add flour and mix until it forms a firm yet tacky dough that pulls away from the edges. Resist adding more flour\u2026the dough should be slightly tacky.\n3. Remove dough from the mixer and knead by hand, on a lightly floured surface, for 5 minutes (yes, even if you used a stand mixer).\n\n***First Rising***\n\n1. Grease a large bowl with butter or cooking spray. Place the dough in this bowl, cover with a warm towel, and let sit in a warm spot for 1 to 1-\u00bd hours or until it doubles in size.\n\n***Cinnamon Roll Filling***\n\n1. In a bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until it resembles a paste.\n\n***Rolling out the dough, adding filling, and cutting into shape***\n\n1. For this step, I used silicone baking mats, but you can also roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring approximately 22\u201d x 14\u201d.\n2. Drop some of the cinnamon roll filling here and there over the rolled out dough. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently spread the filling all over the dough, keeping away from the edges by about a quarter inch.\n3. Starting at a short end (one of the 14\u201d ends), gently but tightly roll the dough into one long roll.\n4. Using a sharp knife (I found that a serrated knife worked best), cut the roll into 12 evenly sliced pieces. \n\n***Second Rising***\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350\u2109.\n2. Place the cut cinnamon rolls into a parchment-lined baking dish, three rows of four.\n3. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes, or until they\u2019ve nearly doubled in size.\n\n***Baking Cinnamon Rolls***\n\n1. Remove the plastic wrap and place baking pan in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 20 \u2013 30 minutes. My cinnamon rolls took 30 minutes to bake, but you should start checking on them after 20 minutes. All ovens are different. The cinnamon rolls will be done when the tops have just lightly browned and the dough sounds hollow when you lightly tap on it with a spoon. The rolls will rise even more while they\u2019re baking and will most likely touch each other. This is fine and good\u2026they\u2019ll stay soft in the middle.\n\n***Icing for Cinnamon Rolls***\n\n1. While the rolls are baking, make the icing. Using either a stand mixer or handheld mixer, blend together cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla until smooth. \n2. When the cinnamon rolls are done baking, let them cool about 5 minutes and add icing to the tops, so it will slightly melt and ooze between the swirls. If you prefer the icing thicker on top, wait until they\u2019ve fully cooled.", "created_utc": 1704476711000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9599609375, "link_flair_text": "Recipe", "author": "pangibear", "url": "https://i.redd.it/7uef78dbsnac1.jpeg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18zcqmd/cinnamon_rolls/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18zcqmd/cinnamon_rolls/", "bbcgf_title": "Cinnamon rolls", "calories": 415.0, "salt": 0.9, "fat": 18.0, "sugars": 24.0, "saturates": 11.0, "carbs": 55.0, "protein": 8.0, "fibre": 2.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.8400000000000001}, {"id": "18vf164", "title": "Mushroom-Taleggio Risotto", "score": 184, "num_comments": 6, "ingredient_comment": "**Recipe here originally:** [**Mushroom-Taleggio Risotto Recipe**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/mushroom-taleggio-risotto-recipe/)\n\n* .5 ounces dry porcini mushrooms\n* 1 cup boiling water\n* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n* 1 leek, white and light green part only; trimmed, scrubbed thoroughly, and thinly sliced into half-moons\n* 1 cup arborio rice\n* 5\u20136 cups warm water or vegetable stock, more or less as needed\n* 4 ounces Taleggio cheese, rind removed\n* \u00bd cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving\n* 2 tablespoons finely minced parsley\n* 1 lemon, juiced\n* Sweet pea tendrils, optional, for serving\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Prepare the porcini mushrooms:**\n\n1.

First of all, try to remove your duck breast from the fridge 1 hour before you start cooking to make sure it will be at room temperature when you pan-sear the duck. Then peel your sweet potatoes and cut them into even-sized cubes. Add to a pan, together with 75 ml of water, 50 grams of butter, and a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a simmer and turn low. Let this simmer for about 25 minutes.\n2. In the meantime, it is time to prepare the sauce. Finely chop the shallot and saute for 2 minutes on medium heat. Add your stock and port wine and reduce by half or until the reduction thickens. Set this aside, clean your mushrooms and finely chop your garlic. Heat your frying pan and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Fry your sage leaves in the oil for about 20-30 seconds or until crispy and put them on a piece of kitchen paper. \n3. Now we are getting there! Preheat your oven to 160 degrees Celsius. Score the fat side of the duck breast (but not too deep) and add it to the already hot pan with the fat side down. Make sure your pan is on medium heat and let the fat render for about 5 minutes or until evenly golden and crispy. Then turn over the duck breast, add a small knob of butter to the pan, and baste your duck for two more minutes. Now add this to an oven dish and continue cooking for about 8 more minutes or until a core temperature of 53 degrees Celsius. \n4. In the meantime, we fry our mushrooms with half of the garlic and a bit of olive oil until nicely golden, add them to an ovenproof dish, and put them in the oven next to the duck. Now add some olive oil the rest of the garlic and your spinach to the pan. Saute until it is fragrant and welted down and set aside. Now you mash your sweet potatoes with a tbsp of cream and salt and pepper to taste. Since we used only a little bit of water, we didn't have to drain them before mashing them to create the ultimate texture and flavor. reheat your port reduction and cut off the heat again, add 50 grams of cold butter and combine with a whisk. \n5. After your duck hits 53 degrees Celsius you let it rest on your counter for about 10 minutes and then we are ready to plate the dish. Start with a layer of your potato puree and add the spinach and mushrooms on top. Slice your duck into 6 pieces and add 3 pieces to both plates (like in the picture). Finish with the sauce and crispy sage leaves and your dish is finished.

Then add bell peppers and mushrooms, cooking until they soften, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n3. Add the Bomba rice to the pan, stirring to ensure it's well coated with the oils and juices.Cook the rice for about 2 minutes until it starts to become translucent. Stir in paprika, turmeric, ground cumin, and a pinch of saffron.\n4. Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Let it simmer gently for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to evenly distribute the heat.\n5. Add the tomato wedges and nestle the king prawns into the rice. Continue to cook for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and cooked through, and the rice is tender. You can cover the pan at this stage with a lid and do not stir it to develop delicious soccarat.\n6. Remove the pan from the heat. Squeeze in the juice of one lime and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan back with a lid and let it rest for 5 minutes.\n7. Sprinkle the paella with chopped parsley for a fresh finish. Serve directly from the pan, ensuring each portion includes some of the delicious socarrat (caramelized and slightly crispy layer of rice that forms at the bottom of the pan)\n\nOriginally posted: [Chorizo &amp; Prawn Paella](https://chefsbinge.com/paella-with-prawns-chorizo/)", "created_utc": 1702126281000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9501953125, "link_flair_text": "Recipe", "author": "mienczaczek", "url": "https://i.redd.it/w2as8wx8n95c1.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18ecyxp/chorizo_prawns_paella/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18ecyxp/chorizo_prawns_paella/", "bbcgf_title": "Chicken & chorizo paella", "calories": 563.0, "salt": 1.9, "fat": 16.0, "sugars": 5.0, "saturates": 5.0, "carbs": 62.0, "protein": 38.0, "fibre": 7.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.96}, {"id": "18ecqmn", "title": "Candied Walnuts with chili flakes", "score": 85, "num_comments": 3, "ingredient_comment": "Full recipe: [~https://servedwithrice.com/candied-walnuts-with-a-twist/~](https://servedwithrice.com/candied-walnuts-with-a-twist/)\n\n**Ingredients**\u00a0\n\n* Walnuts: half a pound\n* Sugar: about 40g\n* Extras: half a teaspoon of salt, and a pinch of dried chili flakes\n\n(alternatives to chili flakes include vanilla extract, and/or cinammon)\n\n**Instructions**\u00a0\n\n1.

Place the turkey carcass in a large stockpot and cover with 12 cups water. You may need more depending on the size of the carcass. Try your best to immerse the bird with water, but if your pot isn\u2019t big enough, it\u2019s ok if the back bone sticks out a bit. Add a big pinch of salt to the water.\n2. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 2-3 hours. You may wish to flip the bird once during simmering. The liquid should reduce by almost half.\n3. Cover the pot (with foil, if the turkey is sticking out) and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.\n4. The next day, remove the carcass from the stock. Pick off any remaining meat and set it aside in a bowl to be added to the soup. Discard the carcass.\n5. If the stock is very gelatinous, place it on the heat over medium-high just until the gelatin melts, and the stock returns to a liquid. Turn off the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve.\n6. Give the pot a quick rinse and wipe it out. Return it to the stovetop.\n\n**Cook the soup aromatics:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and fennel.

Cook your rice a minute shorter than what the packaging states. If using freshly cooked rice, spread it out on a tray to cool slightly. If you are using leftover rice - that's even better - break up any clumps.\n2. Cut the leek in half and slice into rings of 1 cm. Dice the carrot, and cut the pointed cabbage and onion. If you use other vegetables, or left-over vegetables, cut them in bite-sized pieces as well. You can basically use any vegetable you like.\n3. Gather the spices: turmeric, ginger, cilantro, cumin, garlic. Chop the shrimp paste, this is optionally. And grab your sambal.\n4. Heat a large pan or wok over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of neutral oil and saut\u00e9 the onion until fragrant and translucent.\n5. Turn your wok down to low heat. Add the spices, the shrimp paste and the sambal to the wok. If using sambal, adjust the amount according to your desired level of spiciness. Wok for 3 minutes.\n6. Add the vegetables to the wok. Heat your wok over medium heat. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened.\n7. Add 1/3 of the cooked rice to the wok. And then add the kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce). Use a spatula to break up any clumps and mix the rice with the vegetables and spices.\n8. Add the other 2/3 of the cooked rice and the chopped celery leaves. Continue stir-frying the rice for about 5 more minutes until all the rice has turned brown and yellowish. Optionally you can now make a sunny side up egg in another pan. I really like a sunny side up egg as a condiment to this nasi goreng recipe. \n9. Remove your nasi goreng from heat and serve on the plate with condiments such as: prawn crackers, store-bought atjar tjampoer (mixed pickled vegetables), sambal (Indonesian chili sauce), and your sunny side up egg.Selamat makan!

Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F / 230\u00b0C . If using a cast iron skillet, add 1 Tbsp Shortening and place it in the oven to preheat.\r\n2. Whisk together 2 cups Flour, all-purpose, 1 Tbsp Baking powder, 1/2 tsp Baking soda, and 1 tsp Salt, fine sea in a large mixing bowl. Note: If you are using milk instead of buttermilk, leave out the baking soda. Baking soda reacts with the acid in the buttermilk to help with leavening, if milk is used then it is not needed.\r\n3. Cut \u00bc cup Butter, unsalted into cubes then using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour mixture. If you do not have a pastry blender you can either use two knives and slash them against each other, use your hands to squish the butter or if you have a food processor you can pulse it a few times.\r\n4. Gradually add 1 cup Buttermilk (or milk) to the dry ingredients, if using milk you will need less of it since it isn't as thick. Depending on your environment, you may not need all of the buttermilk or you may need a bit more. The dough should be sticky but not too wet that you cannot handle it. If it becomes too sticky, simply add a bit more flour.\r\n5. Dust a clean, flat surface with some flour and scoop out the dough. Sprinkle some flour on it then using your hands, knead a few times into a ball then fold the dough over itself 2 \u2013 3 times.\r\n6. Pat the dough to about an \u00bd-inch in thickness. The thicker the dough, the higher the biscuits will be so feel free to adjust to your preference, you will just end up with more or less biscuits depending on thickness.\r\n7. Cut the biscuits out with a biscuit cutter, cookie cutter or a cleaned out empty can. Set the biscuits aside.\r\n8. Take the dough scraps, knead them together, pat it out, and cut out some more biscuits. You should end up with 8-9 biscuits.\r\n9. Once they are all cut, remove the cast iron skillet from the oven and carefully place each biscuit into the hot oil (if using). Carefully flip over each biscuit so both sides are coated in oil, this will ensure both sides get browned. You want to place them closer together but not touching. As they start to expand, they will be forced to expand upwards instead of outwards.\r\n10. Carefully place the pan back into the oven and bake for 10 minutes.\r\n11. Check to see if they are golden brown and if so then remove from the oven. If they need more time, rotate the pan and keep an eye on them as they should be ready to pull within a few minutes.", "created_utc": 1697944136000, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "link_flair_text": "Recipe", "author": "New_Organization_661", "url": "https://i.redd.it/cxdffklwwnvb1.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17dinyf/homestyle_buttermilk_biscuits/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17dinyf/homestyle_buttermilk_biscuits/", "bbcgf_title": "Butter biscuits", "calories": null, "salt": null, "fat": null, "sugars": null, "saturates": null, "carbs": null, "protein": null, "fibre": null, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.72}, {"id": "17cim3c", "title": "Shrimp &amp; Broccoli Soba Noodles with Dashi-Soy Dipping Sauce", "score": 19, "num_comments": 1, "ingredient_comment": "**Recipe Link:** https://sowthetable.com/soba-noodles-with-shrimp-broccoli/\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 bunches of soba noodles (small packages will have 3 bundles)\n* 1lb of peeled and deveined shrimp\n* 1 small bundle of broccolini or 1 crown of broccoli \n* 1 clove of garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon of neutral oil\n* 1 tablespoon soy sauce\n* 1 cup of dashi or chicken broth (you can use HonDashi to make it quick)\n* 1/4 cup soy sauce\n* 2 1/2 tablespoons mirin\n* 1/2 teaspoon of grated ginger\n* 1 green onion, chopped\n* \\*optional: for garnishes, you could use green onion, sesame seeds, bean sprouts, sliced chili, chili oil, cilantro, etc. Toss in as many steamed veggies as you like!\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.

Preheat the oven to 205\u00b0C/400\u00b0F.\n2. In a large bowl, whisk together the\u00a0**flour**,\u00a0**baking powder**,\u00a0**salt**,\u00a0**black pepper**,\u00a0**crushed dried chilies**, and\u00a0**chili flakes**.\n3. Cut the\u00a0**butter**\u00a0into cubes, then rub it into the flour mixture using your finger tips. Continue until the pieces of butter are pea-sized or smaller, and evenly distributed throughout. Sprinkle in all of the\u00a0**chopped herbs**\u00a0and 100g of the **grated\u00a0cheese**. Mix again until well combined.\n4. Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in 100g of\u00a0**cream**. Stir through the **dijon\u00a0mustard**, then combine the dry and wet ingredients until you arrive at a soft-but-firm dough that just comes together when pressed in your hand. If necessary, add up to 20g more of cream \u2014 a good way to do this is to remove the well-formed dough from the bowl and add liquid only to the dry crumbs remaining at the bottom, bit by bit. This enables you to hydrate only the parts of the mixture that need it, and avoids over-moistening the already-ready parts of the dough.\n5. Tip the mixture out onto a lightly floured surface and use the palm of your hand as little as you can to pat it out into a rough circle, about 2cm/\u00bein thick. Using a lightly floured 5.5cm/2\u2033 wide glass or biscuit cutter, cut out 9 or so scones, reforming the dough into a rough disk as needed in between rounds of cutting.\n6. At this point, if you have room in your fridge or freezer, place the scones on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and transfer them to either to cool. In the meantime, bring a small pan of salted water to a boil. Pop in your reserved\u00a0**sage leaves**\u00a0for 30-45 seconds, just long enough to blanch them, then transfer them to a plate lined with a dish towel and pat them dry. Doing this will help prevent the leaves from shrivelling up too much and burning in the oven while the scones bake. At this point you may also want to brush each sage leaf with a bit of\u00a0**olive oil**, although you don\u2019t have to \u2014 it\u2019ll make the leaves extra crisp.\n7. Remove the scones from the fridge or freezer if you left them to chill. Brush each scone top with a bit of\u00a0**cream**, then sprinkle the **remaining\u00a0cheese**\u00a0evenly over each scone, and top each one with a\u00a0**sage leaf**.\u00a0\n8. Bake for 17 minutes or so (every oven is different!), or until the scones have well risen and their cheesy tops look crisp and golden. Once out of the oven, they should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Serve immediately, or enjoy for up to 4 days post-bake: simply store in an airtight container at room temperature and reheat in the oven before savouring again.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n**Notes:**\u00a0When it comes to scones, you want to keep the butter cold until the very end to maximise the level of flakiness in your finished bake. One way to do this is to chill the butter before you combine it with the other ingredients, and then, once shaped, to chill the unbaked scones once more just before placing them in the oven.\u00a0[For more tips and details, feel free to check out the whole post here](https://www.allo-simone.com/recipes-en/savoury-sage-scones/) :)", "created_utc": 1694270009000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Recipe", "author": "fuzzician", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ue2h1xrsd8nb1.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/16e5wv7/sage_scones_with_cheddar_chives/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/16e5wv7/sage_scones_with_cheddar_chives/", "bbcgf_title": "Cheddar & sage scones", "calories": 207.0, "salt": 0.6, "fat": 11.0, "sugars": 1.0, "saturates": 6.0, "carbs": 21.0, "protein": 7.0, "fibre": 1.0, "bbcgf_ratings": null}, {"id": "16cmifs", "title": "A Very Delicious Potato Salad", "score": 157, "num_comments": 15, "ingredient_comment": "Original post: [Asian Fusion Potato Salad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l52Avidfvo8)\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 2 tsp Celtic sea salt (other sea salt will do)\n* 2 tbsp Japanese rice vinegar\n* 2 tsp Ground black pepper\n* 4 tbsp Olive oil extra virgin\n* 3 tbsp Sesame oil\n* 2 cup Mayonnaise\n* 1 Red onion\n* 1.5 kg Potato\n* \u00bd cup Coriander\n* 5 stalks Celery\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1.

To prepare bubble and squeak, start by chopping cooked cabbage or Brussels sprouts, carrots, and any optional meat into small pieces, ensuring the meat is heated through if using leftovers.  \n2. Season the mashed potatoes with salt and pepper if needed. Saut\u00e9 finely chopped onion in a large skillet with butter or oil until soft and translucent. Add the chopped vegetables and meat to the skillet, cooking for about 5-6 minutes to meld flavours.  \n3. Gently fold in the cold mashed potatoes, being careful not to over-mash. Flatten the mixture in the skillet with a spatula and cook over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, allowing the bottom to crisp and turn golden brown. Carefully flip the bubble and squeak using a plate or spatula, adding more butter or oil and crisping the other side for an additional 10-15 minutes. Optionally, melt grated cheese on top during the last few minutes of cooking.  \n4. Once both sides are golden and crispy, remove from heat, cut into wedges, and serve hot. Enhance with a drizzle of Worcestershire sauce or hot sauce, if desired. This dish creatively repurposes leftovers into a harmonious medley of flavours and textures, celebrating the art of resourceful cooking.  \nFind this recipe at https://cookeryhq.com/discovery/658", "created_utc": 1692953558000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9501953125, "link_flair_text": "Recipe", "author": "CookeryHQ", "url": "https://i.redd.it/pyoqqzl6p7kb1.png", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/160sk3v/bubble_and_squeak/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/160sk3v/bubble_and_squeak/", "bbcgf_title": "Bubble & squeak", "calories": 212.0, "salt": 0.89, "fat": 13.0, "sugars": 4.0, "saturates": 5.0, "carbs": 20.0, "protein": 7.0, "fibre": 3.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9}, {"id": "15sh5i2", "title": "Leek and Potato Soup", "score": 150, "num_comments": 6, "ingredient_comment": "This leek and potato soup is is one of my most comforting soups, with the calories to prove it. \n\nRecipe here: [Leek and potato soup](https://cookingtoentertain.com/best-leek-and-potato-soup/)\n\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n  \n\u2022 500 grams Potato peeled and diced\n\n\u2022 1 large Shallot I'm talking one of the palm sized ones, not just a large baby shallot\n\n\u2022 2 large Leeks thinly slice the white part\n\n\u2022 70 grams Butter\n\n\u2022 1 cup Heavy Cream\n\n\u2022 1 cup Milk\n\n\u2022 Salt to taste\n\n\u2022 Black Pepper freshly cracked, to taste\n\n\u2022 1 Egg Yolk cured (homemade)\n\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**\n \n1.

Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps to remove any excess starch.\n\n\n2. In a pot, add the rinsed rice, vegetable oil, and salt and + 1/2 water of the quantity of rice measured with cups. \n\n\n3. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.\n\n\n4. Once the water starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer the rice for about 15 minutes, or until it is fully cooked.\n\n\n5. Once the rice is cooked, let it cool down to room temperature. This will help to ensure that the grains separate easily later on.\n\n\n**Step 2: Marinating the Chicken**\n\n1. Cut the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces and place them in a bowl.\n\n\n2. Add salt, black pepper, extra virgin olive oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, and oregano to the bowl.\n\n\n3. Mix well until the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade.\n\n\n4. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes, or for even better flavor, refrigerate it for a few hours.\n\n**Step 3: Preparing the Vegetables**\n\n1. Peel and dice the carrots into small cubes.\n\n\n2. Remove the seeds from the green bell pepper and chop it into small pieces.\n\n\n3. Thinly slice the red onion.\n\n\n4. Finely chop the chives.\n\n\n**Step 4: Cooking the Chicken**\n\n1. Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add oil.\n\n\n2. Add the marinated chicken to the pan and fry until it is cooked through and golden brown. Set aside.\n\n\n**Step 5: Scrambling the Eggs**\n\n1. In a separate pan, heat some oil over medium heat.\n\n\n2. Crack the eggs into the pan and scramble them until they are fully cooked. Set aside.\n\n**Step 6: Stir-Frying the Vegetables and Rice**\n\n1. In the same pan, add some oil, minced garlic, ginger, and 1 maggi cube. Stir for a short while.\n\n\n2. Add the diced carrots to the pan and fry for about 1 minute.\n\n\n3. Add the green bell pepper, red onion, and any other desired vegetables. Fry for about 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally.\n\n\n4. Remove the vegetables from the pan and set them aside.\n\n\n5. In the same pan, add the rest of the ginger, garlic, and 2 maggi cubes.

Remove the pot from the heat and let the strawberry mixture cool for a few minutes.\n\n\n15. Transfer the strawberry mixture to a blender and blend until smooth.\n\n\n16. To remove the seeds and any pulp, strain the strawberry puree using a fine-mesh sieve.\n\n\n17. Allow the strawberry puree to cool down for a while.\n\n\n18.

Add the meat back into the pot with light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine sugar, and oyster sauce. Stir to evenly distribute the sauce. Then add bay leaves, star anise, and dried orange peel.\n4.

Add cornstarch mixture (pre-mix this in a separate bowl before adding into the IP) and allow the ingredients to simmer until the sauce thickens.

To make this chicken dish, start by mixing the marinade in a ziplock bag or container. If using a container, you may need to increase the marinade by 50%.\n2. Add the chicken to the marinade and massage it from the outside to coat it well. Place the bag or container in the fridge to marinate for at least 3 hours, or up to 24 hours.\n3. When you're ready to cook the chicken, you can do it on the stove or on a BBQ. The spices in the marinade will give the chicken a nice crust and a delicious aroma.\n4. After cooking the chicken, let it rest for at least 3 minutes before slicing or serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute throughout the flesh, rather than running out when you cut into the meat.\n5.

Fill a small pot of water high enough to submerge two eggs completely. Bring to a boil.\n2. Once the water boils, gently lift the eggs into the water using a spoon. Set a timer for 6 minutes \\*(see notes!).\n3. After the timer goes off, drain the water and run the pan under cold water for 30 seconds to stop the eggs from cooking further.\n4. Crack the eggs at the bottom and carefully peel the eggs. Cut in quarters and season with sea salt and black pepper.\n5. Pick out the most beautiful herbs and salad leaves from your salad mix.\n6. Using your hands, tear them into bite-sized pieces. Soak them in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes and then allow them to dry on a paper towel.\n7. Cook the fresh peas briefly in boiling salted water until tender. Drain, rinse quickly in cold water and reserve in a small bowl.\n8. Cut the salmon into thinner pieces using scissors.\n9. Toast the bread until crispy around the edges and butter both of them.\n10. Spread a generous amount of the pea puree on the buttered toast.\n11. Add the quartered eggs, then wrap the smoked salmon pieces around the eggs.\n12. Garnish with the lettuce, herbs, fresh peas, a few cracks of black pepper, a little zest of lemon rind (using the Microplane), Maldon salt and olive oil.\n\n**Notes**\n\nIf you have really sweet fresh peas, you can serve them raw, but quick-cooking them is usually the better option.\n\nIf you\u2019re cooking eggs straight from your fridge, then 6 minutes + 30 seconds will be better. For eggs stored at room temperature (like here in Europe) 6 minutes is perfect. These times are for large eggs. If you have smaller eggs then you\u2019ll need to cut back on the cooking time.", "created_utc": 1681307837000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Recipe", "author": "Ghiveta", "url": "https://i.redd.it/b2gc8qwxagta1.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12jlf5x/15_minute_smoked_salmon_toast_with_eggs_herbs_and/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12jlf5x/15_minute_smoked_salmon_toast_with_eggs_herbs_and/", "bbcgf_title": "Poached & smoked salmon p\u00e2t\u00e9 with bagel toasts", "calories": 138.0, "salt": 1.2, "fat": 6.0, "sugars": 2.0, "saturates": 2.0, "carbs": 11.0, "protein": 12.0, "fibre": 1.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9}, {"id": "12jh955", "title": "Roasted cauliflower with mashed potatoes and beetroots", "score": 925, "num_comments": 40, "ingredient_comment": "How I made it?\r  \n\r  \nIngredients for 4 people:\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 1 cauliflower, about 1 medium-large head\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Extra virgin olive oil, to coat\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Sea salt\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 Black pepper\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 10 small/medium sized potatoes\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 \u00bc cup butter\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 \u00bd cup of Milk\r  \n\r  \n\u2022 300 grams of marinated beetroots\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nRecipe:\r  \n\r  \n1.

Prepare a baking tray by greasing it lightly with oil and lining it with parchment paper to keep it in place.\n\n**2.** For the cake batter, in a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until pale and fluffy. Reduce the speed to medium and gradually add the eggs one by one, ensuring they are well incorporated. Then, add the vanilla bean paste.\n\n**3.** Stop the mixer and add the sifted flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix on low speed until the ingredients are fully incorporated. If the mixture appears too thick, add two tablespoons of milk or water and incorporate it.\n\n**4.** Using a spatula, transfer the batter to the prepared baking tray and spread it evenly. Arrange the fruit on top; you can halve the strawberries, cut the rhubarb into chunks, and quarter the apricots.\n\n**5.** To prepare the crumble topping, place all the crumble ingredients in a bowl and rub the mixture between your fingers until it is almost combined. Sprinkle the crumble evenly over the fruit.\n\n**6.** Place the baking tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 40-45 minutes.\n\n**7.** Once the cake is ready, allow it to cool for 10 minutes before serving. You can transfer it to a cooling rack, using a sheet of paper and the help of another person to expedite the cooling process.\n\n**8.** Enjoy your delicious cake with a cup of coffee!

Combine the chopped rhubarb, \u00bd cup sugar, and \u00bd cup water in a medium pot and bring to a boil.\n2. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30\u201345 minutes until very soft.\n3. Use an immersion blender to blend until completely smooth. You may also use a traditional blender or food processor. Just pour the mixture back into the pot.\n4. Let the rhubarb cool completely. Add the food coloring, if using, and mix well to incorporate.\n5. Remove \u00bd cup of the rhubarb mixture from the pot and reserve for the homemade ice cream.\n\n**Make the ice cream:**\n\n1. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a medium mixing bowl and add the vanilla extract. Stir to combine.\n2. Pour the heavy cream into a large mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, mix on medium speed until thick, stiff peaks form.\n3. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into the heavy cream and gently fold everything together with a rubber spatula. Do not over-mix!\n4. Pour the cream mixture into an 8-inch cake pan or loaf pan. Drizzle the reserved \u00bd cup of rhubarb on top and use the rubber spatula to swirl and mix into the cream gently.\n5. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap. The wrap should be completely in contact with the ice cream without air bubbles. Use your hands to pat it down as tightly as possible. If there are air bubbles, ice crystals will form and make the top of your ice cream icy. Be sure the wrap is in contact with the ice cream from edge to edge. Transfer to the freezer until it is completely frozen, at least 4 hours.\n\n**Prepare the tart crust:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350\u00baF.\n2. Place the pecans in a food processor and pulse them into a fine meal. Transfer to a mixing bowl with the flour and powdered sugar. Add \u00bc teaspoon salt.\n3. Melt the butter in the microwave or a small saucepan over the stovetop. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Let stand for 5 minutes. Pour the butter into the bowl of flour and pecans and use a rubber spatula to mix until there are no dry bits of flour and the dough is smooth and moist.\n4. Place the dough into a 10\u201d greased pie dish or tart pan. Use your hands to smooth it into the dish and up the sides in an even layer. Transfer to the oven for 15 minutes. Remove and let stand for 30 minutes. Keep the oven at 350\u00baF.\n\n**Finish the filling:**\n\n1. Add the egg yolks and remaining \u00bd cup sugar to the pot of the remaining rhubarb. Turn the heat back to medium and whisk until completely smooth.\n2. Add the cold, cubed butter and continue whisking until the heat melts the butter completely. It will take 2\u20133 minutes of regular whisking. Continue whisking until completely smooth. Turn off the heat and immediately pour into the prepared crust.\n\n**Bake the tart:**\n\n1. Transfer the tart to the oven for 15 minutes; carefully rotate the tart once midway through cooking.\n2. After 15 minutes, remove from the oven and do a jiggle check. It should be set up around the edges and slightly jiggly in the middle. It should wobble, not slosh. If it\u2019s still very jiggly around the edges, return to the oven and continue baking in 2-minute increments until the tart is set around the edges but still jiggly in the middle. It should not need more than 20 minutes in the oven.\n\n**Finish the tart:**\n\n1. Let the tart stand for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, transfer to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight before serving.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Slice the tart and carefully remove each piece. If you made this in a pie dish, it will be more difficult to serve but not impossible! Dust the tart with powdered sugar and serve with rhubarb ice cream on top.

In a medium bowl, combine heavy cream with sugar, and vanilla extract. Whip to a light, airy, whipped cream texture. Set aside.\n4. Dollop additional raspberry sauce on surface of the cheesecake (note: I like adding additional raspberry mixture to the raspberry dollops/cracks in the cheesecake) and decorate cheesecake with pipped Chantilly cream.

Add the butter and brown for approximately 6-8 minutes, or until you see brown bits at the bottom and a little bit of white foaming action on the surface. Once you see this turn the heat off and remove it from the stove. Let it cool down completely.\n2. In a small mixing bowl combine the all-purpose flour, salt, baking soda and matcha. Using a sifter sift the ingredients to remove any clumps. The matcha will oftentimes be clumped together. Sifting it will ensure the matcha is evenly mixed to create a vibrant green color.\n3. Take a mixing bowl and add the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar and mix until well mixed. Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix until you get a nice light creamy texture. Use a stand mixer to help mix it faster, but a hand mixer will also work fine. It will just take an extra minute or two to get the texture.\n4. Add the sifted dry ingredients to the wet and mix with a spatula. Hand mixing will ensure the dough will not raise and fall flat in the oven by adding excess air to the dough.\n5. Add the white chocolate chips and mix until well incorporated into the dough.\n6. Use a cookie scoop/ice cream scoop 3 tablespoons to scoop the cookie dough (I get 8 cookies with this recipe). I let the cookies rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.\n7. Take the cookies out of the fridge and preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.\n8. Cover your baking sheet with parchment paper and place the cookie dough 3 inches apart. Since this recipe uses less butter I like to roll the dough and press it down to give it a cookie flatten shape. Bake for 10-12 minutes.

I would also really appreciate any follows on social media channels if you like the site!\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 6 large egg whites\n* 335g caster sugar (super fine sugar in the US)\n* 300ml rich double cream\n* 180ml lemon curd\n* 250g raspberries\n* 250g blueberries\n* 70g crushed de-shelled pistachios\n* 2 passion fruit\n* fresh mint\n\n**METHOD**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 150\u00b0C (300\u00b0F). Line a flat tray with parchment paper, you will be baking the meringue on this and don't want it to stick to the surface. I use a 38cm \u00d7 35cm tray, but you can use any large flat rectangular tray that will fit into your oven. You will be rolling along the longer edge, so this will be the finished length of your roulade.\n2. Add the egg whites and half the caster sugar to a bowl, making sure that it's clean and completely dry before beginning. If there is any moisture left in the bowl, the egg whites won't form. whisk the mixture until it's formed light peaks. Once they have formed, gradually add the other half of the sugar until it forms stiff glossy peaks. This will take about 10-15 minutes. \n3. Spread the meringue mixture evenly onto the lined tray, squaring off the edges as best you can. Place in the oven and bake for one hour. It should be a very light golden colour when it's done. \n4. Remove tray from the oven and turn upside down onto a fresh sheet of parchment paper. Carefully peel off the backing sheet, working slowly and with a knife to scrape the paper gently away in one piece. There will be pockets of carmelised sugar stuck to the paper you want to get all those pieces off as they add a lovely gooey texture. \n5. Whip the double cream until thick and gently fold in the lemon curd, keeping the air you've incorporated during whipping. Spread the cream and curd mix over the flat meringue and cover with a layer of raspberries and blueberries, about 2/3 of the amount. \n6. Make a light score with a knife about 2cm in along one long edge of the meringue, this is going to help you as a starting point to roll it. From the indent, gently roll inwards away from yourself, using the paper underneath to help turn it as you go. You shouldn't be touching the surface of the meringue with your hands, use the paper to do that for you. The \"seam' will sit on the bottom once it's rolled. The outer surface will crack a little bit, you can patch it up if need be once it's served. \n7. When the roll is almost complete, grab the paper and use it to help you transfer the roulade to a plate. It's helpful if you have someone to give you a hand shifting it onto the serving plate, they can hold the plate steady while you transfer.

Prepare one batch of\u00a0Swiss Meringue Buttercream\u00a0(full step-by-step recipe and trouble shooting tips on the blog). A condensed recipe version is shown in steps below.\n2.  Clean bowl of your electric stand mixer. Add egg whites and sugar to the clean electric mixer bowl. Place bowl over double boiler \u2013 the bowl should not be touching the water). Whisk sugar and egg whites until the mixture is frothy and sugar has dissolved (\\~5 min). Check the temperature with a candy thermometer \u2013 when ready, the mixture will be at 160F (71C).\n3. Return egg white mixture to stand mixer. Whisk on medium-high speed. Beat until glossy, stiff, peaks form and mixture is no longer warm to the touch (\\~10 min). Once meringue has cooled, replace whisk attachment with a paddle attachment and reduce mixer speed to LOW.\n4. Begin adding butter. Continue until all butter has been added. Over the next 10-20 minutes, the mixture will turn from a smooth, loose mixture, to a curdled mixture, to one that barely pulls away from the bowl, and then ultimately to a smooth, sturdy buttercream! Continue to beat for another 3-5 min on LOW or fold by hand to remove excess air bubbles.\n5. Add 1/2 cup of chocolate cookie crumbs to the prepared vanilla Swiss Meringue Buttercream.

I also used the grams measurement.\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Measure your butter and chocolate out in a big bowl, then stick it on top of a saucepan with water (also known as a bain-marie) to melt it. Then, let the mixture cool, otherwise you\u2019ll cook the egg.\n\n2. Once mixture is cool, whisk in (I used a stand-mixer, but a good old handheld metal one will be fine, you\u2019ll just end up super hench) the sugar and eggs. \n\n3. Make sure to use a sieve to sift in your salt, cocoa powder and flour. Then use a spatula to fold in the dry ingredients, don\u2019t whisk!\n\n4. Add your mixture to a lined tray (I line mine with baking powder, I don\u2019t like just greasing it) and evenly spread out the mixture you have managed not to eat.\n\n5. Bake in the oven at 180 degrees celsius (pls google the F equivalent) for about 25 minutes, after 20 I usually stick a butter knife in. You want your knife to come out with bits of crumbs and goo, but not too much. You **DONT** want the knife to be clean.\n\n6. Leave to cool (I don\u2019t have a cooling rack to I put about an inch and a half of cold water into my sink and put the tray in there so it was half submerged). \n\nThey\u2019re nice to eat warm, cold etc. Just don\u2019t store them in the fridge, otherwise they\u2019ll go hard and weird.\n\nEnjoy :)", "created_utc": 1657229302000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Dessert", "author": "croissantbbyy", "url": "https://i.redd.it/9l0kwb1vy8a91.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/vts7bj/gooey_chocolate_brownies/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/vts7bj/gooey_chocolate_brownies/", "bbcgf_title": "Gooey brownies", "calories": 164.0, "salt": 0.16, "fat": 9.0, "sugars": 14.0, "saturates": 5.0, "carbs": 19.0, "protein": 2.0, "fibre": 0.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.82}, {"id": "votuid", "title": "Double Chocolate Cheesecake Bars", "score": 1309, "num_comments": 18, "ingredient_comment": "A buttery biscuit base is sprinkled with chocolate chips and topped with a layer of white chocolate cheesecake.\n\nRecipe video: [here](https://youtu.be/U0DcAnylKo8)\n\n**Ingredients***Base*\n\n* 250g packet shortbread biscuits (cookies)\n* 95g melted butter\n* 125g milk or dark chocolate chips\n\n*Topping*\n\n* 150g white chocolate\n* 375g softened cream cheese\n* 112g caster sugar\n* 2 large eggs\n* 40g sour cream\n\n**Directions**\n\n1.

You won\u2019t believe how easy it is to make this cookie dough!  \nvideo recipe [here](https://youtu.be/yO2uAJSlwoM)  \n**INGREDIENTS**  \n\\* 2 cups All-purpose flour  \n\\* 1 cup Cake flour  \n\\* 1/2 cup Granulated sugar  \n\\* 1 cup Brown sugar  \n\\* 1 Cup butter (2 sticks)  \n\\* 1 cup mini chocolate chips  \n\\* 3/4 Cup milk, plus more as needed  \n\\* 2 tsp vanilla extract  \n**INSTRUCTIONS**  \nPreparing the flour  \n1. Add all of the flour to a pan and turn the pan on medium high heat. Using a whisk, start mixing and shaking the pan ever so often.  \n2. Continue to roast until the flour is heated through and has darkened ever so slightly. The flour is ready when it smells similar to popcorn and doesn't appear dusty anymore - it should develop some texture. About 12-15 minutes.  \n3. Once done, immediately move the pan off the heat. Mix every 2-3 minutes to prevent any residual heat from burning the flour.  \nMaking the cookie dough  \n1. Soften the butter by microwaving for 20-30 seconds on high. In a large bowl, add in the sugars and butter. Start your stand mixer with the paddle attachment and run on medium speed. It will take about 30 seconds to a minute. You can also use a hand mixer.  \n2. When you have a smooth texture like peanut butter, add the 1/2 of the milk and all of the vanilla and mix again. Mix until the dough looks nice and fluffy and the colour is much paler. It will take about 30 seconds to 2 minutes.  \n3. Start adding in the flour, little bit at a time while you continue to mix on low speed. Continue to mix until you have added all of the flour and the dough has come together. If the dough appears crumbly or dry, add more milk, 1 Tbsp at a time.  \n4. Once the dough has come together, stop the mixer and add in the chocolate chips. Continue mixing until they are well combined. The dough should be soft and smooth - add more milk as required to achieve this texture.  \n5. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 20 minutes. Scoop the cookie dough and enjoy!  \nNotes: Don't leave the pan unsupervised at any point, the flour will burn and turn the cookie dough bitter.", "created_utc": 1647808109000, "upvote_ratio": 0.8100585938, "link_flair_text": "Dessert", "author": "cookingwithanadi", "url": "https://i.redd.it/9mb2331zllo81.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tiu2p5/chocolate_chip_edible_cookie_dough/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tiu2p5/chocolate_chip_edible_cookie_dough/", "bbcgf_title": "Edible cookie dough", "calories": 165.0, "salt": 0.4, "fat": 7.0, "sugars": 14.0, "saturates": 4.0, "carbs": 23.0, "protein": 1.0, "fibre": 1.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.6799999999999999}, {"id": "t8qg35", "title": "Raspberry Ruby-Chocolate Tart", "score": 79, "num_comments": 9, "ingredient_comment": "Hi, this is calm cooking.

Line three 6-inch cake pans with parchment. I recommend using cake strips for a more moist, even bake. Soak in water until ready for use. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F/180\u00b0C.\n2. Add the sugar to a large bowl of a stand mixer, then sift in the remaining dry ingredients.\n3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the liquid ingredients including the zest until fully combined.\n4. Add the bowl of dry ingredients to the stand mixer and while mixing on low, gradually pour in the wet ingredients.\n5. Mix for about 30 seconds or until most of the flour is just moistened and the batter is smooth with a few tiny lumps.\n6. Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a large spoon or silicone spatula to mix in any dry flour. Don\u2019t overmix.\n7. Evenly distribute the batter between the cake pans. If using cake strips, squeeze out excess water, wrap around each pan and secure.\n8. Place the pans in the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes with cake strips or about 20 to 25 minutes without. A skewer or toothpick inserted should come out clean.\n9. Fully cool the cakes in the pans before removing them.\n\n**Lemon Buttercream Frosting:**\n\n1. Add the vegan butter and confectioners\u2019 sugar to the stand mixer bowl.\n2. Add the bowl to the stand mixer and mix on low while gradually adding the lemon juice and vanilla.\n3. When smooth and creamy, remove about \u00bc cup of the frosting and set aside. Add the lemon zest and lemon extract to the remainder.\n4. Add enough food colouring to get your desired shade of yellow. The colour may darken as the frosting dries.\n\n**To Assemble:**\n\n1. Filling a piping bag, or zip-top bag with the corner snipped, with yellow frosting.\n2. Dab a bit of frosting on a cake board, stand or plate. Place the first cake layer on the board.\n3. Pipe a swirl of frosting on top, without gaps. Spread evenly then add the second cake layer.\n4. Add another swirl of frosting, then the final layer, bottom side up.\n5. Spread the top and sides with a thin layer of frosting to crumb coat. Place in the fridge for one hour or until the frosting is chilled.\n6. Spread the sides and top with the remaining yellow frosting and smooth.\n7. Dab some of the reserved white frosting at random spots on the cake. Smooth to add white streaks.\n8. Place the dried lemon slices on the cake and add dots of the remaining white frosting with a #2 piping tip.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* Warm lemons for about 20 seconds in the microwave, before cutting, for easier juicing.\n* Scrape the mixer beater as long strands of zest may stick to it.\n* Bottled lemon juice usually has citric acid added which can help add extra tartness and lemony flavour.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.

Once melted remove from the heat, coat each cake ball with the melted chocolate by dipping it into the chocolate. Remove the balls from the bowl with a fork.\n8. Place your chocolate covered bites onto your parchment paper to set.\n9.

Obviously the pastry could be shop-bought to simplify things if wanted!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients**\r  \n\r*For the pastry:*\r  \n\r\\- 300g plain white flour\r  \n\\- 30g white sugar\r  \n\\- 1/2 teaspoon fine salt\r  \n\\- 200g cold unsalted butter\r  \n\\- 1 egg yolk\r  \n\\- 3 tablespoons cold water (the colder, the better)\r  \n\n\n*For the filling:*\r  \n\r\\- 1 jar blissfully blackcurrant jam\r  \n\\- 130g ground almonds\r  \n\\- 30g plain white flour\r  \n\\- 100g caster sugar\r  \n\\- 110g unsalted butter at room temperature\r  \n\\- 2 eggs\r  \n\\- 1 teaspoon almond extract\r  \n \r  \n\r  \n**Method**\r  \n\r  \n1. For the pastry, start by adding the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor. Cut the cold butter (it needs to be cold and firm) into medium cubes (approximately 1x1 inch) and distrbute the cubes on top of the dry ingredients. Pulse 16 times.\r  \n\r  \n2. Turn off the food processor, add the egg yolk and turn it back on its lowest setting. While it is running, add 2-3 tablespoons of water and process for up to 10 seconds, just enough to combine. The pastry should still be quite crumbly after these steps.\r  \n\r  \n3. Turn the pastry onto a flat clean surface and, working it as little as possible, form it into a ball. Cover it tightly and put it in the fridge for 1 hour.\r  \n\r  \n4. Pre-heat the oven to 180C/160C Fan. Once the pastry has cooled, dust a flat surface with flour and roll out the dough medium-thin, or to the thickness of your liking, into a circle. Roll it up in a rolling pin and unfold it on a tart case. Use excess trimmings to fill up any gaps or holes (tip: use a small piece of dough as a tool to press the pastry against the case, ensuring it is well fit). Leave the overhangings for now, i.e. do not trim the edges, but do save a bit of dough in case you need to fill any holes later. \r  \n\r  \n5. Using a fork, make several holes throughout the bottom of the pastry. Place a piece of greaseproof baking paper on top of the tart case and top it with baking beans, rice or any other grain to weigh it down. Bake for 15-20mins.\r  \n\r  \n6. Remove the case from the oven, remove the baking paper and beans and bake it for another 5 minutes. Remove it from the oven and, while the pastry is still hot, use a serrated knife to carefully go around the edges of the case and trim them. Leave your knife as flat as possible for a smooth cut. Trimming the pastry at this stage rather than earlier reduces shrinkage.\r  \n\r  \n7. Set the pastry aside. For the filling, beat together the butter and sugar using an electric mixer for approximately 5 minutes, until light and fluffy.\r  \n\r  \n8. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well in between, and finally add the almond extract, beating once again to incorporate.\r  \n\r  \n9. Delicately fold in the ground almonds and flour, just until combined. Do not overmix or use an electric mixer for this stage.\r  \n\r  \n10. Line the tart case with a full jar of Blissfully Blackcurrant Jam, and delicately add the frangipane filling on top, using the back of a spoon to carefully spread it throughout the tart.\r  \n\r  \n11. Bake for 35-40mins until the frangipane has set. Let the tart cool fully before removing it from the case. Serve with creme fraiche, and be happy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Blog Post:** [**https://pantree.co/recipes/post/blackcurrant-bakewell-tart.html**](https://pantree.co/recipes/post/blackcurrant-bakewell-tart.html)", "created_utc": 1632492608000, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "link_flair_text": "Dessert", "author": "markandana_pantree", "url": "https://i.redd.it/o6ed09j59gp71.png", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/pujffo/blackcurrant_bakewell_tart/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/pujffo/blackcurrant_bakewell_tart/", "bbcgf_title": "Bakewell tart", "calories": 572.0, "salt": 0.77, "fat": 35.0, "sugars": 31.0, "saturates": 17.0, "carbs": 55.0, "protein": 9.0, "fibre": 1.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.72}, {"id": "ppq1sv", "title": "Matcha Madeleines with Matcha Glaze", "score": 307, "num_comments": 7, "ingredient_comment": "Video recipe can be found [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oK1ceVka7jc)\n\nIngredients:\n\nMadeleines:\r  \n\\-60g all purpose flour\r  \n\\-1/2tsp baking powder\r  \n\\-1/8tsp salt\r  \n\\-1tb matcha powder\r  \n\\-65g granulated white sugar\r  \n\\-1 egg\r  \n\\-1/2tb milk\r  \n\\-4tb melted butter\r  \n\r  \nGlaze:\r  \n\\-25g powdered sugar\r  \n\\-8g milk or water\r  \n\\-1/2tsp matcha powder\r  \n\r  \nSpecial Equipment:\r  \n\\-12 shell madeleine pan\r  \n\r  \nInstructions:\r  \n\t1) Sift the all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and matcha powder into a large bowl.\r  \n\t2) Add the white sugar into the bowl and mix to combine.\r  \n\t3) In a separate bowl, whisk the egg and milk together until a little bubbly.\r  \n\t4) Pour the egg mixture into the dry ingredients bowl, and mix with a spatula until all of the dry ingredients are moistened.\r  \n\t5) Add half of the butter, and mix until fully incorporated into the batter.

Over medium-low heat, saut\u00e9 one crushed garlic in 1 tablespoon olive oil for a minute and add the spinach (all of the spinach might not fit at once, but it will wilt a lot, so add one batch after another into the pan)\n2. With a kitchen tong, mix and turn spinach upside down until fully cooked (wilted and takes on a dark green color). Put in a bowl and set aside to cool down\n3. Finely chop the onion and saut\u00e9 in the empty pan with a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-low heat for a few minutes till translucent\n4. Crush in a garlic clove and saut\u00e9 together for another minutes\n5. Add the canned plum and cherry tomatoes by scrunching them through your clean hands over the pan\n6.

Season to taste with salt &amp; pepper\n8. Squeeze the spinach, which should have cooled down by now, and chop it in small pieces. Discard the spinach water\n9. In a big enough bowl, mix the spinach with the ricotta, an egg and a handful of grated Parmigiano Reggiano. Season to taste after thoroughly mixing it\n10. Spread a bit of tomato sauce over the casserole pan\n11. Start injecting the spinach-ricotta mix into the cannelloni (we used an icing-bag) and place them in the casserole pan\n12. Pour all of the remaining tomato sauce evenly over all cannelloni and sprinkle with a teaspoon of oregano\n13. Grate the cheese you want to use for the casserole's top: we used mozzarella \\[4.4 oz / 125 g\\], young gouda \\[4.4 oz / 125 g\\] and Parmigiano Reggiano \\[2.8 oz / 80 g\\]\n14.

Salted Butter\n\nOregano, Dried Oregano, Red Pepper Flakes, Salt &amp; Pepper, to taste\n\nParmesan Cheese &amp; Black Pepper for topping\n\nSteps\n\nSauce:\n\n1. In a large pan with high sides, (or a dutch oven), melt butter over medium-high heat.\n\n2. Once butter is melted, add diced onion and stir to coat with butter. Add a pinch of salt, cook onion until soft and translucent, stirring semi-frequently, about 5-10 minutes.\n\n3. Once the onion is cooked, add garlic to an open space in the pot and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly browned and fragrant. Once lightly browned, stir together with the onion.\n\n4. Push onion and garlic mixture to the edge of the pan and add the ground beef or lamb. Break up the meat with a wooden spoon, season with more salt, and cook until no pink remains.\n\n5. Once the meat is cooked, reduce the heat to medium then add tomato paste, grated carrot, and canned tomatoes. Stir to fully combine.\n\n6. Add herbs and spices to your liking, (about a teaspoon of each to start), and stir to combine.\n\n7. Allow sauce to simmer, and once the sauce has been reduced slightly, (less watery liquid), turn the heat to low and keep covered while you prepare the pasta. (I recommend lifting the lid occasionally to give a quick stir. Also, taste a small amount of the sauce and adjust the seasoning to your liking, such as adding more salt, pepper, basil, etc.)\n\nPasta &amp; Assembly:\n\n1. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat.\n\n2. Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add a generous amount of salt and stir to combine.\n\n3.

With about half a minute left in the pasta\u2019s cook time, reserve a small amount, (roughly half a cup), of the pasta water and set it aside.\n\n5. Drain pasta then immediately add to the pan with sauce. Toss to combine. (When combining the pasta and the sauce, slowly drizzle in some of the pasta water to help the sauce bind to the pasta. You don\u2019t need to use all of what you\u2019ve set aside, but it\u2019s better to have too much reserved than too little.)\n\n6. Remove the pan from the heat and serve.

The ingredients are simple and genuine, the making of tortellini requires a little time and commitment but the taste worth the effort without doubt.\n\nFun fact: Legend claims that Tortellini was inspired by the goddess Venus' navel. One evening after a day of battle between Bologna and Modena, Venus, Bacchus and Mars found refreshment at the inn Corona in Castelfranco Emilia. The next morning Mars and Bacchus moved away from the inn leaving Venus dormant;\n\nWhen she woke up, she called the other companions to hear where they were. the innkeeper came to see if he could help and saw the little-dressed goddess was so impressed by its splendid shapes that he returned to the kitchen and created a pasta inspired by Venus' navel\u2026and so was born the Tortellini.\n\nAs usual if you like the recipe and want to subscribe you are welcome\n\nVideo recipe [HERE](https://youtu.be/pM37CxZdXhk)\n\nServing for about 6 persons\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\nFor the filling\n\n* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) pork loin\n* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) mortadella\n* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )\n* 150 gr ( 5.29 ounce ) grated parmigiano\n* 10 gr ( 0.35 ounce )  butter\n* 2 eggs\n* nutmeg\n* black pepper\n* salt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the dough\n\n* 320 gr ( 11.29 ounce ) all-purpose  flour\n* 80 gr ( 2.82 ounce ) semolina flour\n* 4 eggs\n* 25 gr ( 0.88 ounce ) extra virgin olive oil\n* salt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**INSTRUCTION**\n\n* in a pan put 10 gr butter and 100 gr pork loin diced\n* let the pork loin brown well and drain from the excess of butter\n* in a meat grinder put the pork loin, 100 gr mortadella and 100 gr cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )\n* add to the mixture half nutmeg grated, 150 gr grated parmigiano, black pepper and 2 eggs\n* Mix well the mixture and add salt if needed ( you should taste the mixture because the flavor can vary depending on the type of cured ham and mortadella)\n* cover with a plastic wrap and let it rest for 2 hours\n\nNow let's prepare the homemade pasta as usual so 1 egg every 100 gr flours. For the flours we will use all-purpose and semolina flour in a proportion 4 to 1 so for this filling about 320 gr all-purpose and 80 gr semolina flour\n\n* Put the flours on a pastry board making a hole in the center where you will put 4 whole eggs and 25 gr extra virgin olive oil.\n* With a fork amalgamate the eggs and let the flour be incorporated, salt the dough and continue this operation until it will be possible to work it by hand.\n* work the dough until it is smooth and even. Leave it to rest in a film in the fridge for 30 minutes at least.\n* work the dough with a rolling pin and divide in several part\n* now with the help of a pasta machine begin to lower the thickness of the dough\n* the dough will be ready when it is less of one millimetre thick. I usually use the lower setting of thickness\n* now cut the pasta dough to obtain squares 4 cm long, i use a pasta cutter to obtain several squares at the time and speed up the process\n* Take a pasta square and put a little of filling in the middle then fold the square into a triangle. Finally, roll up the triangle and join the angles creating the typical shape of the tortellini like you can see in the video\n* if the pasta dries too much you can moisten the edges of the dough square with a finger wetted in a little water. this will help to seal the tortellini.\n* Put the tortellini on a tray lined with parchment paper. If you want you can also frozen tortellini, to do so put the tray in freezer a few hours, in this way they will remain intact and will not stick during freezing, when the tortellini are well frozen you can transfer them in bags to save space in the freezer\n* Cook tortellini into boiling beef and poultry stock. If frozen, do not unfreeze.\n* You can also prepare tortellini without broth. Cook them in abundant salted water, when they are ready ( 4/5 minutes usually) drain them and season with a heavy cream sauce with ham and peas.

Add the onion and cook for 5-6 minutes until just beginning to soften.\n* Add the garlic, capers, and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\nDeglaze the Pan:\n\n* Add the white wine and chicken stock and bring to a boil.\n\nSimmer the Sauce:\n\n* Add the cherry tomatoes to the sauce and bring to a boil. Taste and season lightly with salt and pepper. The capers and chicken stock will lend a lot of salt to this recipe, so be careful with salting too heavily. Reduce heat and simmer as you prepare the rest of the meal.\n\nBoil the Pasta:\n\n* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the rigatoni and cook for about 2-3 minutes under al dente.\n\nFinish the Sauce:\n\n* Pour the heavy cream into the sauce. Scoop out 1/3 cup pasta water from the rigatoni and add it to the sauce. Using a spider strainer, add the slightly undercooked rigatoni directly to the sauce. Bring to a very gentle bubble \u2013 not boiling, but slightly above a simmer. And cook for 5-7 minutes more until the sauce is very thick and the pasta is tender. Stir in the lemon juice and minced parsley. Taste and season again to your preference.\n\nSear the Scallops:\n\n* Pat the scallops dry. Season lightly with salt and pepper and pat dry again.\n* Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Melt the butter into the skillet. Once melted and frothy, add the scallops, without overcrowding the pan, and cook for 1-2 minutes until very well seared. Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes more until the scallops are opaque and cooked through.\n* Turn off the heat on the scallops and immediately transfer the scallops on top of the pasta in the skillet. Turn off the heat.\n\nTo Serve:\n\n* Divide the pasta and scallops between shallow bowls. Garnish with more minced parsley, if desired.

Using a spice grinder (or similar) blitz your dried mushrooms into a very fine powder. Here I\u2019m using black trumpets but you could easily substitute with any other edible wild mushroom.\n\n2. Mix together the mushroom powder and flour into a bowl, and dump out onto your clean work surface.\n\n3. Use your hand to form a well (like a volcano) in the center of the flour.\n\n4. Carefully pour your eggs into the center and begin slowly mixing together with a fork. Gradually, carefully, work your way all around to incorporate the eggs with the flour, without breaking the outer wall.\n\n5. After about 5 - 10 minutes it will start coming together into a shaggy mass. Begin using your hands to knead the dough together. Work diligently for another 5 minutes until it is no longer shaggy.\n\n6. Use the edges of your hands, knuckles, to work the dough until it starts to form a smooth ball. Roll it, applying pressure, into the work surface. Fold it. Roll it again. After about ten minutes it should be a smooth, and ready to rest.\n\n7. Cut the dough into two and wrap each in plastic wrap. Set into the fridge for at least 30 minutes.\n\n8. The following steps revolve around using a pasta attachment on a Kitchenaid - but you could also do this by hand with a rolling pin. Remove one of the dough balls, unwrap, and cut off a portion of the dough. Lightly flour and cover the rest back with plastic. Press gently and form a rectangle.\n\n9. Pass the dough through the sheet pasta attachment at it\u2019s widest setting. If it feels sticky, add a little more flour. Gradually tighten the settings of the pasta attachment, one click at a time, and pass the pasta sheet through until it is light and delicate. For tagliatelle, I normally go to the 6th setting.\n\n10. Allow the sheet of dough (sfoglia) to dry for 2-3 minutes and fold in half. With a knife, trim off irregular edges. Gently fold the dough into about 3 inch folds, over and over until you have a nice compact roll.\n\n11. Using your knife, carefully begin cutting strips of the roll into about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) pieces. With your fingers, unroll each strip and sprinkle with a light coating of semolina. You can make little nests with each batch that is finished. Repeat until all of your dough has transformed unto tagliatelle.\n\n12. Cook right away of store in the fridge covered with a towel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Video of the process here.](https://youtu.be/4SgGcPvvX0E)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cacio e pepe**\n\nIngredients\n\n1 1/2 cups freshly grated Pecorino Romano\n\n1 1/2 tsp. of freshly ground black pepper\n\n3 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil\n\nSalt\n\n1.5 cups pasta water\n\nDirections\n\n1. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add a dash of salt.\n\n2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and add in crushed black pepper. Stir until the pepper becomes very fragrant. Turn off the heat.\n\n3. Boil the fresh pasta.\n\n4. Reserve about 1.5 cups of pasta water as the pasta finishes. The starch from the water is why you wouldn\u2019t just use regular water here.\n\n5. Transfer the cooked pasta into the skillet with pepper and oil. Toss until all of the noodles are coated.\n\n6. Add about a cup of pasta water to the noodles and stir. This may feel like a lot but it will all come together when you\u2026\n\n7. Add all of the freshly grated Pecorino to the pasta, and stir very well until the cheese and water form a luxurious creamy coating all over the noodles. Add more pasta water as necessary.\n\n8. Divide the pasta into individual plates and sprinkle on a little more fresh Pecorino.

Add the meatballs in an even layer and cook without moving for 3\u20134 minutes per side until browned all over. Depending on the size of your pot, you may need to cook them in batches. Transfer the meatballs to a plate. They need not be cooked through at this stage.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. If the pot is dry, add another teaspoon or two of oil and turn the heat to medium heat. Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and diced onion and cook for 10 minutes until softened. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.\n2. Pour in the water or broth and scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and add the tomatoes and salt and a pinch of sugar. Bring the tomatoes to a boil and add the meatballs. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.\n3. Remove the lid and check the temperature of the meatballs. Once they reach 165\u00baF, transfer them to a plate and scatter 5 fresh basil leaves on top of the meatballs along with a pinch more Parmesan cheese.\n\n**Finish the sauce:**\n\n1. Tear the remaining basil leaves and add them to the sauce with the cooked pasta and toss to coat. Taste and season.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Serve the sauced pasta at the table with the platter of turkey meatballs.

I made a few modifications to the filling based on ingredients I had readily available, but the filling is fantastic, with or without mushrooms.\n\nYou can also use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store - just make sure you finely chop it.\n\n**Roast duck:**\n\n* 4\u20135\u00a0pound\u00a0duck; giblets, neck, and feet reserved for another use\n* 1 orange, quartered\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Filling:**\n\n* 2-inch\u00a0piece of ginger, peeled and minced\n* 4\u00a0cloves\u00a0garlic, peeled and minced\n* 3\u00a0scallions, trimmed and minced\n* 2\u00a0Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced\n* 2\u00a0tablespoons hoisin sauce\n* 2\u00a0tablespoons thin\u00a0soy sauce\n* 1\u20132 tablespoons sweet chili sauce, optional, to taste\n* \u00bd orange, juiced\n* Salt, if needed\n\n**Dumplings:**\n\n* 24\u201328 dumpling wrappers\n* Sliced scallion greens, optional, for garnish\n* Water\n\n**Sauce:**\n\n* \u2153 cup black vinegar\n* 1\u20132 teaspoons chili oil\n* 1 teaspoon sesame oil\n* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds\n\n**Prepare the duck:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF.\n2. Line a roasting pan with foil. Place a raised rack in the pan and set aside.\n3. Pat the duck dry and season it all over with salt and pepper.\n4. Stuff the cavity with the orange wedges. Truss the legs with kitchen twine.\n\n**Roast the duck:**\n\n1. Place the duck on top of the raised rack and transfer it to the oven for 2 hours.\n2. Remove the duck from the oven. Using a sharp knife, create a few shallow slits in the skin across the breast and around the thighs. This will allow the fat to fully render. Be careful not to cut the meat too much. You just need 6\u20138 slits all over the duck, particularly around the fatty area of the legs and breasts.\n3. Return the duck to the oven for 1 hour.\n4. Remove the duck from the oven and let cool as you prepare the filling.\n\n**Prepare the filling:**\n\n1. Gather the minced ginger, garlic, scallions, and Thai chili peppers in a bowl. Add the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, orange juice, and sweet chili sauce if you like.\n\n**Shred the duck:**\n\n1. Once the duck is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones. Avoid any meat that feels very sinewy. You can keep as much of the crispy skin as you like for the dumplings, particularly the skin around the breasts, thighs, and legs. I discard the skin on the back of the duck. Reserve the carcass for stock, if you like.\n2. Place the meat and skin on a cutting board and finely dice. Transfer to the bowl of aromatics and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Your filling is finished, and you're ready to make dumplings!\n\n**Fold the dumplings:**\n\n1. First, get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation.\n2. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the dumpling wrapper.\n3. Wet the edges with water and fold the dumpling in half. Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling closed into a half-moon shape.\n4. You can crimp and pinch the edges as you seal it, but it takes practice!\n\n**Steam, pan-fry, or deep fry the dumplings:**\n\n1. To steam: fill your steamer pot with water and place the rack on top. Place a liner on top. Bring the water to a boil and arrange the dumplings on top. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and steam for 10 minutes.\n2. To pan-fry: Dip the bottoms of the dumplings into the water just to coat the bottom, then dip into a bowl of sesame seeds to evenly coat the bottom. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high. Add the dumplings, sesame seed side down, and cook without moving for 1 minute. Pour in \u00bc cup water and cover immediately. Cook for 3\u20134 minutes. Remove the lid and fry for an additional minute or so.\n3. To deep-fry: Heat a few inches of oil in a large pot until the oil reaches 330\u00baF. Add dumplings in batches and deep-fry for 3\u20134 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Make the sauce by whisking together the black vinegar, chili oil, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. Place the sauce in a small bowl in the middle of a serving platter. Arrange the dumplings around the sauce and garnish with sliced scallions.

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the pearl onions (skins on) and boil for 5 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl of ice-cold water using a slotted spoon.\n2. Once the onions are cool enough to handle, carefully cut off the root end of the onion with sharp scissors. Pop the onion out from its skin. Continue on until all the onions are peeled. Discard the skins.\n\nCook the sweet potatoes:\n\n1. Dump out the water from the pot and add the sweet potatoes. Cover with fresh water and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20 minutes until fork-tender.\n2. Turn off the heat. Pour the potatoes into a colander and return the pot to the same burner. Allow the potatoes to dry off for 1 minute using the residual heat from the warm burner.\n3. Add the butter, milk, sour cream, garlic powder, and pepper flakes to the potatoes.\n4. Using an immersion blender, blend until creamy and smooth, adding more milk if needed. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder or pepper flakes. Set aside and keep warm.\n\nCook the duck:\n\n1. Pat the duck dry breast dry. Using a sharp paring knife, score the skin at an angle in \u215b-inch increments until the skin has been completely scored from edge to edge. Be careful not to pierce or cut into the flesh of the duck.\n2. Place the duck, skin-side down, into a skillet. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 7 minutes or until the fat begins to render out. Adjust the heat periodically as it cooks. You want to stay somewhere between medium and medium-low.\n3. If your duck breast is unevenly fatty (for example, the ends may have a thicker fat layer than the middle of the breast), use a small cast-iron press or skillet or a metal flipper to press that part of the duck into the skillet to encourage even browning.\n4. After 7 minutes, get the heat back to medium or just slightly above. The fat in the skillet may begin bubbling and sputtering a bit more rapidly. Check the skin and continue frying and adjusting the heat until the skin is deep golden brown and crisp. This may take another 6\u20138 minutes. Just keep adjusting the heat and peeking at the skin.\n5. Flip the duck and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until desired internal temperature is met. For medium-rare, cook the duck to about 130\u00baF at the thickest part of the breast. Note: Do not take the temperature of the duck through the skin. Pierce the flesh in order to get an accurate temperature read. I prefer to cook the duck until it reaches 135\u00baF.\n6. Transfer the duck to a plate and cover it tightly with foil. Set aside to rest as you finish the rest of the recipe.\n\nFry the mushrooms and onions:\n\n1. Drain all the duck fat into a heat-proof jar through a small sieve. Wipe out the skillet and place it on the stove over medium heat.\n2. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes until the mushrooms begin to sweat and take on a bit of color.\n3. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved duck fat, pearl onions, and thyme sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes until the pearl onions are fork-tender and golden around the edges.\n4. Stir in the minced garlic and fresh parsley and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute. Turn off the heat.\n\nTo serve:\n\n1. Right before serving, remove the foil from the duck and slice it crosswise.\n2. Spoon the sweet potatoes into a rimmed plate and pile on the mushrooms and onions. Arrange a few slices of duck on each plate. Garnish with more parsley and Aleppo pepper flakes if you like.

You can also use cashews or almonds.\n\nDon't overcook the vegetables - To retain their texture and nutrients, don't overcook the vegetables. Add them towards the end of cooking and cook just until they're tender.\n\nAdjust the seasoning - Taste the curry as you cook it and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may need to add more salt, sugar, or fish sauce to balance the flavours.", "created_utc": 1678472479000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "mienczaczek", "url": "https://i.redd.it/im7yhtuueyma1.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11nwlxk/chicken_massaman_curry/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11nwlxk/chicken_massaman_curry/", "bbcgf_title": "Beef massaman curry", "calories": 734.0, "salt": 1.87, "fat": 46.0, "sugars": 13.0, "saturates": 21.0, "carbs": 38.0, "protein": 44.0, "fibre": 3.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9}, {"id": "11g7ybp", "title": "Spicy Orange Chicken and Mushrooms", "score": 1690, "num_comments": 47, "ingredient_comment": "**More photos, tips, and substitutions can be found here:** [**Spicy Orange Chicken Recipe**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/spicy-orange-chicken-recipe/)\n\n**Sauce:**\n\n* 4 ounces fresh squeezed orange juice\n* 2 teaspoons orange zest\n* 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine\n* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n* 4 tablespoons light brown sugar\n* 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n* 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n* 1 tablespoon chili oil, optional\n* 1 tablespoon cornstarch\n\n**Chicken:**\n\n* 2\u20133 tablespoons neutral oil\n* 1\u00bd pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized cubes\n* 3 tablespoons cornstarch\n* \u00be teaspoon salt\n* \u00bc teaspoon white pepper\n\n**Aromatics:**\n\n* 2 teaspoons neutral oil, as needed, divided\n* 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, caps sliced and stems discarded\n* 2 teaspoons freshly minced ginger\n* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 2\u20133 bird\u2019s eye chilies, trimmed and minced\n* 2 scallions, minced\n\n**For serving:**\n\n* Sliced scallion greens, crispy shallots, or sesame seeds\n* Cooked white rice\n\n**Prepare all the ingredients:**\n\n1.

I made this recipe with him in mind :)\n\n* Prep Time: 20 minutes\n* Cook Time: 35 minutes\n* Inactive time: 1 hour\n* Total Time: 1 hour 50 minutes\n* Servings: 6\n* Calories: 451kcal\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 3 carrots, peeled and diced\n* 8 ounces button mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced\n* 3 tablespoons butter\n* 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 1 teaspoon dry thyme\n* 1 teaspoon dry oregano\n* \u00bd teaspoon crushed red pepper\n* 10-ounce jar roasted red peppers, drained and sliced\n* 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n* \u00bd cup red wine\n* 14.5- ounce can cherry or whole peeled tomatoes\n* 28- ounce can crushed tomatoes\n* \u00bd cup chicken stock or water\n* Pinch of sugar, optional\n* 6- ounce jar pitted Castelvetrano olives, drained and torn in half\n* 8-ounce ball fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced into rounds\n* Extra virgin olive oil\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* For serving:\n* Cooked pappardelle pasta\n* Minced parsley\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**Fry the chicken:**\n\n1. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Heat the 1 tablespoon of neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the chicken thighs, in batches if needed, skin-side down. Cook without moving for 5 minutes or until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the bottom of the pot. Flip and cook for 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Keep the pot on medium-high heat.\n\n**Cook the aromatics:**\n\n1. Add the diced onion, carrots, and sliced mushrooms to the pot. Cook, stirring regularly, for 8\u201310 minutes. Season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Melt the butter into the pot and add the garlic, dry thyme, dry oregano, and crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the red bell peppers and cook for 1 minute.\n\n**Brown the tomato paste:**\n\n1. Add the tomato paste to the pot. Cook, stirring and mashing the paste into the pot, for 3\u20134 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium as needed to prevent it from burning. The paste will sizzle, deepen in color, and stick to the bottom of the pot.\n2. Pour the wine into the pot and bring it to a boil. Stir to lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot.\n\n**Simmer the sauce:**\n\n1. Add both cans of tomatoes along with the chicken stock or water. Add a pinch of sugar if you like. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, taste the sauce, and add a pinch of salt and pepper if needed. Add the chicken to the pot, spooning the sauce so that it completely covers the chicken.\n2. Cover the pot and simmer on low heat for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to ensure that the sauce isn't sticking.\n3. After 30 minutes, remove the lid and add the torn olives, stirring them into the sauce. Cover and simmer for an additional 10\u201320 minutes.\n\n**Finish the chicken cacciatore:**\n\n1. Turn on the broiler. Remove the lid from the pot. Arrange the sliced mozzarella on top and drizzle with a teaspoon or two of extra virgin olive oil. Transfer to the broiler for 2\u20134 minutes or until the cheese is browned and bubbly. Turn off the broiler and remove the pot from the oven.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Sprinkle the chicken and sauce with freshly minced parsley. Serve with pasta or crusty bread.

However, this does add more time to the recipe. If you\u2019re in a pinch and you have leftover shredded chicken already, you can skip the steps for making the stock and move right into the sauce preparation.\n\n**What you need:**\n\nFor this recipe, you\u2019ll primarily need chicken, pasta, vegetables, and heavy cream. Take a look at some of my substitution suggestions so you can modify this dish any way you like:\n\n* **Chicken:** Omit for vegetarian. You could also use shrimp but you would skip baking the dish to avoid overcooking them.\n* **Brussels sprouts:** Use your favorite vegetables in this meal! Try it with zucchini, broccoli or broccolini, cauliflower florets, eggplant, or use spinach.\n* **Roasted red bell peppers:** Chopped sun-dried tomatoes\n\nPrep Time: 15 minutes\n\nCook Time: 30 minutes\n\nInactive Time: 1 hour\n\nTotal Time: 1 hour 45 minutes \n\nServings: 6 \n\nCalories: 762kcal\n\n### Equipment\n\n* Large pot\n* Baking sheet\n* Wide ovenproof pot\n* Sieve\n* Tongs\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Chicken stock (optional):\n\n* 1 pound bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts\n* 1 yellow onion quartered, paper left on\n* 1 head of garlic halved, paper left on\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n#### Creamy chicken pasta:\n\n* 16 ounces pasta of your choice like strozzapreti, rigatoni, penne, rotini, or fusilli\n* 2 tablespoons neutral oil\n* 2 red bell peppers trimmed, seeded, and quartered\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 1 pound Brussels sprouts halved\n* 4 tablespoons butter\n* 1 teaspoon dry thyme\n* \u00bd teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more if desired\n* \u2153 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1\u00bd cups homemade chicken stock from above or use store-bought stock\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Freshly minced parsley optional, for garnish\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Prepare the stock:\n\n* Cover split chicken breasts with water and season liberally with salt. Add the quartered onion and halved head of garlic. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 30\u201340 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Skim off the foam that floats to the top as the chicken cooks.\n* Use tongs to transfer the chicken to a plate and let it cool. Bring the stock back to a boil and boil for 15 minutes until significantly reduced. Strain through a sieve into a large bowl and set aside. You will need 1\u00bd cups stock for the recipe, and any extra stock can be saved for another use.\n* Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred it with your fingers, two forks, or dice it up. Discard the skin and bones.\n* Wipe out the pot used for the stock and fill it back up with salted water and return it to the stovetop. You'll use it for the pasta later on.\n\n#### Broil the red bell peppers:\n\n* While the stock cooks, prepare the red bell peppers. Arrange the prepared peppers on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Place under a broiler and cook for 7\u20138 minutes until blackened all over. Keep an eye on them, so they don't burn to a crisp!\n* Immediately transfer the peppers to a Tupperware dish with a lid or a gallon freezer bag. The trapped steam will help the skins come off easily. Peel the peppers and roughly chop and set aside.\n* Turn the broiler off and turn the oven's heat to 400\u00baF.\n\n#### Cook the pasta:\n\n* Bring the pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until 2 minutes under al dente. Drain and set aside.\n\n#### Cook the vegetables:\n\n* In a wide, oven-proof pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Cook the onion until softened\u2013about 7\u201310 minutes\u2013and then turn the heat to high. Add the Brussels sprouts and cook for 6 minutes until well-charred. Add the chopped red peppers and cook for 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl.\n\n#### Prepare the sauce:\n\n* Melt the butter in the pot over medium heat. Once bubbly, add dry thyme and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add flour to the butter and cook for 2\u20133 minutes until lightly golden. Slowly whisk in the reserved chicken stock. Bring to a low boil and then reduce heat and continue whisking until completely smooth.\n* Stir in the heavy cream and whisk until smooth. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and more crushed red pepper if you like. Turn off the heat.\n\n#### Bake the pasta:\n\n* To the sauce, add the cooked chicken, cooked pasta, and the reserved vegetables and toss to coat and evenly distribute the ingredients. Sprinkle the parmesan cheese on top and transfer to the oven for 10\u201315 minutes or until the Brussels sprouts are fork-tender and the cheese is melted. If you like, broil for 2\u20133 minutes to char the top of the pasta.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Garnish the pasta with fresh minced parsley and serve immediately.

Just taste and add \u00bd cup of water at a time as necessary!*\n\n#### Cook the noodles:\n\n* Taste the broth and adjust the seasonings as necessary. Bring to a boil. Add the noodles and cook for 8\u201312 minutes or until just al dente.\n\n#### Finish the chicken noodle soup:\n\n* Once the noodles are tender, reduce heat and add the white pepper, dill, parsley, and lemon juice. Cook an additional 5 minutes. Once the herbs are bright green and the noodles are tender, turn off the heat.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with crusty bread.

Enjoy cooking!\r  \n\r  \nThe secret of the best Chicken Tandoori is the meat quality and marinating time.\r  \n\r  \nThe longer marinating period the better. It gives the meat enough time to absorb all those beautiful flavours!\r  \n\r  \nRemember to always pick the meat from suppliers that do respect animal welfare, if you cannot afford it try to eat less meat but better sourced.\r  \n\r  \nMaking cuts in the meat helps the marinade to penetrate deeper, thus giving a better result.\r  \n\r  \nServes 3 hungry heads\r  \n\r  \n\n\n**Ingredients for Chicken Tandoori:**\r  \n\r  \n3 good quality chicken legs\r  \n\r  \n3 tbsp of natural yoghurt\r  \n\r  \n1/2tsp of salt\r  \n\r  \nhalf lemon juice and zest\r  \n\r  \n3tsp of garlic and ginger paste\r  \n\r  \n2tbsp of Kashmiri mild chilli powder (if you are not a big fan of spicy food substitute with 2tbsp of paprika)\r  \n\r  \n1tsp of turmeric\r  \n\r  \n1/2tsp ground coriander\r  \n\r  \n1tbsp oil\r  \n\r  \n\n\n**Instructions for Chicken Tandoori:**\r  \n\r  \n1.Prepare the chicken by removing the skin and separating the drumstick from the thigh.

Prepare chicken breast\n\nPaper dry chicken breast and slice horizontally from the thicker side to a thinner, but stop about 1/2 inches to it. This way you will \"butterfly\" your chicken breast, which is a well-known technique to make thin and large chicken pieces. \n\nCover your butterflied chicken breast with a piece of plastic wrap and roll a pin over it to make it even and thinner. Set aside.\n\n2.  Make mushroom stuffing \n\nMince 5 cloves of garlic and saut\u00e9 it in a frying pan over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add finely chopped 2 onions, keep saut\u00e9ing for another 2 minutes. Add chopped Portobello mushroom caps to the pan and keep cooking stirring occasionally for 5 more minutes or until all water will evaporate from the pan. \n\nAdd a quarter of a cup of dry White Wine, mix well and cook until stuffing gets almost dry. \n\nAt that point add 1 teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, and some fresh minced thyme. Mix well and set aside to cool down.\n\n3. Roll!\n\nPlace your chicken with a wide side down and thin side up like on the pictures below. \nDivide mushroom sauce into 3 parts: 2 for each chicken breast and 1 for the cream sauce for later. \n\nUsing a spoon, evenly spread 1 part of mushroom stuffing over the chicken piece, leaving half an inch on each side uncovered. \n\nNext, lay some thinly sliced fresh mozzarella, keep sides uncovered.\n\nGently roll chicken working your way from the wider bottom to the thinner top. Do not add too much pressure, as your stuffing will try to escape! We will secure everything in place with a cooking twine in just a second.\n\nNow it is time to wrap our roulade in prosciutto. Here is what I learned the hard way ( meaning one of the roulades on final pictures is an unsuccessful test, but still the same delicious ha!): lay prosciutto slices parallel to your chicken roll, this way it is much easier to cover the whole roulade, which will look so much better when the dish is done!\n\nTwine up! Using a cooking twine (the cotton string will work just fine!) gently wrap your roulade, starting from one side of it with tying a knot and work your way to the other side. Now you can add some pressure to help twine keep roulade`s shape while searing it. \n\n4. Sear roulade \n\nPreheat your skillet pan on medium heat. I used skillet mostly because I  wanted to be able to cook my dish both on a stovetop and in the oven, so if you have a suitable frying pan you can stick it into your cooking stove, - use that! Also, I used 2 tablespoons of canola oil to season my pan. \n\nAdd your chicken roulades into a hot pan and sear for 3 minutes on each of 4 sides.  Let it cool down for 5 minutes before proceeding to the final step.\n\n5. Sauce and bake\n\nGently remove twine by cutting each layer and pulling it.\n\nFinally, pour half a cup of heavy cream into your pan, add a third of the mushroom stuffing left from making roulades, and a little bit more cheese ( at this point you can use any cheese you love but make sure it is great melting one). \n\nPlace pan into the preheated to 370F oven and bake for 20 minutes. \nTo add some amazing color broil on High for just a minute before taking it out of the oven.", "created_utc": 1620825365000, "upvote_ratio": 0.990234375, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "Intelligentblond", "url": "https://i.redd.it/dsewyouqloy61.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/nan8ux/prosciuttowrapped_chicken_roulade_with_mushrooms/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/nan8ux/prosciuttowrapped_chicken_roulade_with_mushrooms/", "bbcgf_title": "Prosciutto-wrapped chicken & leek terrine", "calories": 322.0, "salt": 1.09, "fat": 17.0, "sugars": 2.0, "saturates": 5.0, "carbs": 4.0, "protein": 39.0, "fibre": 2.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.92}, {"id": "n1ncb8", "title": "Thai basil stir fry", "score": 1946, "num_comments": 61, "ingredient_comment": "Thai basil stir fry recipe:\n\n*Serves ~6 people*\n\n*I eyeballed the ingredient amounts but will try and write approximations.*\n\nIngredients:\n\n* ~2.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs\n* ~20 cloves of garlic finely chopped, ground, or minced\n* 5-6 stalks worth of basil leaves (use holy basil or regular basil here)\n* 1-2 heads of broccoli\n* 1 yellow onion\n* 1 red bell pepper\n\n* Oyster sauce (~10 tbsp for marinade and another 4 tbsp for stir fry sauce)\n* 2 tbsp Hoisin sauce\n* 1 tsp Fish sauce\n* 1.5 tbsp Light soy sauce\n* 1.5 tbsp Dark/sweet soy sauce\n* A few pinches of corn starch\n* A few pinches of MSG if you have it although I forgot it this time and still tasted great\n* 1 tbsp sugar (also optional - the sauces already add some sweetness)\n\nProcedure:\n\nSlice the chicken into strips and then marinate in plenty of oyster sauce for at least 30 min to an hour but the longer the better.

Applying heat from the bottom and the top will create puffed pitta, watch it closely not to burn it, this takes around **3,5 minutes**. (Do one at the time, and you may need to heat up your baking surface again before doing another one).\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Insight:**\n\n* I also like gyros chicken just with gherkin salad.\n* If your pitta is not puffed, increase temperature or try to heat the oven for a longer time or roll pittas slightly thicker. You may also need to reheat the stone/cast iron between each pitta.\n\nBlog post with Pitta video recipe: [https://www.insightflavour.com/post/chicken-gyros-kebab](https://www.insightflavour.com/post/chicken-gyros-kebab)", "created_utc": 1611748758000, "upvote_ratio": 0.990234375, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "mienczaczek", "url": "https://i.redd.it/a0alp17y6vd61.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/l630lj/chicken_gyros_kebab_with_crunchy_gherkin_salad/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/l630lj/chicken_gyros_kebab_with_crunchy_gherkin_salad/", "bbcgf_title": "Spiced chicken kebabs with chopped salad & flatbreads", "calories": 516.0, "salt": 1.09, "fat": 20.0, "sugars": 6.0, "saturates": 7.0, "carbs": 42.0, "protein": 41.0, "fibre": 5.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.98}, {"id": "l2cl8g", "title": "Mediterranean Chicken Recipe, an Healthy and Tasty Way to Make Chicken", "score": 25, "num_comments": 1, "ingredient_comment": "This recipe is an healthy and tasty way to cook chicken, an explosion of classic Mediterranean flavors!!

Bring to a boil and cook for 25 minutes until very soft. Drain into a colander and transfer to a large bowl.\n* Add the ricotta, milk, butter, nutmeg, and white pepper to the bowl and use a hand mixer or potato masher to blend until smooth and creamy. If desired, add a few splashes more of milk until desired consistency is reached. Taste and season with salt. Add more nutmeg or white pepper to taste, as desired. Keep the potatoes warm as you prepare the rest of the meal.\n\n#### Start the Duck:\n\n* Place the duck breasts, skin-side down, in a skillet (ensuring that there is enough room for both of them without them touching each other). Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for 10-15 minutes until the skin is very deep, golden brown and the fat has rendered out. As you cook the duck skin, use a spoon to remove some of the duck fat and transfer to a heat-proof bowl.\n* Flip the duck breasts and cook an additional 7-10 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 140\u00baF when inserted at the thickest part of the duck breast. Transfer to a wooden cutting board and cover with foil. Rest for 10 minutes before slicing.\n\n#### Prepare the Lingonberry Sauce:\n\n* While the duck is cooking, prepare the lingonberry sauce. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and two teaspoons of the reserved duck fat in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 2-3 minutes until softened.\n* Add the lingonberry jam, lemon juice, \u00bc water, and sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes until thickened. Once thickened and reduced, turn off the heat. Mount the butter into the sauce and stir until emulsified and glossy. Set aside.\n\n#### Cook the Arugula:\n\n* Immediately after the lingonberry sauce is cooked, prepare the arugula. Remove all but a tablespoon or two of duck fat from the skillet and transfer to the heatproof bowl.\n* Turn the skillet to medium heat and add the sliced shallot. Cook for 2 minutes until softened.\n* Add the arugula and cook for 3-4 minutes until mostly wilted. Turn off the heat and allow the residual heat to cook the arugula the rest of the way.

Welp, Vietnamese people eat FAR more than just pho or banh mi, and at home, food is oftentimes far simpler and humbler, like this simple preparation of Vietnamese garlicky roast chicken. \n\n  \nRoast chicken has thousands of iterations across cultures, but this is one of my absolute favorites, and it\u2019s sooo simple: it\u2019s got just six ingredients plus the chicken, and after 30 minutes roasting in the oven, you\u2019ve got a lip-smackingly luscious bird that will beg to have its juices sopped up with some rice!\n\n  \nTo watch my video on how to make this:\u00a0[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90)  \n**Viet Garlicky Roast Chicken Recipe (adapted from Andrea Nguyen)**\u00a0\n\n  \n1 whole 3.5-4 lb chicken, preferably\u00a0organic and air-chilled,\u00a0spatchcocked (back bone removed with bird splayed flat), OR 3.5-4 lb chicken parts (thighs,\u00a0drumsticks, and wings)\u00a0\n\n  \n*Marinade ingredients:*\n\n* 4\u00a0whole garlic cloves,\u00a0minced finely\u00a0\n* 1 tsp black pepper\n* 1.5 tsp sugar\n* 1/4 tsp kosher salt\n* 1.5 Tbsp\u00a0neutral oil\n* 3.5 Tbsp Maggi seasoning\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Combine all sauce\u00a0ingredients into a bowl and mix well.\u00a0\n2. Prepare\u00a0the chicken: take the chicken (or chicken parts), and using a chopstick or skewer, carefully\u00a0separate the skin from the meat all over. Then, add the marinade sauce all\u00a0over\u00a0the chicken with your hands, making sure to get the sauce\u00a0between the meat\u00a0and the skin.\u00a0\n3. Refrigerate the chicken\u00a0and\u00a0allow to marinade for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor\u00a0penetration.\u00a0\n4. The next day, preheat oven to 500 F. Place spatchcocked\u00a0chicken on a cast iron roasting pan or roasting tray.\u00a0Place\u00a0chicken in the oven and roast for about 30 minutes, checking about 5-10\u00a0min in to ensure the chicken isn\u2019t browning too quickly. If it is, tent the darker parts with foil and lower heat to 450 F. If using parts, roast time may be closer to 40-45 min.\u00a0\n5. After about 30 minutes, remove chicken from the oven. Check doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer - thighs should register about 165 F when done.\u00a0\n6.

Place mixture in fridge for at least an hour.\n4. On a clean work surface, place a piece of plastic wrap down that is roughly twice the size of the tenderloin.\n5. Place a layer of Prosciutto down, enough to cover the tenderloin.  Spread the duxelles in a thin layer across the prosciutto.\n6. Place the tenderloin at the bottom of the duxelles and use the plastic to carefully roll the tenderloin up, tucking the ends as you go.  Make sure to roll tight and to use the plastic to hold the shape.  Place in the fridge for at least 20 minutes.\n7. Spread some flour on the work surface and un fold the puff pastry sheet, lightly tossing to get the flour on both sides.\n8. Place a sheet of plastic wrap across the face of the puff pastry, with about an inch of overlap. Flip overs so the pastry is on top and the plastic is on the bottom.\n9. Place the unwrapped tenderloin carefully into the bottom middle edge of the pastry.  Spread egg wash on the uncovered portion of the pastry, and carefully roll the tenderloin into the pastry, tucking the ends as you go.  Roll tightly in the plastic, and place in fridge for at least 20 minutes.\n10. Preheat the oven to 425.  Remove the plastic, and cover the entire surface of the pastry with egg wash.

The colder months are upon us, and in England, there\u2019s no heartier dish for the evening than Steak and Ale Pie with Guinness. This versatile recipe is expertly balanced to mitigate the bitterness of the stout, earning it the title of Best Ale Beef Pie. Additionally, I\u2019ve included methods for preparing it solely as a stew or using a slow cooker for added convenience. Lets get cooking!\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n\\* 1.1 lbs Beef stewing steak - (500g) diced\n\n\\* 3 Onions, medium size - peeled and diced\n\n\\* 2 Carrots, medium size - peeled and diced\n\n\\* 1 Celery stalk - fine dice\n\n\\* 6 Garlic cloves - sliced\n\n\\* 1.1 lbs Potatoes - (500g) large dice\n\n\\* 1 can Guinness - (440ml) or other ale or stout\n\n\\* 1.7 cups Beef stock - (400ml)\n\n\\* 2 tbsp Tomato paste\n\n\\* 1 tbsp Fresh thyme\n\n\\* 1 tsp Black pepper\n\n\\* 2 tbsp Vegetable oil\n\n\\* 2 tbsp All-purpose flour\n\n\\* 1 sheet Ready-rolled puff pastry\n\n\\* 1 Egg - beaten (for glazing)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**1.** In a large pot or deep skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Toss the beef cubes in flour, shaking off the excess, and brown them in the hot oil. Remove and set aside.\n\n**2.** In the same pot, add a bit more oil if needed and saut\u00e9 the onions, carrots, and celery until softened. Add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes.\n\n**3.** Pour in the Guinness and beef stock, then add the tomato paste. Stir well, ensuring all the brown bits from the bottom of the pot are incorporated.\n\n**4.** Add the browned beef back into the pot, season with salt and pepper, and stir. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 1 hour.\n\n**5.** After 1 hour of simmering, add the diced potatoes into the pot and continue simmering for another 30 minutes to 1 hour, or until the beef is tender and the sauce has thickened.\n\n**6.** Preheat your oven to 356\u2109 (180\u00b0C) in preparation for baking the pie.\n\n**7.** Once the filling is ready, if you prefer a thicker sauce, you can thicken it further using a gravy mix or a slurry of flour and water. Stir until the desired consistency is achieved. Transfer the thickened filling to a pie dish. Roll out the puff pastry and place it over the top of the filling, crimping the edges. Make a small slit in the centre for steam to escape. Brush the top with the beaten egg for a golden finish.\n\n**8.** Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.\n\n**9.** Allow the pie to rest for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy with a side salad or additional vegetables if desired :)\n\nBlog post/print version: [Steak and Ale Pie - Chefs Binge](https://chefsbinge.com/steak-and-ale-pie-guinness/)", "created_utc": 1698418340000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9399414062, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "mienczaczek", "url": "https://i.redd.it/rgwfxy9z2rwb1.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17ho1lc/steak_and_ale_pie_guinness/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17ho1lc/steak_and_ale_pie_guinness/", "bbcgf_title": "Steak, ale & mushroom pie", "calories": 1244.0, "salt": 2.61, "fat": 70.0, "sugars": 15.0, "saturates": 29.0, "carbs": 105.0, "protein": 54.0, "fibre": 7.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.96}, {"id": "1794rgh", "title": "Youvarlakia Lemon Greek Meatball Soup", "score": 79, "num_comments": 8, "ingredient_comment": "You can make the recipe [HERE](https://dobbernationloves.com/food-drink/lemon-greek-meatball-soup-giouvarlakia-youvarlakia-recipe/).  \n**Ingredients** \n\n**Meatballs**  \n\t\u2022\t500 g Minced Beef  \n\t\u2022\t1/4 cup Long Grain Rice  \n\t\u2022\t1/2 cup Dill  \n\t\u2022\t1 Small Spanish Onion finely chopped  \n\t\u2022\t2 Garlic Cloves minced  \n\t\u2022\t1 Egg  \n\t\u2022\t2 tbsp Olive Oil  \n\t\u2022\t1 tsp Kosher Salt  \n\t\u2022\t1/2 tsp Black Pepper  \n\t\u2022\t3.5 cups Chicken Stock  \n**Avgolemono Egg Lemon Sauce**  \n\t\u2022\t2 Eggs  \n\t\u2022\t2 Lemons juice and zest  \n\t\u2022\t1 tbsp Dill chopped  \n\t\u2022\t1 tsp Cornstarch  \n**Instructions**  \n\t1.\tPlace all the meatball ingredients into a large bowl.

Add the flour, black pepper, salt, and paprika to a large bowl and stir to combine.\n2. Blot off any excess liquid from the beef. Add it to the bowl with the flour and toss to coat.\n\n**Brown the beef:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the beef in an even layer. Do not overcrowd the pot; you will likely need to brown the beef in batches. Cook for 3\u20135 minutes on each side until browned all over. Transfer to a large bowl and keep the pot on medium-high heat. Add more oil, as needed, while browning the beef.\n\n**Cook the mushrooms:**\n\n1. Add the sliced mushrooms to the pot. Cook, turning occasionally, for 7\u20138 minutes until lightly browned. Continue cooking for an additional 2\u20133 minutes until deep golden brown. Season lightly with salt and transfer to the bowl with the beef.\n\n**Saut\u00e9 the mirepoix:**\n\n1. If the pot is dry, add another drizzle of neutral oil. Turn the heat to medium and add the onion, celery, and carrots. Season all over with salt and pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, for 7\u20138 minutes until the onions are translucent and the carrots begin to brown around the edges.\n2. Melt the butter in the pot and add the garlic and thyme. Toss to coat and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n**Simmer the stew:**\n\n1. Sprinkle the flour over the aromatics and toss to coat. Cook for 1\u20132 minutes until nutty and aromatic. Add \u00bd cup of the water or beef stock and whisk to form a slurry. Continue adding the liquid, in \u00bd-cup increments until all 4 cups of liquid have been incorporated.\u00a0\n2. Return the beef and mushrooms to the pot. Add the remaining 1\u20132 cups liquid if needed to ensure the beef is completely submerged with liquid. Taste and season the broth with more salt and pepper, if needed. *Note: You may need to add more liquid as the beef cooks. You can use additional beef stock or continue adding water if the broth of the stew evaporates too quickly.*\n3. Reduce the heat on the beef stew to low. Cover and simmer and 1\u00bd hours. Check the stew occasionally and add more liquid as needed.\n\n**Finish the stew:**\n\n1. Uncover the stew and simmer for an additional 15\u201320 minutes, uncovered. Taste and season once more to your preferences.\n2. Add the frozen peas and cook for 5 minutes until warmed through and bright green. Turn off the heat.\n\n**Prepare the noodles:**\n\n1. As the stew finishes simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse and set aside. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.\n2. Turn the heat to medium and add the butter. Whisk often for 5\u20137 minutes until it turns golden brown and takes on a nutty aroma. As soon as the butter browns, add the garlic and parsley and turn off the heat. Stir constantly off the heat for at least 30 seconds to cook the garlic and prevent the butter from burning.\n3. Once the butter is nice and fragrant and garlicky, add the cooked noodles and toss to coat. Add salt and pepper to taste. If your noodles are cold, you can return the pot to the stovetop and warm them up over gentle heat right before serving.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1.

Prepare the Madras spice blend by mixing the ingredients. It will make more than you need for the recipe (you can always add more at the end of cooking to boost the flavour)\n2. Place the beef in the bowl and marinate by mixing all the ingredients from the list with the meat. Place in the fridge overnight.\n3. On the following day, sear the beef in a frying pan over high heat and transfer it to a slow-cooker or a pot (do not over-fry it as it will make your meat dry, you want a nice caramelization on one side of each piece) Add enough hot water to cover the meat and cook covered on low until tender.

Once the beef is tender and connective tissue has turned into jelly, separate it from the liquid. Add beef to the sauce plus a little bit of the cooking stock.\n8. Continue cooking on low heat until the thick consistency of the sauce is reached.\n9. Serve Beef Madras with fresh coriander seeds and leaves. Crunch with papadam, cucumber raita and onion salad. Enjoy!\n\n**Insight:**\n\n\\- The slow cooker's low setting is approximately 90C (194F). A high setting brings the cooking temperature to around 100C (212F).\n\n\\- Collagen - connective tissue in the meat begins to dissolve into gelatin at a temperature of 70C (160F). Lower cooking temperatures and longer time result in a juicer and tenderer meat.\n\nBlog post: https://www.insightflavour.com/post/beef-madras-with-coriander-papadam", "created_utc": 1656846609000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9599609375, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "mienczaczek", "url": "https://i.redd.it/9rmv99fcvb991.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/vqedgc/beef_madras_curry/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/vqedgc/beef_madras_curry/", "bbcgf_title": "Beef curry", "calories": 337.0, "salt": 0.31, "fat": 19.0, "sugars": 8.0, "saturates": 6.0, "carbs": 11.0, "protein": 29.0, "fibre": 3.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.96}, {"id": "s8ro6h", "title": "Beef teriyaki noodles with bok choy and shiitake mushrooms", "score": 2576, "num_comments": 28, "ingredient_comment": "**Ingredients\u2060**\n\n* 1 Bok choy\n* 200gr shitake mushrooms\n* 200gr bean sprouts (tauge)\n* 2 red onions\n* \u20605 spring onions\n* \u20603 garlic cloves\n* A few thyme twigs\n* Teriyaki sauce\n* Noodles\n* Fried onions\n* Sirloin steak\n* Butter\n* \u2060Salt\n* Pepper\n* Chili flakes\n\n\\`This was for 2 people.\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1.

Slice the mushrooms and roughly chop the onion, too\n2. Over high heat, sprinkle half a tablespoon of vegetable oil into your pan, which should preferably be NOT non-stick, to better sear the meat. Once the pan is really hot, season your meat with salt and pepper and immediately transfer into the pan. DON'T overcrowd the pan and fry stripes for 30-45 seconds. Quickly turn once browned and sear from other side for another 30-45 seconds and set aside on a plate\n3.

NOTE: If you got a good, rather tender cut, you don't need to and shouldn't cook the meat in the gravy anymore, for it will overcook and get tough.

Place fennel seeds and caraway seeds in a small skillet, crushing the seeds between your fingers as you sprinkle them in. Add a pinch of flaky sea salt. Turn the heat to medium and toast for 45 seconds. Add the golden beets, mustard, shallot, and Serrano pepper and cook for 3\u20134 minutes, turning occasionally, until they begin to warm through completely.\n2. Pour in the orange juice, vinegar, maple syrup, and 1/3 cup water. Season with salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low and simmer for 30\u201345 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the relish becomes jammy and sticky. Add more water as needed to loosen up the relish as needed. Taste and season once more.\n\n**Cook the bacon:**\n\n1. Place the diced bacon in a wide pot over medium heat. Cook, turning often until the fat completely renders from the bacon and the bacon crisps up. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour all but 1 tablespoon of rendered bacon fat into a heat-proof glass.\n\n**Brown the pork chops:**\n\n1. Pat the pork chops dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Add 1 tablespoon neutral oil to the 1 tablespoon bacon fat in the pot. Add the pork chops and cook without moving for 3\u20135 minutes per side until browned. Brown the fat caps for 1\u20132 minutes and then transfer the pork chops to a baking sheet. Transfer to the oven for 15\u201320 minutes or until the pork chops reach desired internal temperature, 135\u00baF\u2013140\u00baF is ideal for medium-rare as the chop will rest up to 145\u00baF.\n3. Remove the pork chops from the oven and tent them with foil.\n\n**Prepare the cabbage:**\n\n1. Drain and discard the oil in the pot. Heat up 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat. Once hot, add the diced cabbage and season all over with salt and pepper to taste. Add the sugar, orange juice, distilled white vinegar, and mustard. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is tender, 15\u201320 minutes. Stir all but a pinch of the cooked bacon into the cabbage. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the braised cabbage between plates and place a pork chop on top. Spoon the golden beet relish on top of each chop. Sprinkle the rest of the crispy bacon on top of each dish. Serve alongside roasted potatoes if you like.

Mix the warm milk with the yeast from the banh bao package. Let it sit and work its magic for 10 minutes. If you are using a stand mixer you can add these ingredients to the mixer bowl.\n2. Once the yeast has worked its magic add oil and vinegar and add the mixer attachment. In a medium-sized bowl mix the dry ingredients together, the flour, sugar and salt.\n3. Swap the attachment to the dough hook and add the dry ingredients and mix on low first and gradually increase the speed to medium-low. I let it work the dough until it's well mixed. Roughly 2 minutes. Avoid over-kneading in the mixer to create a light and fluffy bao.\n4. Add a small pinch of flour to a clean surface. Take the dough out of the bowl and use your hands to knead the dough using the palm of your hands. Continues until the dough is nice and smooth. Let it sit for 1 hour to allow it to rise. Best to place it somewhere warm.\n\n**Prepare the pork filling, quail eggs and Chinese sausage**\n\n1. Boil the quail eggs until they are cooked and peel. Set aside.\n2. Take 2 sausages and slice them at an angle to get a nice oval-shaped sausage. I cut them roughly 1/8 inch. Set aside.\n3. Take the ground pork, add the wood ear mushrooms, onion, sesame oil, fish sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, salt and black pepper. Mix it well and set aside to marinade for about 10 minutes.\n4. Portion out 12 pork fillings and roll them into a ball and set aside.\n\n**Assembling the bao**\n\n1. Once the dough has doubled in size take the dough and divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Use a scale to portion out evenly.\n2. Using a rolling pin to roll out a circle roughly 3.5-4 inches wide. Place the pork filling, quail egg and 2-3 slices of Chinese sausage in the center.\n3. Two ways to pleat the bao:\n\n***Method 1 (more work but looks cute)***\n\n1. Using your primary hand form a small fold with your thumb and index finger. Hold the fold and using your opposite hand place your thumb underneath and your index finger on top and push the dough towards the fold to form the second pleat. You are looking to make an accordion fold. Continue forming these pleats while at the same time rotating the bao until you reach the end.\n2. There will likely be a hole at the top. Using both hands gently close the hole by squeezing it close.\n3. Give it a gentle twirl and that\u2019s it!\n4. Place on top of parchment paper square.\n\n***Method 2 (quick and easy but not as pretty)***\n\n1. Grab the opposite ends and bring the dough together over the filling.\n2. On the opposite sides that bring the other sides over. It\u2019s like wrapping the filling up\n3. Using both hands seal the center, making sure there are no openings.\n4. Place the bao on top of parchment paper square .\n\n**Steaming**\n\n1. Prepare the steamer by adding water and \u00bd cup white vinegar. Make sure to add enough water to steam multiple batches if your steamer is smaller. I steam in 2 batches.\n2. Once the water is boiling turn the heat to medium-high and add the baos. Steam for 20 minutes per batch.\n\n**Note:** Using premix Banh Bao flour yields fluffy bao. I also have a homemade dough recipe which can be found on the link above if you are not able to find the premix flour in the store.", "created_utc": 1668986494000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9702148438, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "CookwithChung", "url": "https://i.redd.it/nj59muorv61a1.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z0ip7d/vietnamese_steamed_pork_buns_banh_bao/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z0ip7d/vietnamese_steamed_pork_buns_banh_bao/", "bbcgf_title": "Spicy pork bao buns", "calories": 160.0, "salt": 0.5, "fat": 3.0, "sugars": 6.0, "saturates": 1.0, "carbs": 23.0, "protein": 8.0, "fibre": 1.0, "bbcgf_ratings": null}, {"id": "yswx49", "title": "Asian Pork Riblets", "score": 54, "num_comments": 1, "ingredient_comment": "**Recipe:** [https://cookwithchung.com/asian-pork-riblets/](https://cookwithchung.com/asian-pork-riblets/)\n\nPrep time: 20 minutes\n\nCook time: 40 minutes\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 3 lbs pork riblets\n* 4 garlic cloves chopped finely\n* 2 shallot chopped finely\n* 1 tbsp oil\n* 1 tbsp soy sauce\n* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce\n* \u00bc cup brown sugar\n* 1 tbsp sesame oil\n* 2 tbsp rice vinegar\n* 1 tbsp of Chinese cooking wine\n* 2 tbsp water\n* Garnish\n* Green onions, chopped\n* Sesame seeds\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1.

I used Stove Top pork)- Freshly ground Pepper\n\n\\- 2 tsp fresh thyme\n\n\\- 1 tsp parsley flakes\n\n\\- 1 tsp sage\n\n\\- 2 small shallots, very finely chopped\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the scotch eggs:\n\n\\- 6 medium eggs\n\n\\- 80g plain flower, seasoned with salt and pepper\n\n\\- 1 egg beaten\n\n\\- 3 slices of white bread, lightly toasted then ground into breadcrumbs\n\n\\- vegetable oil, for frying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Method**\n\n\\- Combine all the ingredients for the sausage meat together in a medium bowl, mix thoroughly. Meat can be covered and stored in fridge for later use.\n\n\\- Place the eggs, unbroken, in cold salted water. Bring to the boil then immediately reduce tempreature and simmer for 9 min. (You may have to do this in stages, if so you only need to let the water cool to warm between batches)\n\n\\- When the eggs are finished strain and cool under running water. Then peel off the shells, if you haven't done this before I recommend looking up a video, fingernails help.\n\n\\- Take the sausage meet and divide into sixths on a clean cutting board, before flattening each into a shallow oval \\~1/4\" thick.\n\n\\- Spread the seasoned flower onto a large plate. One at a time take a peeled egg and dredge it in flower until a thin coating sticks to all surfaces, before placing the egg at the center of the flattened sausage meat, and wrapping the meat around it and gently rolling to form a smooth egg shaped ball.\n\n\\- Prepare the breadcrumbs, I used a stick blender and a tall cup to get them fine enough. Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate. One at a time coat the meat wrapped eggs in the beaten egg mixture before rolling in bread crumbs enough to ensure a even coating on all surfaces.\n\n\\- With all the eggs prepared select a high walled pot and fill with oil, quantity will vary based on pot selection but ideally should be enough to completely submerge the prepared egg. **Important:** Do not fill the pot anywhere near to full, remember when you place eggs in the oil level will rise and we do not want it to boil over. Heat the oil until a loose breadcrumb placed in it will bubble and brown in around 30s. (I found this was around 370F)\n\n\\- The eggs will be cooked for \\~9 min in the hot oil. I suggest using a slotted spoon to place and remove them. I encourage you to monitor the oil tempreature yourself, either by thermometer or look and feel and suggest you open up the first egg cooked and determine if any adjustments need to be made. It will all be relative to your setup but I cooked the eggs two at a time on alternating cycles, one egg removed every four and a half minutes, my oil temperature remained fairly constant at \\~320F, and I rotated the eggs twice to ensure even cooking.\n\n\\- **Important:** Usual safety precautions when working with hot oil apply, always use long implements to place eggs into the oil preferably from the side of the pot. Be aware of the temperament of the oil, sizzling is good bubbling is worrying. Be aware of the level of the oil as you add and remove the eggs. Finally as I was working in a small pot I took the step of turning off the gas every time I added a egg to prevent risk of flare up if the oil overflowed.\n\n\\- When the eggs are finished place them on a sheet of kitchen roll to absorb excess oil. Personal preference is to serve chilled or at room temperature, though they can be eaten warm after allowing some time to cool.  \n\n\n  \n**Improvements**  \nThis is probably the simplest least creative recipe for scotch eggs out there, I was deliberately aiming for generic. It does however make it completely open to adaptation/improvement. If I were to make it again I would definitely attempt to address the slightly bland breadcrumbs, I suspect the answer may be more salt but I also want to see if some herbs (perhaps sage) add some complexity to the flavor.", "created_utc": 1633417037000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9599609375, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "EminusVulneratis", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ziwqu8xymkr71.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/q1olns/scotch_eggs/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/q1olns/scotch_eggs/", "bbcgf_title": "Scotch eggs", "calories": 590.0, "salt": 2.49, "fat": 41.0, "sugars": 2.0, "saturates": 12.0, "carbs": 27.0, "protein": 30.0, "fibre": 1.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.9}, {"id": "nrt4c5", "title": "Char Siu Pulled Pork", "score": 25, "num_comments": 1, "ingredient_comment": "I made this pulled pork in the oven low and slow.

Pork meat is prepared by marinating in a unique spice blend called Red Recado and slow-cooked in fruit juices over a period of 21 hours.

Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks, for 10-12 minutes until well-browned and cooked-through. Season with extra crushed red pepper, if desired. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.\n* Drain off excess fat from the pot, reserving any fond stuck to the bottom of the pot.\n\n#### Cook the Leeks:\n\n* Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the pot. Once frothy, add the leeks and cook for 8-10 minutes until very soft. Season lightly with salt and pepper.\n\n#### Start the Rice:\n\n* Melt the remaining butter in the pot and add the rice.

Add the pork belly and parboil for a minute on each side, just until the exterior is a bit firm. Remove the pork belly to a cutting board, and set the hot water aside (don\u2019t pour it out!)\n* Add the garlic, ginger, star anise, Szechuan peppercorn, and cinnamon stick to the water and keep over low heat (we need this water to be hot since we will be adding it back to the pork and if it gets cold then it might cause the meat to toughen up)\n* Cut the pork belly into cubes about 1.5 inches on each side\n* In a Dutch oven or large pot, start heating up the oil over medium-low heat. Add 3.5 tablespoons of the brown sugar. Let the sugar sit undisturbed until you see it start to melt. Once it starts melting, you can use a single chopstick to mix it up a bit to speed up the melting process\n* When all the sugar has melted and turned into a dark amber color, add the pork belly. Cook while flipping the pieces for a few minutes until almost every side of each piece is covered with the caramel. Be gentle so you don\u2019t break the pieces!\n* Add the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine and cook for a minute. Then add the water with all the spices and aromatics. Braise the pork belly over medium-low heat for 2 hours, stirring once every 30 minutes\n* After 2 hours, the pork should be fully tender. You can check by sticking a chopstick into the meat through the bottom. The chopstick should be able to easily pierce the entire piece. If you want it to be more tender, put the lid back on and keep braising until it reaches your desired tenderness\n* Remove the lid and raise the heat to medium. Add the remaining 3.5 tablespoons of sugar and mix. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the sauce has reduced significantly and thickened up. Stir every few minutes to prevent the meat from burning. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s done when the sauce is thick enough to start sticking to the meat\n* Remove the meat from the pot and then drizzle with some of the extra sauce.

I did a little hunting and found a version on Cookpad by Kanya from Thailand which uses LOTS of cilantro. Kanya's version uses tofu, which I didn\u2019t have, so I omitted that.\n\nObviously, both versions are probably equally tasty, but I was definitely intrigued by the white pepper in the pork from Kanya's recipe, so that's what I used as my starting point.\n\nThis is a really easy recipe and a unique take on a really cheap veggie that most of us are probably swimming in this time of year!\n\n# SUBSTITUTIONS:\n\nGround Pork: Ground chicken or ground turkey\n\nCucumber: Seedless or seeded, doesn't matter\n\nGround White Pepper: Use black pepper instead \u2013 it won't have exactly the same flavor, but it's ok.\n\nYou can follow Kanya's method and add tofu to it, as well!\n\n# RECIPE\n\n## Equipment\n\n* Large pot\n\n## Ingredients\n\n## Pork Mixture\n\n* 1 pound ground pork\n* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* 3 tablespoons soy sauce\n* \u00bd tablespoon sesame oil\n* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste\n* 1 teaspoon ground white pepper\n* \u00bc cup fresh cilantro leaves and stems minced (see note)\n\n## Cucumber Soup:\n\n* 2 large cucumbers\n* 6 cups water or low-sodium chicken stock\n* 3 tablespoons soy sauce\n* \u00bd tablespoon sesame oil\n* 1 bunch cilantro stems minced (see note)\n* 1 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste\n* 1 scallion minced; white and green parts separated\n* Salt, to taste\n* Sesame seeds optional, for garnish\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Prepare the Broth:\n\n* Combine the water, soy sauce, sesame oil, minced cilantro stems, black pepper, sriracha, and white part of the scallion in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.\n\n## Prepare the Cucumbers:\n\n* Peel the cucumbers and cut into three or four pieces depending on the length. Using the back of a spoon, hallow out the seeds and discard them. Set aside.\n\n## Prepare the Pork Mixture:\n\n* In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the pork and mix until well-combined.\n\n## Stuff the Cucumbers:\n\n* Carefully stuff the cucumbers with the pork. Roll any remaining pork into small meatballs.\n\n## Boil the Cucumbers:\n\n* Turn the heat on the broth to a vigorous simmer. Carefully drop the cucumbers and meatballs into the soup and cook for about 15-20 minutes until the pork is completely cooked through and the cucumbers have softened. Turn off the heat.\n\n## To Serve:\n\n* Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with extra cilantro leaves, minced green part of the scallion, and sesame seeds.

Cut the cilantro right beneath where the bunch becomes leafy and mince the stems. Use about 1/4 cup of the leaves for the meatballs and use any remaining cilantro as garnish.

Add the shallot and cook for 3-4 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.\n\nCook the Tomatoes:\n\n* Add the chopped tomatoes and the cherry tomatoes and cook for 3-4 minutes more. Melt the butter into the pot. Once frothy, add the white wine and bring to a boil for 5 minutes to allow the wine to reduce slightly.\n\nSimmer the Broth:\n\n* Add the stock, starting with 2 cups. Season everything in the pot with salt, pepper, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes. Adding more stock, as necessary, if too much cooks off. There should be enough broth to coat about 1/4'' of the bottom of the pan, but it should not be soupy.\n\nCook the Risotto:\n\n* First, warm the chicken stock (either in a small saucepan on the stove or in a large glass measuring cup in the microwave).\n* Melt the butter into the large sauce pan over medium heat. Once melted, add the rice and cook, stirring regularly, until it begins to toast and turn golden brown, about 4-5 minutes.\n* Ladle 1-2 cups of the broth into the rice and stir regularly. Once the liquid is mostly absorbed (do not let the rice stick), add another 1-2 cups. Continue adding ladles of stock until all of the stock is mostly absorbed and the rice is tender but not mushy, about 16-20 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest for 5 minutes. Season with salt.\n\nCook the Shrimp:\n\n* As the risotto finishes cooking, add the shrimp to the broth and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-7 minutes until opaque and cooked through. Do not overcook. Turn off the heat and keep warm. Taste and season again to your preferences.\n\nTo Serve:\n\n* Add a few ladles of the spicy shrimp to the pot of risotto and stir gently to incorporate. Divide the risotto between plates and pile more spicy shrimp on top. Garnish with parsley and extra virgin olive oil, if desired.

Before beginning, prepare the leek as it takes the most time. Halve the leek lengthwise and very thinly slice both halves into 1/8-inch wide slivers. You may need to separate some of the layers of the leek and slice each layer separately. If you find bits of dirt deep within the leek, don\u2019t fret. You can place all the leek slivers in a sieve and rinse again once more to remove any stubborn flecks of dirt.\n2. Transfer the sliced leek to a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry to remove any excess water.\n\n**Steep the saffron:**\n\n1. Place the crushed saffron in a small bowl and cover it with 2 tablespoons of hot water. Set aside.\n\n**Prepare the guanciale chili oil:**\n\n1. Place the guanciale in a large pot (you\u2019ll use this pot later for the orzo and cod!) and turn the heat to medium. Cook, turning occasionally, for 8\u201310 minutes until the fat renders and the guanciale becomes crispy.\n2. Add the shallot, garlic, and crushed red pepper and cook for an additional 3 minutes, turning often and adjusting the heat as needed to prevent the garlic from browning. Once the shallot softens, and the garlic takes on a very light golden color, spoon the mixture into a bowl. Scoop out all but a tablespoon of the fat from the pot and add it to the bowl of guanciale.\n3. Pour the extra virgin olive oil, chili oil, and maple syrup over the guanciale. Stir vigorously to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add more maple syrup, chili oil, or crushed red pepper, depending on your preferences.\n4. The guanciale oil will keep in an airtight jar for up to 5 days.\n\n**Prepare the saffron cod and orzo:**\n\n1. Pat the cod dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Return the pot of remaining guanciale fat to medium heat. Add the sliced fennel bulb and stalks along with the sliced shallot. Season with salt and cook for 5\u20136 minutes until the fennel begins to soften.\n3. Add the garlic and cook for 1\u20132 minutes until just fragrant.\n4. Melt the butter into the pot and add the orzo. Stir to coat and cook for 1\u20132 minutes until it begins to lightly toast. Season with salt.\n5. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil for 2\u20133 minutes. Stir often to lift up any orzo that may have stuck to the bottom.\n6. Reduce heat to low and arrange the cod on top. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Drizzle the steeped saffron mixture all over, ensuring that each piece of cod gets a little bit of saffron water.\n7. Cover and simmer over low heat for 12\u201315 minutes or until the cod is opaque and the orzo is tender.\n\n**Frizzle the leek:**\n\n1. *Note: Use a saucepan that has somewhat high sides. Generally, you want a saucepan that\u2019s at least 6\u20138 inches deep. When you add the leeks to the hot oil, the oil will foam up vigorously, and you do NOT want it pouring over the edges.*\n2. As the cod simmers, make the leeks. In a saucepan, pour in 2 inches of vegetable oil. Turn the heat to medium-high. Break off a piece of leek and add it to the pot; if it bubbles rapidly, it\u2019s ready to fry.\n3. Working in small batches, add a handful of the leeks at a time to the oil. Stir occasionally and fry for 15\u201320 seconds until golden brown. Remove and\u2013using tongs\u2013transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Continue on until all the leeks are fried. Pat any excess oil off from the tops of the leeks with a paper towel and season with flaky sea salt. Set aside.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the cooked orzo into shallow bowls and place a piece of cod on top. Arrange the frizzled leeks next to the cod and drizzle with the guanciale chili oil. Sprinkle a few bits of fennel fronds on top if you remember (unlike me\u2026).

Place the cabbage, red onion, serrano pepper, and cilantro in a large bowl. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pour the lime juice on top.\n2. In a microwave-safe bowl, add the vinegar and sugar. Microwave for 1 minute until the sugar is dissolved. Let stand for 5\u201310 minutes.\n3. Add the mayonnaise and whisk until completely smooth.\n4. Pour the dressing over the cabbage and toss to combine. Taste and season to your preferences. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.\n\n**Prepare the jalape\u00f1o-avocado cream cheese:**\n\n1. Turn on your oven\u2019s broiler to high.\n2. Place the red onion and jalape\u00f1os in a small oven-proof skillet or baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil. Transfer to the oven under the broiler. Broil for 3\u20135 minutes (depending on the intensity of your broiler) until the peppers begin to blister and blacken. Remove and set aside.\n3. Combine the avocado, cilantro, lime juice, charred jalape\u00f1o, and red onion in a food processor. Place the cream cheese on top and pulse until completely smooth and creamy. Taste and season with salt. Pour into an airtight jar or a bowl and cover tightly with foil. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.\n\n**Make the cod:**\n\n1. Pour oil into a large pot, about 3 inches deep, and heat the oil to 350\u00ba\u2013375\u00baF. Note: If you don\u2019t have a deep fat thermometer, use an instant-read meat thermometer, provided the stem is long enough! You\u2019ll want to regularly check the oil\u2019s temperature and ensure you stay at a consistent 350\u00baF\u2013375\u00baF.\n2. Pat the cod pieces dry and season lightly with salt. Set aside.\n3. Combine the flour, chili powder, salt, baking powder, paprika, cayenne powder, and garlic powder in a bowl.\n4. Pour in the beer and whisk until completely smooth and free of lumps. The batter will be thicker than cream but still a tad runny.\n5. Place all of the cod pieces in the batter and toss to combine.\n6. Using tongs, lift a piece of cod from the batter and lightly shake off any drippy excess batter. Slowly drop it into the hot oil. Fry 4\u20136 pieces at a time, depending on the width of your pot. Be sure not to overcrowd the pot! Cook for 3\u20134 minutes until golden brown all over. Use a slotted spoon to transfer a paper towel-lined plate. Continue frying in batches, checking and adjusting the temperature periodically.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Arrange radishes, cucumber, red onion, cilantro, sliced jalape\u00f1o, and lime wedges on a serving platter.\n2. To assemble the tacos, smear a spoonful of the jalape\u00f1o-avocado cream cheese onto a warm tortilla. Place a few cod nuggets on top and finish with a spoonful of slaw. Sprinkle minced red onion and cilantro on top. Add one or two slices of jalape\u00f1o on top for extra heat, if you like. Serve cucumber, lime wedges, and radishes on the side. Enjoy!\n\n**Notes:**\n\nFor the recipe, you\u2019ll use cilantro in the slaw, cream cheese, and for serving. Buy just 1 nice-sized bunch and divide it into 3 for each component.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to buy just 1 red onion (use half of it for the slaw, and the remaining half is used for the cream cheese and for serving).\n\n**Nutrition:**\n\nCalories: 304kcal | Carbohydrates: 34g | Protein: 16g | Fat: 12g | Sodium: 351mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 5g | Vitamin C: 17mg", "created_utc": 1677000992000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "BushyEyes", "url": "https://i.redd.it/5eirtbh9vkja1.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/118b2wm/beerbattered_fish_tacos/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/118b2wm/beerbattered_fish_tacos/", "bbcgf_title": "Beer-battered fish tacos", "calories": 841.0, "salt": 1.8, "fat": 41.0, "sugars": 12.0, "saturates": 3.0, "carbs": 76.0, "protein": 34.0, "fibre": 8.0, "bbcgf_ratings": null}, {"id": "111e92a", "title": "Beetroot Cured Salmon", "score": 1025, "num_comments": 10, "ingredient_comment": "Originally posted here: [**Beetroot Cured Salmon** ](https://www.insightflavour.com/post/beetroot-cured-salmon-recipe)\n\n**Ingredients for Cured Salmon:**\n\n* 1kg (2.2pounds) side of salmon (trimmed and skin off)\n* 200g (7oz) of beetroot (peeled and diced)\n* 120g (4.2oz) of cooking salt\n* 70g (2.4oz) of sugar\n* 40ml (3tbsp) of vodka or gin\n* 2tsp of coriander seeds\n* 2tsp of peppercorns\n* 1tsp of juniper berries\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for the Fennel Slaw:**\n\n* 4 fennel bulbs (thinly sliced with a knife or mandolin)\n* 2 small red onion (thinly sliced)\n* 1 medium carrot (cut julienne or grated)\n* 150g (2.6oz) of mayonnaise\n* 4tsp of mustard (Dijon or English)\n* 2 lemon zest\n* 2 lemon juice\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nF**or Garnish:**\n\n* small bunch of fresh dill\n* 1tsp of nigella seeds\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to prepare Beetroot Cured Salmon:**\n\n**1.** To prepare the beetroot cure, blend beetroot, sugar, salt, vodka, and spices in a food processor for about 15 seconds.\n\n**2.** Next, find a container large enough to fit the salmon and line it with a double layer of cling film wrap.

If you would rather make this as a poke bowl, skip the sushi rice section and just use plain white rice. You can easily customize these with whatever extra toppings you like.\n\n**Original Recipe**: [https://craftycookbook.com/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls/](https://craftycookbook.com/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls/)\n\n**Time:** 50 mins\n\n**Servings:** 2 XL bowls (as pictured) or 3-4 smaller servings\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n*For Sushi Rice:*\n\n* 1 1/2 cups medium grain sushi rice\n* 1 3/4 cups warm water\n* 6 tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar *(This should have no calories. If it has calories, the vinegar is already seasoned with sugar and salt.)*\n* 2 tbsp white sugar\n* 1 1/2 tsp table salt\n\n*For Sesame Salmon:*\n\n* 6-10 oz sushi quality salmon (pictured is 5 oz per bowl)\\*\\*\n* 2 green onions\n* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil\n* 1 tbsp soy sauce\n* 1 tsp toasted white sesame seeds\n\n*To Finish Bowls:*\n\n* 1/2 medium-sized ripe avocado, optional\n* \\~1/2 cup shelled, frozen edamame, optional\n* \\~1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion, optional\n* \\~1/4 cup daikon sprouts, optional\n* other veggies such as carrots, cucumber, nori, bean sprouts, etc optional\n\n\\*\\*I purchase fish marked for sushi/sashimi from a Japanese grocery store, but this isn't the only option available.\n\n**To Prepare Sushi Rice:**\n\n1. The rice takes about 50 minutes to prepare, but has a lot of hands-off time. The salmon and veggies for this meal can be prepared as the rice cooks. Optionally, you can substitute plain white rice to make this recipe as a poke bowl instead.\n2. Place the rice in a large pot (that has a lid). Rinse and drain the rice until the water runs clear, at least 3 times (rinse the rice even if the bag says it's \"prewashed\"). Drain as much water as possible.\n3. Add 1 3/4 cup lukewarm water to the pot, close with the lid, and place on the stove top.\n4. Heat over medium-high heat until the water begins to boil, once boiling cook over medium-high heat for 4 minutes, then reduce heat to very-low and simmer for 15 minutes.\n5. After simmering, remove from heat and let the pot stand undisturbed for another 15 minutes.\n6. Scoop the rice into a large non-metallic bowl. Dust with sugar and salt, then pour over the rice vinegar. Using a rice spatula or non-stick spatula mix everything together and break up all the clumps of rice. Mix until every grain of rice is separated and coated in vinegar, the sugar and salt should dissolve completely. Don't worry if the rice seems too wet at this point, that will go away as it cools.\n7. Allow the rice to cool uncovered, mixing occasionally, until it reaches room temp (about 15 minutes). You can speed this process along by fanning the rice if desired. The rice should be slightly sticky once it's cooled.\n\n**To Prepare Veggies:**\n\n1. Boil the edamame per package instructions (typically 3-4 minutes), then drain and season lightly with salt.\n2. Peel the red onion and cut it in half, then slice as thin as possible until you have about 1/4 of a cup.\n3. Clip daikon sprouts from their base and thoroughly rinse.\n4. Prepare the avocado last, as it will brown if exposed to air for too long. Peel and thinly slice the 1/2 avocado as desired.\n\n**To Prepare Sesame Salmon:**\n\n1. Rinse the salmon thoroughly, then pat dry with paper towels. Using a very sharp chef's knife, slice the salmon into strips. Once in strips, slice again into cubes. You do not need a sushi knife, a sharp chef's knife will do. I make my cubes about 1/2 inch in size, but choose any size you prefer.\n2. Remove the root tip of the green onions and discard, then slice as thinly as possible (green and white portions). After slicing, use your hands to separate the rings of the white portion as much as possible.\n3. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the cubed salmon, green onion, sesame oil, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Mix until fully combined. *If not using immediately, cover and return to the fridge until ready to use.*\n\n**To Finish Bowls:**\n\n1. Divide the sushi rice evenly into the serving dishes, creating a wide, flat base.\n2. Spoon the salmon into the serving bowls, discarding any sauce that remains in the mixing bowl. \n3. Top with veggies as desired, then serve immediately with a spoon and chopsticks.\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear your feedback/suggestions/modifications in the comments section!**", "created_utc": 1672856231000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Meats", "author": "yellowjacquet", "url": "https://i.redd.it/015gmv1g04aa1.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/103an4j/sesame_salmon_sushi_bowls/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/103an4j/sesame_salmon_sushi_bowls/", "bbcgf_title": "Sesame & ginger sushi bowls", "calories": 449.0, "salt": 0.8, "fat": 21.0, "sugars": 6.0, "saturates": 4.0, "carbs": 44.0, "protein": 17.0, "fibre": 11.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.94}, {"id": "zz6xel", "title": "Easy Fish Stew Recipe", "score": 1407, "num_comments": 68, "ingredient_comment": "Recipe here originally: **[Easy Fish Stew Recipe](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/easy-fish-stew-recipe/)**\n\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 1 pound baby gold potatoes, quartered\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 1 tablespoon piment d'Espelette or use 2 teaspoons paprika and 1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n* 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n* 15- ounce can of chickpeas\n* 5 cups water or stock (chicken, vegetable, or seafood)\n* 1 pound white fish, such as tilapia, cod, or whiting\n* 6- ounce can pit green olives, halved\n* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil\n* Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste\n\n## For serving:\n\n* Minced fresh parsley or chives\n* Crusty bread\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Cook the onion and potatoes:\n\n\n1.

Once I started making lots of homemade soups I found that I couldn\u2019t go back to canned soup anymore, which was a bummer because I also didn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of getting and handling fresh clams to make clam chowder myself. \n\nThis recipe uses canned clams and it\u2019s the perfect middle ground in my opinion! Canned clams are an excellent source of iron, and they are cheap and last for a long time in the pantry! \n\n# Ingredients\n\n* 2  6.5 oz cans of clams\n* 1  8 oz bottle of clam stock (clam juice) \\*see note\n* 2 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled and cut into \\~1 cm cubes \\*see note\n* 4 strips of thick cut bacon (or 6 regular strips)\n* 1 large white onion, diced\n* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic\n* 2 cups whole milk (can sub non-dairy)\n* \u00bc cup all-purpose flour\n* \u2154 cup corn (from one cobb, or sub canned)\n* 1 tbsp fresh thyme\n* \u00bd cup shredded carrots (optional)\n* 1 bay leaf (optional)\n* Salt &amp; fresh cracked black pepper\n\n# Instructions\n\n1. Strain the clams over a measuring cup, reserving the liquid (should get about 1 cup total). Combined with the 8 oz bottle there will be 2 cups of clam stock, set this aside.\n2. Heat a large, wide pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Cut the bacon into bite-sized pieces and cook it until it reaches your desired level of doneness (I like to let some get crispy and pull some off a little sooner). Remove to a paper towel lined plate and leave the drippings in the pot. \n3. Add the onions to the pot and cook in the bacon drippings until they soften, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Add some extra olive oil if the bacon drippings don\u2019t coat the bottom of the pot)\n4. Add the potatoes, garlic, 1 tsp salt, and \u00bc tsp pepper to the pot. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently.\n5. Dust the flour evenly over the contents of the pot and cook, stirring frequently, for another \\~3 minutes.\n6. Add the milk and clam stock and stir until well-mixed. Add the bay leaf, thyme, carrots, and corn. Bring to a boil over high heat, and then reduce heat to medium-low to simmer until the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes (stirring occasionally to prevent potatoes from sticking to the pan's bottom). Add more salt and pepper to taste.\n7. Add the clams and bacon bits to the soup 2-3 minutes before serving. Remove the bay leaf and serve the soup topped with more thyme and fresh cracked black pepper.\n\n# Notes\n\n* Serve in bread bowls or alongside crusty bread for dipping.\n* Dicing the potatoes into small (\\~1 cm) chunks is critical to the texture of the soup, the outsides of the pieces dissolve and contribute to the creaminess of the soup. If cut too large this won't be as effective.\n* Clam stock (clam juice) can usually be found near the canned clams at the grocery store in 8 oz glass bottles.\n\nHope you guys like this one!

If you have ground cumin, you can add it later along with the other spices. Saut\u00e9 the cumin and coriander seeds for a minute or until they start releasing their aroma.\n\n**3.** Add the diced onions and carrots to the pan. Cook and stir them for about 5-6 minutes or until the onions become soft and translucent.\n\n**4.** Now, add the garlic ginger paste to the pan. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously, until the raw smell of garlic and ginger disappears.\n\n**5.** Mix in the turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and paprika (if using ground cumin, add it now). Stir everything together to coat the vegetables with the spices evenly.\n\n**6.** Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes or until the tomatoes become soft and start breaking down.\n\n**7.** Pour in the vegetable stock, and give the mixture a good stir. Bring it to a gentle boil.\n\n**8.** Lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pan, and let the curry base gravy cook for about 20-25 minutes. The vegetables should become tender, and the flavours will meld together.\n\n**9.** Once the vegetables are fully cooked, turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down slightly.\n\n**10.** Using a blender or an immersion blender, blend the mixture until you achieve a smooth and thick curry base gravy. If the consistency is too thick for your liking, you can add more vegetable stock to reach the desired thickness.\n\n**11.** Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt or spices if needed.\n\nYour curry base gravy is now ready to use! You can use it immediately in your favourite curry dishes or store it for later use. This flavourful base will enhance the taste of your curries, whether you're preparing vegetarian, chicken, lamb, or any other type of curry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to prepare Vegetable Balti:**\n\n**1.** Heat the ghee or vegetable oil in a Balti pan or a large wok over medium heat. Add the broken apart onions to the pan and stir-fry for a few minutes until they start to soften.\n\n**2.** Toss in the potatoes, green and red peppers, and continue stir-frying for a couple of minutes.\n\n**3.** Add the tomato wedges to the pan and saut\u00e9 briefly until they start to break down and release their juices.\n\n**4.** Incorporate the white cabbage, okra, frozen peas and cauliflower florets into the pan. Stir everything together to mix the vegetables evenly.\n\n**5.** Add the ginger garlic paste and continue to stir-fry for a minute or two, ensuring the vegetables are coated with the paste.\n\n**6.** Pour in the base curry gravy. Start with 2 ladles and adjust the quantity based on how saucy you want the Balti to be.\n\n**7.** Stir everything together and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the vegetables cook in the gravy for about 15-20 minutes or until they are fully cooked but still retain their texture.\n\n**8.** Check the seasoning and add salt or additional spices if needed.\n\n**9.** Stir in the yogurt and mix it well with the vegetables and gravy. This will add a creamy richness to the dish.\n\n**10.** If you're using vegetable oil, add a knob of butter at this stage to enhance the flavours of the Vegetable Balti.\n\n**11.** Once the vegetables are cooked to your liking and the flavours have melded together, turn off the heat. Your Vegetable Balti is now ready to be served! Transfer it to a serving dish, and you can garnish it with chopped fresh coriander leaves if desired. Enjoy this flavourful and aromatic dish with naan, rice, or any bread of your choice.

Make sure to press the tofu to remove excess water for best results. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 block extra firm tofu, 14 \u2013 16 oz, pressed to remove excess water\r\n* 10-12 oz broccoli florets, \\~4 cups\r\n* 3 green onions, greens sliced thin, or topping\r\n* \u00bc cup corn starch\r\n* roasted sesame seeds, optional, for topping\r\n* crushed red pepper flakes, optional, for topping\r\n* veggie oil\r\n\n*For Sauce:*\r\n\n* 2 navel oranges -  zest one orange, juice both oranges, or sub \u2154 cup orange juice\r\n* 3 tbsp honey, sub date syrup for vegan\r\n* \u00bc cup soy sauce\r\n* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic\r\n* \u00bd tbsp ginger paste or freshly grated ginger, or sub \u00bd tsp ground ginger\r\n* 2 tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar\r\n* 2 tbsp corn starch\r\n* sriracha sauce, optional, (for mild \u2013 \u00bd tbsp ; medium \u2013 1 tbsp ; hot \u2013 1.5+ tbsp)\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Cut the tofu into \\~\u00be\u201d cubes. In a large bowl, toss the cubes in the \u00bc cup of corn starch until they have an even, thick coating.\r\n2. Combine the soy sauce and 2 tbsp corn starch in a small saucepan and whisk until fully combined. Then add the rest of the sauce ingredients and mix well. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-low heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer until a thick sauce forms, about 5 minutes. Remove the completed sauce from heat. If you accidentally over-reduce the sauce, just add a splash of water and mix.\r\n3. As the sauce cooks, warm a generous swirl of veggie oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the tofu pieces and cook, turning occasionally, until they are golden and crispy on most sides, about 10 minutes. Remove to a large bowl.\r\n4. Add a little more oil to the pan if needed, and add the broccoli florets. Cook until they brighten in color and just begin to char, about 2 minutes.\r\n5. Pour the orange sauce over the tofu and toss to fully combine, then add the broccoli and toss further.\r\n6. Serve over a bed of rice (I use jasmine rice). Top with green onions and sesame seeds. Add crushed red pepper flakes for extra spice.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Pressing the tofu to remove excess water is very beneficial to the final texture, I strongly recommend pressing your tofu for at least 30 minutes before preparing the recipe. If you don\u2019t own a tofu press, wrap the block in paper towels, set it on a rimmed plate or tray, and place a heavy object on top of it.\r  \n\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear about how it went and any feedback/modifications if the comments section!**", "created_utc": 1675279843000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9599609375, "link_flair_text": "Fruit\\Vegetarian", "author": "yellowjacquet", "url": "https://i.redd.it/ko11xf737ofa1.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10r3nlp/crispy_orange_tofu/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10r3nlp/crispy_orange_tofu/", "bbcgf_title": "Crispy tofu", "calories": 165.0, "salt": 0.6, "fat": 10.0, "sugars": 0.0, "saturates": 1.0, "carbs": 11.0, "protein": 8.0, "fibre": 0.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.96}, {"id": "10aaxzc", "title": "Creamy Escarole and Bean Soup", "score": 77, "num_comments": 5, "ingredient_comment": "**Ingredients**\n\n* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil divided\n* 1 fennel bulb with stalks and fronds\n* 2 15- ounce cans of butter beans drained and rinsed\n* 1 head of escarole roughly chopped\n* 3 tablespoons tahini\n* 2 lemons divided\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Instructions**\n\n**Prepare the fennel:**\n\n1.

In this instance, I prepared a vegetarian version with roasted paneer cheese and vegetables. This sauce also works great with Chicken, Lamb and Beef. You can also use it as a dipping sauce for Naan bread or for other vegetarian alternatives like chickpeas or lentils. I hope you find this recipe useful, enjoy cooking!\n\nThis recipe makes 4 portions.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n\\* 200g of paneer cheese, cut into cubes\n\n\\* 2 medium onions, small dice\n\n\\* 1 medium carrot, fine dice\n\n\\* 4 garlic cloves, sliced\n\n\\* 4tbsp of veg oil or ghee\n\n\\* 500ml of veg stock\n\n\\* 1 can of coconut milk or coconut cream\n\n\\* 2 peppers, large dice\n\n\\* 1 red onion, cut into wedges\n\n\\* fresh coriander for garnish\n\n\\* salt\n\n**Korma Spice Blend:**\n\n\\* 1tbsp of ground cumin\n\n\\* 2tbsp of ground coriander\n\n\\* 2,5tbsp of ground turmeric\n\n\\* 1tbsp of garam masala\n\n**Garam Masala for Korma:**\n\nTo make the most delicious curry you can prepare your own Garam Masala. The secret is to ground the spices fresh, for this purpose, you can use an inexpensive electric grinder to do so. Below you can find a list of basic ingredients that make the most aromatic Garam Masala, if you don't want to go that far with your cooking you can purchase a ready-made blend.\n\n\\* 3cm of cinnamon\n\n\\* 1 star anise\n\n\\* 1tsp of black peppercorns\n\n\\* 1/2tsp of cloves\n\n\\* 10 green cardamom pods\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Set frying pan on medium heat, add 2tbsp of vegetable oil followed by diced onions, garlic and carrots, and cook until soft and glossy (10-15min) stirring occasionally.\n2. Add good pinch of salt and 3tbsp of  Korma spice blend, incorporate and cook on low for another minute or so to bloom the spices.\n3. Transfer everything from a frying pan to a medium-sized pot and add 500ml of vegetable stock. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer, place a cover on the pot and cook for around 10 minutes.\n4. In the meantime roast red onions, peppers and paneer cheese. To do so marinate them in 2 tbsp of vegetable oil, a little salt and 1tbsp Korma spice blend. Roast at 220C for around 15 minutes. To save energy I recommend using an air fryer instead of the oven.\n5. Now add coconut milk or cream to the pot and blend the sauce using an immersion blender. Once smooth, check the seasoning and add more salt if necessary, if you like your Korma more on the sweet side add honey instead.\n6. You can combine sauce with roasted vegetables and paneer cheese or serve them as garnish. Serve with rice or naan bread, and add fresh coriander.

On this occasion I prepared simple chilli sauce from my Indian friend's recipe, try it yourself and you will not regret it.\n\n**Ingredients for 15 Bhajis:**\n\n\\* 4 medium or 2 large white onions, cut in half and sliced\n\n\\* 1 green chilli, seeds removed and finely sliced\n\n\\* 1 medium potato, cut into fine matchsticks\n\n\\* 1tbsp of garlic and ginger paste\n\n\\* a handful of chopped fresh coriander\n\n\\* 1tsp of salt\n\n\\* 1tsp of mild chilli powder\n\n\\* 1tsp of ground coriander\n\n\\* 1tsp of turmeric\n\n\\* 1tsp of ground cumin\n\n\\* 1 large egg (you can skip for the vegan version, reduce the flour by 50g)\n\n\\* 150g (5.3oz) of gram flour (made of chickpeas)\n\n\\* 1L of vegetable oil for deep-fat frying\n\n**Ingredients for chilli sauce:**\n\n\\* 1 red chilli, seeds removed and sliced\n\n\\* 1 red bell pepper, diced\n\n\\* 1 garlic clove\n\n\\* juice of a half lemon\n\n\\* 50ml of water\n\n\\* 1/4tsp of salt\n\n\\* 1/4tsp of sugar\n\n\\* 1/4tsp of ground cumin\n\n**Instructions for Bhajis:**\n\n1. Preheat a deep fat fryer or a small pot with oil to 170C (340F) (you can check pot oil temperature with an electric probe)\n2. Mix sliced onions with potato matchsticks, green chilli, garlic ginger paste, fresh coriander, salt and spices. Do so until all onions are coated with colours.\n3. Mix in one egg to coat the onions then add chickpea flour, combine until no signs of dry flour is left.\n4. Use gloves for protection, take a small amount of Bhaji mix and shape in your hands into a ball (do not compress the mix) put it gently into the hot oil. Cook Bhajis until golden-brown then flip upside down for another minute or so to colour the topside. I recommend using a spider strainer or tongs to remove Bhajis from the oil. Place them onto a kitchen paper to drain excess fat.\n5. Do it in a few batches until all Bhajis are done, serve straight away or reheat in the oven later before serving.\n\n**Instructions for Chilli sauce:**\n\n1. Place all the ingredients in the bullet like this one and blend into a smooth chilli sauce.\n2. Transfer into a bowl to allow air bubbles to escape, then transfer into a serving dish.\n\nSmacznego!\n\nRecipe here originally: [Onion Bhajis](https://www.insightflavour.com/post/onion-bhajis)", "created_utc": 1643546349000, "upvote_ratio": 0.9799804688, "link_flair_text": "Fruit\\Vegetarian", "author": "mienczaczek", "url": "https://i.redd.it/xpcbah8jlte81.jpg", "comment_link": "https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/sg8cym/onion_bhajis_with_chilli_sauce/", "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/sg8cym/onion_bhajis_with_chilli_sauce/", "bbcgf_title": "Red onion & chilli bhajis with mint & garlic raita", "calories": 102.0, "salt": 0.09, "fat": 7.0, "sugars": 2.0, "saturates": 1.0, "carbs": 7.0, "protein": 3.0, "fibre": 1.0, "bbcgf_ratings": 0.96}, {"id": "s2lkm6", "title": "Vegetable Jelly", "score": 40, "num_comments": 40, "ingredient_comment": "Ingredients:\r\n\n* Asparagus\r\n* 30g carrots\r\n* 30g baby corn\r\n* 1/2 fresh shiitake mushroom\r\n* 30g broccoli\r\n* 120g konjac powder\r\n* Sugar, to taste\r\n* Honey, to taste\n\nDirections:\r  \n1.

The high humidity and cold temperatures of this season work in favour of mycelium, bringing us a vast variety of delicious mushrooms. On my short staycation in Lake District, I found a few beautiful Porcini mushrooms that you can see in the picture as well as multiple Larch Boletes referred to in my country as butter mushrooms. They have slimy caps and are perfect for sauces, soups or pickles. As the name suggests Larch Bolete can be found growing in symbiosis with Larch trees starting in July till November.\r  \n\r  \nThis is my family recipe for a delicious and filling mushroom soup, perfect after a fungi hunt.

Prep the pie crust at least 30 minutes in advance. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, celery seed, and salt. Add cold butter, and using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut the butter into the flour until there are only small, peas sizes pieces of butter visible in the flour. Next add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing with your hand or a spatula after each addition, until the dough begins to stick together. Using your hands, form the dough into a flat disk. Cover with plastic wrap, and chill at least 30 minutes.  \n2. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Toss asparagus with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper. Roast until slightly fork tender, about 10-15 minutes. Once the asparagus is out of the oven, raise the temp to 425\u00b0F.  \n3. Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat in a medium skillet. Add leeks and a pinch of salt, and saut\u00e9 until softened and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add frozen peas, and saut\u00e9 until thawed completely, another 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.  \n4. On a floured surface, roll out the dough until it's large enough to line a 9 inch round pie pan. Line pie pan with pie dough, prick bottom with a fork several times, then crumble half of the goat cheese and spread along bottom. Next add leeks and peas and spread evenly throughout the dish. Then crumble the rest of the goat cheese. Lastly arrange asparagus on top of the fillings.  \n5. Add eggs to a mixing bowl, and beat slightly. Then add heavy cream, 1 teaspoon salt, sugar, and cayenne and whisk to combine. Pour egg mixture evenly over other ingredients in the pie dish.  \n6. Bake at 425\u00b0F for 15 minutes. Then lower the temperature to 300\u00b0F and bake 35-40 minutes, or until set with just a slight wobble in the middle.  \n7.

Simply place your beetroots in a baking tray, cover with aluminum foil and place inside a pre heated oven on 180\\*C.\n\n2)Bake the beetroots until fork tender (piercing a fork inside without applying any pressure). Time may vary from 45 minutes to 2 hours.\n\n3)Once fork tender, peel the skin off, dice the beets roughly and blend with a stix mixer.  \nyour beatiful beetroot puree is now ready to use!\n\nFor the garnish:\n\n1)Place your cheese, olive oil and salt into a shallow mixing bowl and blend well with a stix mixer.\n\n2)Pass the creamy mixture through a fine sieve to assure a more stable texture.\n\n3)Mix well with the orange zest and set aside for further use.\n\nFor the risotto:\n\n1)Start by preparing the rice. Take a skillet or shallow pot and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your rice.\n\n2)Stir constantly for about 2-3 minutes until the edges of the grain start becoming translucent.\n\n3)Now that we build a protective layer around the grain, pour in your water and stir frequently until all the water has evaporated.\n\n4)Transfer the rice onto a tin, and let cool.\n\n5)Once cool, your rice is ready to use. This is a neat little step worth making when cooking risotto as it helps release more of that starchy goodness later on when cooking the risotto. Par-cooked rice like this can last up to a week in a food container in your fridge and will greatly shorten your time preparing risotto.\n\n6)Now take your skillet and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle over a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your diced onions.\n\n7)Saute the onions until soft and translucent.
