This recipe makes 10 Croquettes

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for 10 Pancakes:**

\* 2.5 cups All-purpose flour - (300g) Plain Flour

\* 1.7 cups Milk - (400ml)

\* 0.8 cups Water - (200ml)

\* 2 Eggs

\* 1 pinch Salt

\* Vegetable oil - for frying

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for the filling:**

\* 10.6 oz White mushrooms - (300g)

\* 3.5 oz Dried wild mushrooms - (100g) Porcini and Boletus

\* 1.7 lbs Sauerkraut with liquid - (800g)

\* 3 Onions, medium-size - diced

\* 3 Bay leaves

\* 5 All Spice Berries

\* 1 tsp Sugar

\* 1 tsp Vegeta seasoning - you can use salt instead

\* 2 tbsp Vegetable oil

\* Salt and Pepper to taste

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for panee:**

\* 2 Eggs

\* 2 cups Breadcrumbs - (200g)

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

1. **Cooking Sauerkraut:** Place sauerkraut with the juice in a pot and add enough water to cover it. Include bay leaves and allspice berries. Simmer on low heat until softened, approximately 3-4 hours. Add more liquid as necessary to keep the sauerkraut submerged.
2. **Preparing Mushrooms:** Place dried wild mushrooms in a glass jug or a small pot. Pour boiling water over them to cover. After 15 minutes, when they are soft, remove and chop them. Reserve the mushroom water for later use, being careful to avoid any sand at the bottom.
3. **Frying Onions and Mushrooms:** In a frying pan over medium heat, fry onions until they soften but do not brown, about 5 minutes. Then add sliced white mushrooms, increase the heat, and cook until the mushrooms start to brown. Season with Vegeta and black pepper to taste, then remove from the stove.
4. **Making Pancakes:** Blend all pancake ingredients until a smooth batter forms. Cook pancakes on a medium-sized non-stick frying pan. Pour a small amount of batter into the hot, oiled pan and spread it around by swirling. Once the pancake is set, remove it and place it on a plate. Repeat until all pancakes are made.
5. **Combining Filling Ingredients:** Once the cabbage is cooked, strain it from the liquid and remove the spices. Let it cool enough to handle, then chop finely. Mix with both the re-hydrated and fried mushrooms and onions. Season with sugar, black pepper, and salt to taste.
6. **Rolling Krokiety:** Spread about 2 tablespoons of filling inside each pancake. Fold the left and right sides inward, then roll up the pancake.
7. **Coating Krokiety:** Whisk 2 eggs in a bowl. Dip each krokiet in the egg, then coat with breadcrumbs. Prepared krokiety can be refrigerated for up to three days before frying if needed.
8. **Preparing for Frying:** Spread about 2 tablespoons of filling inside each pancake. Fold the left and right sides inward, then roll up the pancake.
9. **Frying Krokiety:** Shallow fry the krokiety in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry for about 3 minutes on each side, using enough oil to cook the sides of the krokiet.

Serve the krokiety with Polish beetroot soup (""Barszcz"") or enjoy them on their own. Smacznego!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1891x51/polish_krokiety_mushroom_sauerkraut_croquettes/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1891x51/polish_krokiety_mushroom_sauerkraut_croquettes/

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/quick-easy-nut-brittle/](https://maplewoodroad.com/quick-easy-nut-brittle/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 2 cups granulated sugar
* ½ cup water
* 6 Tablespoons butter
* ½ cup light corn syrup
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1-½ teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1-½ cups your favorite chopped nuts  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. In a pot on the stove, over medium to medium-high heat, bring the sugar, water, butter, and corn syrup to a boil until it turns an amber color and reaches 300℉ on a candy thermometer (the hard-crack stage). This will take approximately 10 minutes. During this time, DO NOT stir the mixture...we want to avoid crystallization and burning of the sugar. You also may have to make slight adjustments to the heat on your stove to get it to the correct temperature.
2. Once your mixture has reached the hard-crack stage (300℉ on a candy thermometer), remove the pot from the heat and immediately stir in the baking soda and vanilla extract. Be aware that it will bubble and foam up quite a bit as soon as you add the baking soda, so be ready!
3. Next, stir in the chopped nuts.
4. Finally, pour the finished nut brittle onto a parchment or silicone mat lined baking sheet and spread it out into a thin layer using a silicone spatula (or another spatula wiped down with a little bit of oil).
5. Let cool for 1 hour at room temperature.
6. After that hour, you can now reward yourself by using your hands to break the brittle into pieces and enjoying to your heart's content!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1866xrq/quick_easy_nut_brittle/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1866xrq/quick_easy_nut_brittle/

**Stock (optional to make; can use chicken broth instead):**

* 1 turkey carcass
* Water
* Salt

**Soup:**

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 carrots, peeled and diced
* 4 ribs celery, trimmed and diced
* 1 fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 5 sprigs thyme, bundled together with kitchen twine
* 6-7 cups prepared stock from above or use chicken broth
* 4 cups chopped or shredded leftover turkey; use in addition to any meat you pull off the turkey carcass
* ¾ cup pastina or ditalini
* 1 lemon, juiced
* ½ cup fresh parsley, minced
* Big pinch of fennel fronds, minced
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* Salt and pepper

**Make the stock:**

1. Place the turkey carcass in a large stockpot and cover with 12 cups water. You may need more depending on the size of the carcass. Try your best to immerse the bird with water, but if your pot isn’t big enough, it’s ok if the back bone sticks out a bit. Add a big pinch of salt to the water.
2. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 2-3 hours. You may wish to flip the bird once during simmering. The liquid should reduce by almost half.
3. Cover the pot (with foil, if the turkey is sticking out) and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.
4. The next day, remove the carcass from the stock. Pick off any remaining meat and set it aside in a bowl to be added to the soup. Discard the carcass.
5. If the stock is very gelatinous, place it on the heat over medium-high just until the gelatin melts, and the stock returns to a liquid. Turn off the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve.
6. Give the pot a quick rinse and wipe it out. Return it to the stovetop.

**Cook the soup aromatics:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for 8-10 minutes.
2. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the bundle of thyme.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Pour in the prepared stock and the chopped turkey. Add salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove and discard the thyme.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Return the soup to a boil. Add the pastina and cook for 3-4 minutes. Taste and add salt and pepper.
2. Finish the soup by adding parsley, fennel fronds, and lemon juice.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with lemon wedges and minced parsley on the side. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/183st4x/leftover_turkey_and_pastina_soup/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/183st4x/leftover_turkey_and_pastina_soup/

* 400 gram white rice (left-over or freshly cooked)
* 50 gram carrot
* 100 gram pointed cabbage
* 150 gram leek
* ½ tsp turmeric powder
* 2 tsp cumin powder
* 1 tsp cilantro powder
* 50 gram ginger (grated), or 1 tsp ginger powder
* 2 tbsp neutral oil
* 1 onion
* small bunch (10g) of celery leaf
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 3 tbsp Kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce)**optional:**
* 1 tbsp sambal to taste (Indonesian chilli sauce)
* 1 tsp trassi (fermented shrimp paste)**Condiments to serve:**
* Prawn crackers
* Atjar tjampoer (mixed pickled vegetable)
* Sambal (Indonesian chilli sauce)
* 4 eggs, sunny side up 
* Sliced cucumber 

**Directions:**

1. Cook your rice a minute shorter than what the packaging states. If using freshly cooked rice, spread it out on a tray to cool slightly. If you are using leftover rice - that's even better - break up any clumps.
2. Cut the leek in half and slice into rings of 1 cm. Dice the carrot, and cut the pointed cabbage and onion. If you use other vegetables, or left-over vegetables, cut them in bite-sized pieces as well. You can basically use any vegetable you like.
3. Gather the spices: turmeric, ginger, cilantro, cumin, garlic. Chop the shrimp paste, this is optionally. And grab your sambal.
4. Heat a large pan or wok over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of neutral oil and sauté the onion until fragrant and translucent.
5. Turn your wok down to low heat. Add the spices, the shrimp paste and the sambal to the wok. If using sambal, adjust the amount according to your desired level of spiciness. Wok for 3 minutes.
6. Add the vegetables to the wok. Heat your wok over medium heat. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened.
7. Add 1/3 of the cooked rice to the wok. And then add the kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce). Use a spatula to break up any clumps and mix the rice with the vegetables and spices.
8. Add the other 2/3 of the cooked rice and the chopped celery leaves. Continue stir-frying the rice for about 5 more minutes until all the rice has turned brown and yellowish. Optionally you can now make a sunny side up egg in another pan. I really like a sunny side up egg as a condiment to this nasi goreng recipe. 
9. Remove your nasi goreng from heat and serve on the plate with condiments such as: prawn crackers, store-bought atjar tjampoer (mixed pickled vegetables), sambal (Indonesian chili sauce), and your sunny side up egg.Selamat makan! (Enjoy your meal)

While I’ve received many lessons on how to stew chicken throughout my life, none of them came with amounts.

However I’m going to break the cycle here and offer a recipe you can depend on to create an amazing pot of stew chicken.

**Ingredients**

* 1 whole chicken *(cleaned and cut into bite size pieces)*
* 12 pimentos peppers *(seasoning peppers)*
* 12 cloves garlic
* 6 bundles chadon beni *(culantro/sawtooth coriander)*
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 2 tbsp roucou *(annatto extract) or 1 tsp annatto powder*
* 1 bay leaf
* A few dashes of Angostura Aromatic Bitters
* 1 cup coconut milk
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* salt &amp; black pepper *(to taste)*

**Making The Green Seasoning**

1. Place shadon beni, garlic and pimento into a food processor then grind until a smooth paste is formed

**Seasoning The Chicken**

1. Place chicken in a bowl then add 3 to 4 tbsp of green seasoning.
2. Add 4 to 5 liberal dashes of Angostura Aromatic Bitters.
3. Season with salt &amp; black pepper to taste.
4. Marinate for at least one hour. For best results, marinate overnight.

**Stewing The Chicken**

1. Allow the seasoning chicken to thaw to room temperature.
2. Add oil to a pot then add brown sugar.
3. Allow the sugar to start to melt then start stirring the oil and sugar to incorporate air into the mixture using a wooden or silicon spoon.
4. Continue to stir until the brown sugar mixture gets frothy then turns from light brown to dark brown.
5. Add seasoned chicken to the pot then toss to ensure each piece of chicken gets coated with the caramelized sugar.
6. Once all pieces are coated, cover and allow to cook for 5 to 8 minutes on medium/low heat.
7. Add 4 to 5 dashes of Angostura Aromatic Bitters to the pot.
8. Add roucou, bayleaf, tomato paste and coconut milk to the pot.
9. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
10. Reduce heat to low then cover chicken and allow to cook for 10 to 12 minutes.
11. Serve and enjoy!

here's my recipe if you want it! :)

**Ingredients**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 pound ground chicken
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* Pinch of cayenne powder, optional
* 5 scallions, trimmed and minced; white and green parts kept separate
* 7-ounce can diced green chilies
* 16-ounce jar salsa verde
* 6 cups water or chicken stock
* 1 pound butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into bite-sized cubes
* 1 cup dry orzo
* Salt and pepper
* Sour cream, optional, for serving

**Cook the chicken:**

1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 8–12 minutes, breaking it up as it cooks until completely cooked through.
2. Add the chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne powder, and white parts of the scallions. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the soup:**

Add the green chilies and salsa verde. Pour in the water and add the butternut squash. Add a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes until the squash is tender.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Taste the soup and add more salt and pepper if needed. Use the back of your spoon to mash up some of the squash to make a thicker broth.
2. Return to a boil and add the orzo. Cook for 10–12 minutes until the orzo is tender. Stir regularly to prevent the orzo from sticking. See note.
3. Turn the heat to low. Add half the minced scallion greens. Simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and season once more. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with the remaining scallion greens and a dollop of sour cream if you like. Enjoy! Notes

This is meant to be a very simple recipe, so the ingredients are limited. If you make it as-is, be sure you're salting throughout and salting well so it has enough flavor! Particularly if you use water.

If you don't keep vegan, you can add bacon or even crumbled Italian sausage and finish with Parmesan cheese for a richer, heartier dish.

If you keep vegan and want to pump it up, finish with grated plant-based Parm. You can also add more veggies to this. I think it would be great with fried mushrooms cooked before the onion and added back in with the broth/water.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil for frying
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 2 (15-ounce) cans white beans, drained and rinsed, or 3 cups fully cooked white beans from 1 cup dry white beans
* Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste
* 6 cups water or vegetable stock
* 8 ounces elbow pasta or your favorite small pasta like ditalini or orzo 1 head Lacinato kale, stems removed and leaves torn
* 1 cup loosely packed fresh herbs such as basil, parsley, dill, or a mix; roughly chopped; a pinch reserved for garnish

**Sauté the onion and beans:**

1. Heat the neutral oil in a wide pot on medium-high. Add the onion and cook for 6 to 7 minutes until it just begins to soften. Add the beans and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Pour in the water or stock and season the liquid with salt, pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper if you like. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Taste and season periodically.

**Cook the pasta:**

Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package instructions, then drain. Set aside.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Add the kale and fresh herbs to the pot of beans and simmer for an additional 5 to 10 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the cooked pasta between bowls and ladle the soup over the pasta. Garnish each bowl with more fresh herbs. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17wrwd9/herby_green_pasta_e_fagioli/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17wrwd9/herby_green_pasta_e_fagioli/

If you don’t have time to make chicken broth, simply shred up a rotisserie chicken and use 32 ounces of store-bought chicken broth!

**Chicken broth:**

* 3–4 pound whole chicken, neck and giblets reserved for another use
* 10–12 cups water
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt

**Soup:**

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 small carrots, peeled and diced
* 4 ribs celery, trimmed and diced
* 1 tablespoon garlic powder, or use 6–8 minced garlic cloves
* 2 teaspoons dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, more or less to taste
* ½ cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained and chopped
* 8 cups chicken broth, from above
* 1 cup dry ditalini
* ½ cup heavy cream, more if desired
* 4 ounces baby spinach, roughly chopped
* 1 lemon, juiced
* ¼ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, for garnish
* 16 fresh basil leaves, for garnish
* Salt and pepper

**Make the broth:**

1. Place the chicken in a large pot and cover with water. Add the salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour.
2. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl. Turn the heat on the broth to medium and low boil for 20 minutes or until the liquid reduces to about 8 cups. Strain the broth through a sieve into a large bowl. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.
3. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bird and shred or dice it into bite-sized pieces. Reserve the skin for another use (like snacking on it or frying it up for a crispy garnish) and reserve the carcass for stock if you like.

**Start the soup:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook for 8–10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Add the garlic powder, thyme, and crushed red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute.
3. Add the sun-dried tomatoes along with a teaspoon or two of the tomato oil from the jar. Cook for 1 minute more.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Pour in the broth and add the shredded chicken. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the ditalini and cook for 1-2 minutes under al dente. Drain.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Taste the soup once more. Stir in the cooked ditalini, heavy cream, and baby spinach. Simmer for 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and season a final time. Turn off the heat. Note: You can also serve and store ditalini separately from the soup if you're averse to pasta swelling the next day.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with freshly grated Parmesan and a few basil leaves. Finish with freshly cracked black pepper, if you like.

**Short ribs:**

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 pounds boneless beef short ribs
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 cups low-sodium beef stock
* 3 cups Cabernet Sauvignon or similar full-bodied red wine
* 10 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly crushed
* 2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Parmesan mashed potatoes:**

* 4 large Yukon gold potatoes, about 1½ pounds
* 2 tablespoons butter
* ⅓ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
* ⅓ cup heavy cream or whole milk
* 2 tablespoons chives, minced
* Salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika to taste

**Prepare the short ribs:**

1. Pat the beef dry and season with salt and pepper.
2. In a large, wide pot, heat the oil over medium-high until hot. Add the short ribs in an even layer and cook without moving for 3 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 2-3 minutes per side until browned all over. Remove from the pot. Turn the heat to medium.
3. Add the garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and, using the back of your spoon, gently press the paste into any browned bits left in the bottom of the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes until the paste deepens in color.
4. Pour in the red wine and lift up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the beef stock. Bring to a boil. Add the beef short ribs back to the pot and reduce heat to a low simmer. Simmer, covered, for 3 hours. Taste and season.
5. Remove and discard the garlic cloves. Skim off as much fat from the top as you can. If you can refrigerate the short ribs overnight, you can remove the fat the next day before proceeding with the recipe. If you don't want to wait, just skim off what you can while it's still warm and proceed with the recipe as-is.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Remove the ribs from the broth and bring the broth to a rapid simmer over medium-low. Cook for 25 minutes until the broth reduces by half and thickens. Mount the cold butter into the sauce, whisking to incorporate until glossy. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
2. Using your fork, tear the ribs into large pieces. Add them back to the sauce and toss to coat.

**Prepare the mashed potatoes:**

1. Peel and quarter the potatoes. Cover with salted water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 20-25 minutes until fork-tender.
2. Drain the potatoes and return them to the warm pot. Allow any residual water to evaporate for 5 minutes. You can turn the heat to low to speed up this process.
3. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl with the butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and heavy cream. Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes until they reach your desired consistency. Add the chives, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and paprika, and mash to incorporate. If the potatoes seem dry, add a few more splashes of heavy cream.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the potatoes between plates. Add a few pieces of the beef on top and drizzle the sauce all over.

17nkyzf,Al Pastor Tacos,307,13,1699102150.0,0.97,Recipe,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/o47egloxubyb1.jpg,"Check out my Al Pastor Recipe for Tacos. This homemade version of pork &amp; pineapple tacos is prepared with grilled tenderloin to get the result similar to traditionally used rotisserie, very quick in preparation and absolutely delicious.  
  
The taco meat recipe includes the use of chipotle paste. However, if you have any traditional Mexican dried chilies like guajillo or ancho chilies, you can incorporate them into the marinade by rehydrating them, removing the seeds, and blending them into a paste.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for Al Pastor:**

\* 1 lbs Pork tenderloin - (450g) thinly sliced

\* 2 slices Pineapple - finely chopped

\* 1 Onion, medium size - cut in half and sliced

\* 1 Red bell pepper - sliced

\* 5 Garlic cloves - minced

\* 2 tsp Chipotle paste - (Instead you can use traditional Mexican dried chilies like guajillo or ancho chilies, rehydrate and use in the marinade)

\* 2 tbsp Vegetable oil

\* ½ tsp Salt

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for Al Pastor spice blend:**

\* 1 tbsp Paprika

\* 1 tbsp Ground cumin

\* 1 tsp Epazote - (optional)

\* 1 tsp Oregano

\* ½ tsp Black pepper

\* 1 tsp Annatto seeds - (you can use achiote paste to marinate pork instead)

\* 2 Cloves

&amp;#x200B;

**To serve:**

\* 12 Small corn taco tortillas

\* Salsa

\* Guacamole

\* Pickled Red Jalapeño &amp; Pineapple

\* 1 handful Fresh coriander - (cilantro)

\* Cheese - Choose: Oaxaca, Cheddar, Queso Fresco, Mozzarella.

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

1. In a spice grinder, combine paprika, cumin, epazote (if using), oregano, black pepper, annatto seeds, and cloves. Grind into a fine powder.
2. In a large bowl, combine the spice blend, minced garlic, half of the vegetable oil, chopped pineapple and salt. Add the thinly sliced pork tenderloin and toss until the pork is well-coated with the marinade. (While refrigerating overnight will enhance the flavour, it's not a necessary step.).
3. Preheat your grill to 460°F (240°C). Place the marinated pork on a tray and grill for about 12-15 minutes or until the pork is cooked through and has a slightly charred exterior. Go to another step while waiting for pork.
4. In a large skillet, heat the remaining vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion and red bell pepper until they are soft and slightly caramelized, about 5-7 minutes. Then add a splash of water, cover with a lid, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for another 5 minutes.
5. Add grilled pork to the skillet with the sautéed vegetables. Add 2 tsp of chipotle paste to the mixture, tossing everything together well to ensure the flavours meld. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on medium heat, stirring occasionally.
6. Warm the taco tortillas in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side or until they are soft and pliable. To serve, place a few slices of pork and vegetable mixture on each tortilla. Top with your choice of salsa, guacamole, pickled red jalapeño &amp; pineapple, fresh coriander, and cheese. Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade Al Pastor tacos!

Here's my recipe! I've been eating so much chicken and rice...this variation was SO good!

**Broth:**

* 2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 8 cups water, plus more if needed
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and quartered
* Salt

**Soup:**

* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 3 ribs celery, trimmed and diced
* 4 carrots, peeled and sliced into rounds
* 2 teaspoons dry thyme
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more if desired
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 cup dry white wine or water
* 1 cup jasmine rice, rinsed well
* 1 lemon, juiced
* 4 ounces baby spinach, chopped
* Salt and pepper

**Make the broth:**

1. Place the chicken in a large pot and cover with water. Add the onion and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Remove foam and scum as it floats to the top of the broth while the chicken cooks.
2. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl. Return the broth to a low boil over medium heat. Simmer for 10–15 minutes or until the broth reduces and darkens a bit in color. You should be left with about 5–6 cups of broth.
3. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the spent onion. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.

**Prepare the chicken:**

1. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, carefully pick the meat from the bones and shred it with two forks or your fingers.
2. Discard the bones and skin. You can also dice the cooked skin and air-fry or pan-fry it to make a crunchy garnish for the soup if you like.

**Cook the mushrooms:**

1. Turn the heat on the pot to medium. Add the mushrooms and cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes. The mushrooms will release water, and that water will evaporate.
2. Once the water evaporates and the mushrooms begin to “squeak” in the pot, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and cook for 2 minutes until golden brown. Season with a pinch of salt.

**Sauté the aromatics:**

1. Add the onion, celery, and carrots to the mushrooms and cook for 5–7 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, thyme, paprika, and crushed red pepper to taste. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Deglaze the pot with 1 cup of white wine or water. Stir well to lift up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes.
2. Pour in the prepared broth and bring to a boil. Stir in the chicken. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the rice:**

1. Return the soup to a boil. Stir in the rice and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes or until the rice is tender. Add another cup or two of water if the rice absorbs too much liquid. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Add the lemon juice and spinach. Simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls. Serve with more lemon or the crispy chicken skin. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17eso82/chicken_and_rice_soup/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17eso82/chicken_and_rice_soup/

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients  
  
 

* 2 cups All-Purpose Flour
* 1 TBSP Baking Powder
* 1/2 tsp Baking Soda
* 1 tsp Fine Sea Salt
* 1/4 Cup Butter, Unsalted
* 1 Cup Buttermilk (or regular milk)

&amp;#x200B;

Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F / 230°C . If using a cast iron skillet, add 1 Tbsp Shortening and place it in the oven to preheat.
2. Whisk together 2 cups Flour, all-purpose, 1 Tbsp Baking powder, 1/2 tsp Baking soda, and 1 tsp Salt, fine sea in a large mixing bowl. Note: If you are using milk instead of buttermilk, leave out the baking soda. Baking soda reacts with the acid in the buttermilk to help with leavening, if milk is used then it is not needed.
3. Cut ¼ cup Butter, unsalted into cubes then using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour mixture. If you do not have a pastry blender you can either use two knives and slash them against each other, use your hands to squish the butter or if you have a food processor you can pulse it a few times.
4. Gradually add 1 cup Buttermilk (or milk) to the dry ingredients, if using milk you will need less of it since it isn't as thick. Depending on your environment, you may not need all of the buttermilk or you may need a bit more. The dough should be sticky but not too wet that you cannot handle it. If it becomes too sticky, simply add a bit more flour.
5. Dust a clean, flat surface with some flour and scoop out the dough. Sprinkle some flour on it then using your hands, knead a few times into a ball then fold the dough over itself 2 – 3 times.
6. Pat the dough to about an ½-inch in thickness. The thicker the dough, the higher the biscuits will be so feel free to adjust to your preference, you will just end up with more or less biscuits depending on thickness.
7. Cut the biscuits out with a biscuit cutter, cookie cutter or a cleaned out empty can. Set the biscuits aside.
8. Take the dough scraps, knead them together, pat it out, and cut out some more biscuits. You should end up with 8-9 biscuits.
9. Once they are all cut, remove the cast iron skillet from the oven and carefully place each biscuit into the hot oil (if using). Carefully flip over each biscuit so both sides are coated in oil, this will ensure both sides get browned. You want to place them closer together but not touching. As they start to expand, they will be forced to expand upwards instead of outwards.
10. Carefully place the pan back into the oven and bake for 10 minutes.
11. Check to see if they are golden brown and if so then remove from the oven. If they need more time, rotate the pan and keep an eye on them as they should be ready to pull within a few minutes.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17dinyf/homestyle_buttermilk_biscuits/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17dinyf/homestyle_buttermilk_biscuits/

2. Once the noodles are cooked, immediately strain and add to the ice bath. Agitate and gently scrub the noodles in the bowl to remove any excess starch (prevents them from sticking together; especially important if you're meal-prepping this dish).
3. Make the sauce by combining the dashi, 1/4 cup of soy sauce, mirin, grated ginger, and green onion. If you don't have time to make dashi, you can use HonDashi which is like a dashi base. Just combine 1 teaspoon of the HonDashi with 1 cup of boiling water &amp; stir. 
4. Cook the broccoli in a pan over medium-high heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring often. Add in the garlic and toss for about a minute. Set aside. 
5. Wipe out the pan and over high heat, add a drizzle of neutral oil. Toss in the cleaned shrimp and stir fry for 3-5 minutes depending on the size of the shrimp. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and cook for another minute. Pepper to taste.
6. Plate the noodles, shrimp, broccoli, and garnishes &amp; serve the dipping sauce in a small bowl. And enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17cim3c/shrimp_broccoli_soba_noodles_with_dashisoy/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17cim3c/shrimp_broccoli_soba_noodles_with_dashisoy/

Prep Time: 10 minutes | Cook Time: 30 minutes | Inactive time: 1 hour 5 minutes

Servings: 4 | Calories per serving: 596kcal

**Broth:**

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1½ pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and roughly chopped
* 1 head of garlic, top cut off, and cloves left in paper
* 2 bay leaves
* 6 cups water, more if needed

**Chicken and rice:**

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 3 small carrots, peeled and diced

* 2 teaspoons dry thyme
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 1 cup arborio or carnaroli rice
* 5 scallions, minced; white and green parts kept separate
* ½ lemon, juiced and ½ lemon cut into wedges
* Salt and pepper

**Start the broth:**

1. Pat the chicken dry and season with salt and pepper.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 5 minutes without moving until browned and crisp. Flip and cook for 5 minutes more.
3. Add the onion, garlic, and bay leaves to the pot. Pour the water on top, adding more if needed to immerse the chicken. Season with a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered for 45 minutes.

**Finish the broth:**

1. Scoop the chicken out of the broth and transfer it to a large bowl. Transfer the head of garlic to a small bowl.
2. Pour the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl and discard the solids. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.
3. Remove the skin from the chicken and pick the meat from the bones. Shred the chicken and add it to the bowl of broth. Note: You can fry the chicken skin and crumble it over the soup for a crispy garnish if you like.

**Prepare the garlic:**

1. Pop the garlic cloves from the paper and mash them into a paste with a fork. Set aside.

**Make the chicken and rice:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the onion and carrots and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 6–8 minutes until softened. Add the garlic paste, thyme, and paprika and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the white parts of the scallions and cook for another 30 seconds.
2. Add the rice and toss to coat. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add another pinch of salt.
3. Pour in the broth and chicken and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20–25 minutes or until the rice is tender and the broth is thick. If you like it soupier, add another cup of water and another pinch of salt.

**Finish the chicken and rice:**

1. Taste the chicken and rice and add more salt and pepper if needed. Stir in the lemon juice and half the scallion greens. Simmer for 3–5 minutes. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the chicken and rice into shallow bowls and garnish with lemon wedges and the remaining scallion greens. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17cfkpm/chicken_and_rice/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17cfkpm/chicken_and_rice/

**Ingredients:**


* 1.5kg of apples 


* 500g of sugar


* Skin of one lemon (zested or finely grated)


* Juice of one lemon


* 1.5 tablespoons of cinnamon


* 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger (grated)


* 1 teaspoon of nutmeg (ground)


* 1/2 cup of water


**Instructions:**


1. **Preparation:** Wash, peel, core, and dice the apples. To prevent them from browning, immerse the diced apples in water mixed with some of the lemon juice.


2. **Cooking:** In a large pot, combine the apple dices, sugar, lemon zest, remaining lemon juice, cinnamon, fresh ginger, nutmeg, and water.


3. **Boiling:** Bring the mixture to a boil on high heat. Once it's boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer. Cook until the apples are soft and mushy.


4. **Blending:** If you like a smoother texture, blend the mixture (an immersion blender works great here). I used a regular blender though. 


5. **Final Boil:** Transfer the blended mix (or keep it in the same pot if you used an immersion blender) and bring it to a boil once more. Then, reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer until it thickens.


6. **Testing:** To check its readiness, place a little jam on a plate and draw a line through with your finger. If it maintains the separation and doesn’t run, it’s ready!


7. **Storage:** Sterilize your glass containers by boiling them. For the lids, a trick I learned is to clean them with vodka. Pour the hot jam into the jars, seal them, and let them cool to room temperature.


Serve it on bread, muffins, or even as a topping for desserts. The fresh ginger gives it a nice kick, and the blend of spices makes it taste like autumn in a jar! 🍁

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/pumpkin-whoopie-pies-with-cream-cheese-filling/](https://maplewoodroad.com/pumpkin-whoopie-pies-with-cream-cheese-filling/)

**INGREDIENTS**

***Cookies***

* 3 cups all purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1 cup light brown sugar
* 1-½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* ½ teaspoon ground cloves
* 15 ounces pure pumpkin puree
* 1 cup vegetable oil
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla

***Cream Cheese Filling***

* 8 ounces cream cheese, softened to room temperature
* 6 Tablespoons unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
* 3 cups powdered (confectioners) sugar

**INSTRUCTIONS**

***Making the cookies***

* You can make this cookie dough in either a stand mixer, a handheld mixer, or just with a spoon and a couple bowls!
* Preheat oven to 350℉.
* In one bowl, stir together all dry ingredients, including the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, granulated sugar, light brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves.
* Using a second bowl, stir together the wet ingredients of pumpkin puree, oil, eggs, and vanilla extract.
* Now, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir or mix together, being careful not to overmix. The batter will still be quite wet when it's all mixed, and this is to be expected.
* Using an ice cream scoop, spoon out portions of dough and place on a parchment lined baking sheet, about 1 inch apart. I found it helpful to scoop the batter with the ice cream scoop, and hold a smaller spoon in the other hand, to help nudge the sticky batter onto the baking sheet.
* Bake on the center rack of the oven for about 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly dry and the center springs back when lightly touched.
* Let the cookies cool completely on a wire rack.

***Making the cream cheese filling***

* To make this filling, you should use either a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or a handheld electric mixer.
* Place the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract into a bowl and mix until creamy, about one minute.
* Then, add the powdered sugar one cup at a time, mixing each time until smooth.

***Adding the filling to the cookies***

* Once the cookies have completely cooled, you're ready to add the filling.
* You can either spread the filling with a spoon or butter knife, or pipe it on using a piping bag...the choice is yours.
* Turn one cookie upside down and spread an even layer of filling across it, as thin or as thick as your heart desires! I prefer somewhere between a quarter- and a half-inch of filling.
* Then, gently place a similar size cookie on top of the filling.
* Let chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving (if you have the willpower to wait!).
* All that's left to do is enjoy your own homemade pumpkin whoopie pies!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17a7qx3/pumpkin_whoopie_pies_with_cream_cheese_filling/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17a7qx3/pumpkin_whoopie_pies_with_cream_cheese_filling/

178e2qn,Polish Potato Pancakes (Placki Ziemniaczane),537,60,1697371963.0,0.98,Recipe,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/uwftnvv8ycub1.jpg,"Check out my cherished family recipe for Polish Potato Pancakes (Placki Ziemniaczane) This is among my favourite potato dishes, ideal when paired with a savoury sauce or enjoyed by itself.  
My love for potato pancakes was inherited from my grandfather. Whenever I visited his farm, he would prepare these large pancakes using potatoes he’d grown himself. We would binge on them together, savouring every bite. Those moments really stuck with me, and I’ve loved them ever since. I was hooked.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

\* 2.2 lbs Large Starchy Potatoes - (1kg or 4-5 large potatoes) Russet, Yukon Gold or other floury variety.

\* 1 Medium Onion

\* 3 Garlic Cloves

\* 1 Egg

\* 2-3 tbsp All-Purpose Flour - (Plain Flour)

\* ¾ cup Vegetable Oil - (200ml) for shallow frying

\* 1-2 tsp Salt

\* Black Pepper - to taste

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

**1.** Grate the peeled potatoes using the large holes of a grater. For the onion and garlic, you can mince them using a food processor. Then, add them to the grated potatoes.

**2.** Place the grated potato, onion, and garlic mixture into a fine mesh strainer or cheese cloth, and squeeze out as much liquid as you can. This step ensures the pancakes become crispier. (keep the liquid, read the recipe notes)

**3.** Transfer the strained mixture to a large bowl. Add the egg, flour, salt, and pepper. Mix well until everything is thoroughly combined.

**4.** In a large frying pan, heat half of the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, take a two spoonful of the potato mixture, flatten it into a pancake shape in the hot oil. 5.

**5.** Fry each side until golden brown and crispy, roughly 2-3 minutes per side (You may need to add more oil later).

**6.** After frying, place the pancakes on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.

**7.** Serve the potato pancakes while hot. They pair wonderfully with sour cream or your favourite sauce.

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

**Best Potatoes for Latkes:** Starchy potatoes, like Russet or Yukon Gold, are ideal for this recipe as they yield a crispier pancake.

Batter Consistency: Ensure the consistency of the batter is thick enough to hold together. If it seems too wet, you can add a bit more flour. Conversely, if it feels too dry, consider adding another egg.

**Potato Starch:** After squeezing the water from the grated potatoes, don’t discard the liquid immediately. Let it settle for a moment. At the bottom of the bowl, you’ll notice some potato starch sediment. This is pure potato starch, and you can carefully pour off the water and then add this starch back into your potato mixture. It can enhance the texture of the pancakes and make them more cohesive.

**Pancake Size:** The size of your potato pancakes can vary based on how you intend to serve them. You can opt for smaller or larger sizes. My grandfather, for instance, used to make them as large as the entire pan! 🙂

Servings: 4

Calories: 410kcal

**Ingredients**

* 12 ounces dry orzo
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed, wiped clean, and sliced
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
* 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* Sugar and crushed red pepper to taste
* 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
* 3 ounces baby spinach, roughly chopped
* Salt and pepper
* Smoked olive oil, optional, for serving

**Cook the orzo:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a generous pinch of salt and add the orzo. Cook until just shy of al dente, about 7 minutes. Scoop out ¼ cup of the pasta water and set it aside. Drain the pasta and set aside. Note: If you’re worried about the orzo sticking, you can cook the pasta in one pot and begin the sauce in a second pot.
2. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.

**Make the sauce:**

1. Turn the heat on the pot to medium and add the mushrooms. Cook for 5–7 minutes until they begin to release their liquid. Add the extra virgin olive oil and the red onion. Cook, turning often, until the mushrooms deepen in color and the onion softens, about 7–9 minutes.
2. Add the garlic, a pinch of sugar, and a pinch of crushed red pepper to the pot. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
3. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and balsamic vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer the sauce rapidly for 10–15 minutes. If the sauce begins to stick or evaporates too quickly, add a splash of water and reduce the heat to low. Taste and add salt, pepper, sugar, or crushed red pepper to taste.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Add the chopped spinach to the pot and cook for 2–3 minutes. Add the orzo and toss to coat. Cook for 1–2 minutes until the orzo is well coated, adding a splash of pasta cooking water as needed. Taste and season. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the orzo between shallow bowls and drizzle with smoked olive oil. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/175hg1f/easy_tomato_orzo/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/175hg1f/easy_tomato_orzo/

**Servings:** 3

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Cooking time:** 30

**Prep time:** 10 minutes

**Ingredients:**

* 3 sweet potatoes, baked
* 6-7 mushroom, chunked
* 11 cloves of garlic, peeled
* 2 big handful chickpeas, boiled or canned
* 6 piece(75 gr) cream cheese or 3 tablespoon, diced, 2 piece for each kumpir
* 1 cucumber’s skin, thinly sliced
* 3 pinches sesame seeds, roasted
* Parmesan cheese, grated
* 3 pinches black pepper
* 3 tablespoons chili oil, optional, recipe below
* Truffle salt, recipe below
* 1 teaspoon paprika 

**Directions:**

1. Bake sweet potatoes in the air fryer at 180°C (356°F) for 15 minutes, flipping occasionally.  
2. In a bowl, mix the chickpeas with 5 or 6 cloves of garlic, a bit of chili oil, some olive oil, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Put them in the air fryer rack next to the sweet potatoes. After the first 15 minutes of cooking are finished, bake them together with the chickpeas at 200°C (392°F) for another 15-20 minutes until fork tender, depending on the size of the sweet potatoes.
3. While the potatoes and chickpeas are cooking, sauté the mushrooms in a pan with the remaining garlic and a little olive oil.
4. Make a big and deep cut along the potato lengthwise while it is still hot without cutting off the ends. Sprinkle some truffle salt, truffle oil and 2-3 cloves of air fryed garlics (which you put with chickpeas) then insert a fork into the slit and mash the soft potato and mix it with ingredients. Be careful not to damage the skin.
5. Combine crème cheese, chickpeas, mushrooms, sprinkle a pinch of sesame seed and cucumbers inside the sweet potatoes. Grate some parmesan and ready to dig in!

# Chili Oil

1.  Pour the oil and peppers in a small pan and heat the oil on low heat to 100°C (212°F), without boiling.
2. Heat the oil in this way for 5 minutes, then turn the heat off and leave it to cooldown. Transfer to a light-proof bottle or tin  and use it whenever you want. For the oil to last long, I recommend you keep it in a cool place away from sunlight.

**Ingredients (serves 2-3)**

* Rice: 1.5 cups  
Cook at most a sixth of your cooker’s max capacity. You need room to stack the plates of protein and veg.
* Fish: 300g  
About the same volume as rice. Cut into very small pieces, to make sure it cooks in the steam. I happened to have Panagsius (the absolute cheapest fish I can get around here; best way I can describe it is catfish but mushy), but any firm fleshed fish like catfish or grouper would also work. Season it with salt and white pepper as well as some corn starch, and optionally top with XO sauce for some extra savoury flavour.
* Broccoli: 1 small head  
Also approximately the same volume as the rice. I used broccoli, cut into florets and sprinkled with salt. Other vegetables like green beans, asparagus or cauliflower would also work.

**Instructions:**

1. Begin by making the rice. Put rice and water into the rice cooker and start it.

2. Cut and season the fish. Arrange on a heat-resistant plate and top.

3. Once the water in the rice cooker is boiling, place the dish with the fish into the rice cooker.

4. Cut, season and arrange broccoli onto another heat-resistant plate.

5. With a few minutes left on the rice cooker’s timer, place the broccoli into the rice cooker as well.

6. Tower of Doom is complete! Once rice is done, take each layer out and serve.

16olzdm,[OC] Apple Cider Glazed Chicken,187,13,1695317780.0,0.94,Recipe,Bee-Stop,https://i.redd.it/7d7i5mu67npb1.jpg,"Ingredients for the Apple Cider Glaze :  
1 cup apple cider  
2 fresh apples, peeled, cored, and chopped  
2 tablespoons olive oil  
1 tablespoon minced garlic  
1 sprig of fresh rosemary  
2 sprigs of fresh thyme  
Salt and pepper to taste  
Ingredients for Apple Cider Glazed Chicken:  
1 whole halal chicken (3-4 pounds)  
2 cups apple cider  
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar  
1/4 cup olive oil  
1/4 cup brown sugar  
3 cloves garlic, minced  
2 teaspoons Dijon mustard  
1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped  
1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves  
1 teaspoon chopped sage  
Salt and black pepper to taste  
Fresh herbs and lemon slices for garnish  
Apple Cider glaze to pour on the chicken  
Specific Kitchen Tools and Appliances:  
Roasting Pan: A sturdy roasting pan with a rack is essential for even cooking and proper air circulation around the chicken.  
Basting Brush: This tool will come in handy for applying the apple cider glaze throughout the roasting process.  
Meat Thermometer: To ensure your chicken is perfectly cooked, invest in a meat thermometer. It takes the guesswork out of determining when your chicken is done, ensuring it’s safe to eat without overcooking.  
Kitchen Twine: If your chicken isn’t pre-trussed, you’ll need kitchen twine to secure the legs and wings, ensuring even cooking.  
Instructions for the Apple Cider Glaze:  
Simmer the Apple Cider: In a saucepan over medium heat, pour in the apple cider. Bring it to a gentle simmer and let it cook until it reduces by half. This will intensify the apple flavor and sweetness. It should take about 15-20 minutes.  
Sauté the Aromatics: In another saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for a minute or until it becomes fragrant.  
Add the Chopped Apples: Toss in the chopped apples and sauté for about 3-4 minutes until they begin to soften.  
Combine with Reduced Cider: Pour the reduced apple cider into the saucepan with the apples. Stir to combine all the ingredients.  
Add Fresh Herbs: Place the fresh rosemary and thyme sprigs into the mixture. These aromatic herbs will infuse the glaze with delightful flavors.  
Simmer and Reduce: Let the glaze simmer over medium-low heat for an additional 10-15 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld, and the glaze should thicken slightly. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  
Strain and Cool: Once the glaze has reached your desired consistency, remove it from the heat. Using a fine mesh strainer, strain the glaze into a bowl to remove the solid pieces, leaving behind a smooth, velvety glaze. Let it cool to room temperature.  
Instructions for the Apple Cider Glazed Chicken:  
Preheat the Oven:  
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).  
Prepare the Chicken:  
Remove the giblets and any excess fat from the chicken cavity.  
Rinse the chicken inside and out with cold water. Pat it dry with paper towels.  
Marinate the Chicken:  
In a bowl, whisk together the apple cider, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, brown sugar, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, chopped rosemary, chopped thyme, salt, and black pepper.  
Place the chicken in a large resealable plastic bag or a deep dish.  
Pour the apple cider marinade over the chicken.  
Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight, turning the chicken occasionally.  
Truss the Chicken:  
If desired, truss the chicken by tying the legs together with kitchen twine to help it cook evenly.  
Basting and Roasting:  
Place the marinated chicken on a rack in a roasting pan.  
Brush the chicken with some of the apple cider glaze.  
Roast in the preheated oven for approximately 20 minutes per pound (450g) or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165°F (74°C).  
Baste the chicken with the apple cider glaze every 20-30 minutes during roasting.  
Crisp Up the Skin:  
During the last 15 minutes of roasting, increase the oven temperature to 425°F (220°C) to help crisp up the chicken’s skin. Monitor it to prevent excessive browning.  
Rest and Serve:  
Once the chicken reaches the desired temperature and has a golden-brown, crispy skin, remove it from the oven.  
Tent the chicken loosely with aluminum foil and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving.  
Carve and Garnish:  
Glaze with the Apple Cider Glaze.  
Carve the chicken into serving pieces, such as thighs, drumsticks, and breast slices.  
Garnish with fresh herbs and citrus slices if desired.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/16olzdm/oc_apple_cider_glazed_chicken/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/16olzdm/oc_apple_cider_glazed_chicken/

If you are eating this for a full meal like me this is 4 servings. If it is just a snack…be prepared to share haha. Typically grape leaves are used so follow your heart ppl. I like it extra ~fresh~. 

Ingredients:

• 1 cup rice rinsed (using jasmine here bc that is what I had on hand but short grain is ideal)

•  1ish 2 ish cups vegetable broth 

•  1 yellow onion minced

• 2 garlic cloves minced

•  1 tbsp lemon zest

• Juice from 3 lemons

• ¼ cup pinenuts (roasted on parchment paper at 350 for 5-7 minutes, get it slightly golden)

•  ⅓ cup minced dill

• ¼ cup minced parsley

•  2 bundles swiss chard leaves. Could be rainbow, green, red…doesn’t matter hehe.

•  Salt and pepper to taste. 

Directions:
1. First we are going to blanch the swiss chard. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and then in batches submerge the swiss chard. It is just for a quick dip and then take them out. Rinsing under cold water when done or can place them in an ice bath if you prefer. Then destem and set aside. 
2. Next we are going to parboil the rice. Over medium heat saute onion until slightly browned. Add just a splash of water to prevent sticking and leave undisturbed for a few minutes and str. About 5-7 minutes. Adding more water as needed through the process. Then add garlic allowing this to get fragrant. About 30 seconds. Stir in the rice, ½ cup veg broth, and juice of 1 lemon. Bring to a boil then lowering to simmer covered for about 8 to 10 minutes or until liquids are absorbed. You can check on it every so often and stir. Take off heat uncovered and allow to cool. 
3. Once cooled stir in herbs, lemon zest, and pine nuts. At this point season to taste with salt and pepper and anything else. Want it more herby? Add more herbs. Or to infuse more flavor add some dried dill/parsley along with it. Want it more lemony? Add more zest. The world is your oyster. 
4. Time to fill these puppies up. For each side leaf of the swiss chard you can tear these into square like pieces like in the video. Add about a spoonful of the rice filling in the center horizontally, then you roll it up like a little burrito. So fold the sides in and then roll forward. Can use my video as a visual reference. Set aside seam side down as you do your thing with the remainder. 
5. For any scraps leftover with your chard leaves you can line the bottom of a pan with it to prevent sticking. Now one by one, add in your dolmades seam side down. I go in a circle until the bottom is filled and add any extras on top. Squeeze the juice of 2 lemons over it. Then fill with veg broth until the dolmades are about halfway covered. About 1 ¼ cup to 1 ½ cups. Bring to a simmer over medium heat then lowering to low/simmer. Cover and let it simmer for 45 minutes to an hour. Basically until the liquid is almost all absorbed and your dolmades are soft/rice is tender. 
6. Take off heat and let cool! Serve it up and have the time of your life!! Can eat it alongside some cucumbers and olives. Allll dipped into some baba ganoush or dip of choice. They taste even more magical the next day when they’ve had a chance to sit in the fridge overnight. ",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/16jl0ca/greek_inspired_dolmades/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/16jl0ca/greek_inspired_dolmades/

Serves: 4

Cook time: 1 hour

**Ingredients**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 medium onion peeled and diced
* 2 small leeks white and light green parts only, scrubbed and thinly sliced
* 4 ribs celery trimmed and finely diced
* 1 fennel bulb cored and thinly sliced, fronds reserved
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 5 cups water or low-sodium vegetable stock
* 1 pound potatoes scrubbed and peeled (or leave skins on, if you prefer), cut into 1″ cubes
* 1/4 cup heavy cream optional
* ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped sage
* Salt and pepper

**Cook the aromatics:**

1. Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften about 6–7 minutes.
2. Add the celery and fennel and cook for an additional 5 minutes—season with salt and pepper.

**Bloom the spices:**

1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the thyme, paprika, and garlic powder—Cook for 45 seconds.

**Prepare the roux:**

1. Sprinkle the flour over the aromatics. Cook, stirring regularly, for 3–4 minutes.
2. Slowly whisk in the water or stock in 1-cup increments. Whisk after each addition until smooth. Turn the heat to medium-high. Continue adding the liquid and whisking until all the liquid has been incorporated. Taste and season generously with salt and pepper.

**Cook the potatoes:**

1. Once the liquid is bubbly and simmering rapidly, add the potatoes. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 30 minutes until the potatoes are fork-tender. Taste and adjust the seasonings once more.

**Prepare the sage oil:**

1. As the potatoes simmer, prepare the sage oil. Pour the extra virgin olive oil into a small saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Once the oil is hot, add the sage. The oil should bubble as soon as the sage is added. Next, turn the heat to low and allow the oil and sage to bubble lightly over low heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Be careful not to burn the sage!
2. Turn off the heat and add a sprinkle of salt. Set aside.

**To serve:**

1. Once the potatoes are fork-tender, turn off the heat. Spoon the soup into bowls and garnish with reserved fennel fronds. Drizzle the sage oil on top. Enjoy!

16e5wv7,Sage Scones with Cheddar &amp; Chives,236,6,1694266409.0,0.98,Recipe,fuzzician,https://i.redd.it/ue2h1xrsd8nb1.jpg,"**SAVOURY SAGE SCONES RECIPE**  
*makes around 9 scones*

**Ingredients**

• 225g (approx. 1¾ US cups) **flour**  
• 11g (approx. 2½ tsp) **baking powder**  
• 4g (approx. ¾ tsp) fine sea **salt**  
• ½ tsp freshly cracked **black pepper**  
• ½ tsp **espelette pepper** *or other finely crushed / powdered dried chilies*  
• ½ tsp **chili flakes**  
• 55g (approx. ¼ US cups) **unsalted** **butter** *chilled*  
• 120g total (approx. 1½ US cups) of **freshly grated cheese** — use mature cheddar, emmenthal, and/or gruyère in whatever proportions you like  
• 100-120g (approx. 1½ US cups) **cream** *plus a bit more for glazing*  
• ½ tsp dijon **mustard**  
• fresh **chives** *you’ll need enough to get about 2 Tbsp’s worth, once chopped*  
• fresh **sage** leaves *you’ll need about 1 Tbsp’s worth, once chopped, plus 8 to 10 large whole leaves for topping your scones*  
• optional: extra virgin **olive oil** 

**Directions**

1. Preheat the oven to 205°C/400°F.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the **flour**, **baking powder**, **salt**, **black pepper**, **crushed dried chilies**, and **chili flakes**.
3. Cut the **butter** into cubes, then rub it into the flour mixture using your finger tips. Continue until the pieces of butter are pea-sized or smaller, and evenly distributed throughout. Sprinkle in all of the **chopped herbs** and 100g of the **grated cheese**. Mix again until well combined.
4. Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in 100g of **cream**. Stir through the **dijon mustard**, then combine the dry and wet ingredients until you arrive at a soft-but-firm dough that just comes together when pressed in your hand. If necessary, add up to 20g more of cream — a good way to do this is to remove the well-formed dough from the bowl and add liquid only to the dry crumbs remaining at the bottom, bit by bit. This enables you to hydrate only the parts of the mixture that need it, and avoids over-moistening the already-ready parts of the dough.
5. Tip the mixture out onto a lightly floured surface and use the palm of your hand as little as you can to pat it out into a rough circle, about 2cm/¾in thick. Using a lightly floured 5.5cm/2″ wide glass or biscuit cutter, cut out 9 or so scones, reforming the dough into a rough disk as needed in between rounds of cutting.
6. At this point, if you have room in your fridge or freezer, place the scones on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and transfer them to either to cool. In the meantime, bring a small pan of salted water to a boil. Pop in your reserved **sage leaves** for 30-45 seconds, just long enough to blanch them, then transfer them to a plate lined with a dish towel and pat them dry. Doing this will help prevent the leaves from shrivelling up too much and burning in the oven while the scones bake. At this point you may also want to brush each sage leaf with a bit of **olive oil**, although you don’t have to — it’ll make the leaves extra crisp.
7. Remove the scones from the fridge or freezer if you left them to chill. Brush each scone top with a bit of **cream**, then sprinkle the **remaining cheese** evenly over each scone, and top each one with a **sage leaf**. 
8. Bake for 17 minutes or so (every oven is different!), or until the scones have well risen and their cheesy tops look crisp and golden. Once out of the oven, they should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Serve immediately, or enjoy for up to 4 days post-bake: simply store in an airtight container at room temperature and reheat in the oven before savouring again.

Enjoy!

**Notes:** When it comes to scones, you want to keep the butter cold until the very end to maximise the level of flakiness in your finished bake. One way to do this is to chill the butter before you combine it with the other ingredients, and then, once shaped, to chill the unbaked scones once more just before placing them in the oven. [For more tips and details, feel free to check out the whole post here](https://www.allo-simone.com/recipes-en/savoury-sage-scones/) :)",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/16e5wv7/sage_scones_with_cheddar_chives/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/16e5wv7/sage_scones_with_cheddar_chives/

Cook Time: 20 minutes

Inactive Time: 50 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour 40 minutes 

Servings: 6 

Calories: 349kcal

**Ingredients**

* 3 tablespoons avocado oil divided
* 2½ pounds red or green kabocha divided
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons chili oil more or less depending on taste
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 6 cups water or vegetable stock plus more as needed
* 1 cup white rice
* Shichimi togarashi for serving
* Chili oil and sesame oil for serving
* Microgreens or sliced scallions optional, for serving
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prepare the kabocha:**

* Preheat oven to 400ºF. Place the kabocha on a baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a plate and let cool for 15-20 minutes. Do not turn the oven off.
* Once the kabocha is cool enough to handle, cut the kabocha in half from the top stem to the bottom of the kabocha.
* Scoop out the seeds and transfer them to a sieve.
* Peel one half of the kabocha and cut the flesh into bite-sized cubes. Set aside.
* Leave the skin on the remaining half of the kabocha and cut it into 2” cubes. Set aside.

**Prepare the soup base:**

* Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon avocado oil in a large pot. Add the onion and cook for 7 minutes until it softens. Add the peeled kabocha cubes to the onion and cook for 3–5 minutes until it begins to turn golden brown. Season with salt and pepper.
* Melt the butter into the pot and add the chili oil and sesame oil. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20–30 minutes until completely soft. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the squash seeds:**

* As the broth simmers, prepare the seeds. Rinse the warm seeds under water and remove the stringy bits of kabocha from them. Pat the seeds dry and arrange on the same baking sheet used for the kabocha. Add more oil, if needed.
* Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the oven for 10 minutes, flipping once midway through. Remove from the oven once the seeds are golden brown and crispy. Set aside.

**Cook the rice:**

* Once the kabocha is very tender, mash it with a potato masher or use an immersion blender to blend until completely smooth. Add the rice and the skin-on kabocha and season with salt. Keep the heat on low and simmer for 30 minutes or until the kabocha cubes and rice are very tender. Add more water as necessary if the liquid evaporates too quickly. Stir the soup regularly to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Taste and season again to your preferences.

**To serve:**

* Ladle the rice soup into bowls and pile a few pieces of skin-on kabocha on top. Garnish with more chili and sesame oil, a sprinkle of shichimi togarashi, and a few microgreens. Sprinkle the crispy kabocha seeds on top. Enjoy!

* Minced fresh red chili (use as little or as much as you like!)

**For the Cauliflower Rice:**

* 1 package of frozen cauliflower rice

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

**For the Cauliflower Rice:**

1. Add the frozen cauliflower rice to a pan and cook on medium-low until the cauliflower is tender and the moisture has evaporated (\~7-10 minutes). Add a sprinkle of salt, to taste.

**For the Thai Basil Chicken:**

1. Make the sauce by combining 1/4 cup oyster sauce, 2 tbs of soy sauce, 2 tbs of fish sauce, 1 tsp rice syrup, and lime juice in a small bowl. 
2. Heat a large pot over high heat until very hot--you'll want to see a little smoke coming off of the pan. 
3. Add in a drizzle of neutral oil and the chopped onion and chicken. Toss often for about 3 minutes, or until the chicken is browned. Then, add in the garlic and chilis (if using) and toss for another minute. 
4. Add in the sauce and continue tossing for another 1-2 minutes, until the chicken is fully cooked.
5. Turn off the heat and toss in the basil leaves.
6. Serve on top of cauliflower rice for a healthy, low-carb meal! Enjoy :)",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/16arplc/thai_basil_chicken_lowcarb_with_cauliflower_rice/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/16arplc/thai_basil_chicken_lowcarb_with_cauliflower_rice/

**Ingredients**

* 400g (1.5 cups) beef
* 2 carrots
* 4 potatoes
* 1 tomato
* 200g ( 1 cup) tomato sauce
* 15g (2 tbsp) all-purpose flour or corn flour
* Spices: 1 garlic clove, 3-5 slices of ginger, 1 shallot clove, 1 tsp five spice powder (optional)
* Salt and sugar
* Topping: chopped green onion, coriander, ground pepper

**Directions**

1. Season the beef cubes with salt and sugar, then rinse and cut them into bite-sized pieces. Add ginger, minced shallots, minced garlic, and five spice powder to marinate them. For enhanced flavor, marinate overnight.
2. Prep: Blanch the tomatoes in boiling water, remove the skin. Peel and cut the carrots and potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Slice the onion by keeping the stem and cut into 6-8 pieces then simply cut the stem to release all fleshy leaves (image below). Mince the shallots and garlic and cut the ginger into thin slices. Chop the green onion and coriander.
3. Heat cooking oil in a pot and sauté the tomatoes with half of the minced shallots and garlic (left image). Then, add a cup of tomato sauce (right image). Regardless of whether you're using a pressure cooker or a regular pot, you can add the tomatoes and tomato sauce directly to it instead of making another sauepan dirty.
4. (For Pressure Cooker) Add the marinated beef cubes and stir-fry until the meat firms up (1). Then, add enough water to cover the meat (2) . Close the lid of the pressure cooker and bring it to a boil (3). Once the pressure valve starts releasing steam, reduce the heat and open it (4). (For regular pot) If using a regular pot, simmer the beef for about 1 hour over medium heat.
5. (For pressure cooker) After releasing the pressure and opening the cooker, add the prepared carrots and potatoes and add more water if necessary. Close the lid again and bring it to a boil. Once the pressure valve starts releasing steam, reduce the heat and open the cooker. Add more water if needed. (For regular pot) After 1 hour of simmering the meat, add the prepared carrots and potatoes and cook for 15-20 minutes more. Add more water if needed.
6. Add the sliced onions and season the stew with salt and sugar according to your taste. Add the sliced onions and season the stew with salt and sugar according to your taste.
7. While waiting for the onions to soften, prepare a slurry by mixing all-purpose flour or corn flour with a little cold water. When the stew comes to a boil again, pour the slurry into the pot and stir quickly.
8. Serve the Vietnamese beef Ragu in bowls and garnish with chopped green onion, coriander, and ground pepper.

* 1/2 tsp dry mustard  
* 2tsp lemon juice

1.  Put all ingredients in a wide mouth mason jar (Check that your immersion blender fits, if not you may need a separate container.)  
  
2.  Put immersion blender at bottom of jar, turn on. 
  
3.  When you start seeing Mayo form at bottom of jar start rocking blender off the bottom a little at a time and slowly raise up as Mayo forms until the whole jar has emulsified.  Shouldn’t take more than 30 seconds total with a good immersion blender.  
  
4. Scrape extra Mayo out of immersion blender into the jar and stir to check for any small pockets of oil.  
  
5. Put the lid on and refrigerate until ready to use.  

  
I had to start making my own Mayo because of a soy allergy and I don’t miss store bought at all. The flavor and texture on this are way better than even the name brand Mayo I was using almost exclusively.  Keeps in the fridge at least 2 weeks, possibly longer but I’ve used it all up by then every time. Tastes best after resting an hour or 2 in the fridge as the salt dissolves and lemon juice and vinegar mellow out, but is still better than store bought when fresh made.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/169ea7n/easy_homemade_mayonnaise/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/169ea7n/easy_homemade_mayonnaise/

\* 2 cups mashed potatoes (cold, leftover works best)  
\* 1 1/2 cups cooked cabbage or Brussels sprouts, chopped  
\* 1/2 cup cooked carrots, chopped  
\* 1/2 cup cooked peas  
\* 1 small onion, finely chopped  
\* 2-3 tablespoons butter or oil  
\* Salt and pepper to taste  
Optional:  
\* Cooked meat like bacon or ham, chopped (about 1/2 cup)  
\* Grated cheese (cheddar or any melting cheese) - about 1/2 cup  
\* Worcestershire sauce or hot sauce for serving  
Preparation: 15 minutes | Cooking: 20 minutes | Total: 35 minutes  
Instructions  
1. To prepare bubble and squeak, start by chopping cooked cabbage or Brussels sprouts, carrots, and any optional meat into small pieces, ensuring the meat is heated through if using leftovers.  
2. Season the mashed potatoes with salt and pepper if needed. Sauté finely chopped onion in a large skillet with butter or oil until soft and translucent. Add the chopped vegetables and meat to the skillet, cooking for about 5-6 minutes to meld flavours.  
3. Gently fold in the cold mashed potatoes, being careful not to over-mash. Flatten the mixture in the skillet with a spatula and cook over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, allowing the bottom to crisp and turn golden brown. Carefully flip the bubble and squeak using a plate or spatula, adding more butter or oil and crisping the other side for an additional 10-15 minutes. Optionally, melt grated cheese on top during the last few minutes of cooking.  
4. Once both sides are golden and crispy, remove from heat, cut into wedges, and serve hot. Enhance with a drizzle of Worcestershire sauce or hot sauce, if desired.

15ssik2,Kimchi Ramen with Tofu,134,11,1692198590.0,0.96,Recipe,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/xym3pxt4nhib1.jpg,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Vegan Kimchi Ramen Recipe**](https://exploringvegan.com/vegan-kimchi-ramen-recipe/)

A couple of notes -- I use a product called ""super spicy kimchi paste"" -- it's a paste that can be used to make your own kimchi at home, or you can use it for flavoring as I did. You can omit it and use just gochujang and kimchi instead.

I didn't have fresh kimchi, but I had dehydrated so that's what I used in the broth. If you have fresh kimchi, feel free to chop it up and throw it in instead of dehydrated.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 pound firm tofu
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced
* 1 shallot, peeled and diced
* ¼ cup gochujang
* 1 tablespoon vegan kimchi paste, optional
* 6 cups water or vegetable broth
* 1 tablespoon dehydrated kimchi or ¼ cup fresh kimchi, chopped
* 3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce more or less to taste
* 3 teaspoons sesame oil, divided
* 8.4 ounces ramen noodles or use 4 blocks of instant ramen noodles
* 14.5- ounce can full-fat coconut milk
* 5 scallions, thinly sliced; white and green parts kept separate
* 1 cup frozen edamame
* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
* Salt to taste

**Press the tofu:**

1. Drain the tofu and wrap it with paper towels. Place on a plate with a heavy-bottomed pan on top. Set aside for 15–20 minutes. Cut into bite-sized cubes.

**Cook the mushrooms and shallot:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot. Add the mushrooms and cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes. Add the shallot and cook for 2–3 minutes until soft. Add a pinch of salt.

**Fry the gochujang and kimchi paste:**

1. Add the gochujang and kimchi paste to the pot. Cook for 1–2 minutes until it begins to deepen in color.

**Simmer the broth:**

1. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil. Add the kimchi, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce if needed. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings.

**Cook the noodles and tofu:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the ramen noodles according to package instructions. Drain into a colander and rinse. Divide the cooked noodles between four bowls.
2. Add the cubed tofu to the ramen broth and continue simmering as the noodles finish cooking.

**Finish the broth:**

1. Add the coconut milk and scallion whites to the broth and simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings.
2. Add the frozen edamame to the pot and simmer for 3–4 minutes more until bright green and warmed through. Taste and season. Turn off the heat.

**Prepare the garnish:**

1. In a small bowl, combine the scallion greens, remaining 2 teaspoons of sesame oil, sesame seeds, and a pinch of salt. Toss to coat.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the broth over the noodles. Serve with the scallion garnish on top. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15ssik2/kimchi_ramen_with_tofu/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15ssik2/kimchi_ramen_with_tofu/

Serves: 4

**Ingredients:**

* 1¾ pounds Yukon gold or russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
* 1 cup ricotta cheese
* ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving
* 2 tablespoons fresh chives or 1 tablespoon dry chives
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon white pepper
* 4 tablespoons butter, divided
* Splash of heavy cream or whole milk, if needed
* 2 ounces diced pancetta
* 1 medium shallot, peeled and sliced into rounds
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 pound pork tenderloin
* 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* ¾ cup chicken broth
* 8 ounces baby spinach
* ½ lemon, juiced (about 1½ tablespoons juice)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* Minced parsley, optional, for garnish

**Boil the potatoes:**

1. Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Add a liberal pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are fork-tender. Scoop out ½ cup of the cooking water and set it aside. Drain the potatoes.
2. Combine the ricotta, Parmesan cheese, chives, garlic powder, white pepper, and 2 tablespoons butter in a large bowl. Add ¼ cup of the potato cooking water and whisk until combined. The butter does not need to be completely melted. 
3. Add the cooked potatoes and use a masher to mash until mostly smooth. Taste and add salt and pepper. Add more of the potato cooking water or a splash of heavy cream as needed and continue mashing until the potatoes reach your desired consistency. Cover the bowl with foil and keep the potatoes warm.

**Cook the pancetta:**

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. Add the pancetta to a large, cold oven-proof wide pot and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook for 6–8 minutes, stirring frequently, until the pancetta is very crispy. Remove the pancetta from the pot using a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan.

**Caramelize the shallots:**

1. In the same pot over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once hot and shimmering, add the shallots, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes until the shallots begin to brown. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of sugar on top and continue cooking over low to medium-low heat (adjust the heat periodically as they cook) for 10 minutes more until evenly browned. Shallots burn very easily, so keep an eye on them!
2. Remove the shallots from the pot and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate. Season to taste with a sprinkle of salt. Carefully wipe out the skillet.

**Cook the pork tenderloin:**

1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the pot over medium-high. Once hot, add the pork tenderloin and cook for 3–4 minutes per side until the entire tenderloin is well-seared.
2. Transfer the pot to the oven and cook for an additional 15–18 minutes or until the pork reaches 135ºF at the thickest part. Remove the pot from the oven, transfer the tenderloin to a cutting board, and rest for 10 minutes. After the pork has rested, thinly slice and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.

**Make the spinach:**

1. Return the pot used for the pork tenderloin to the stove over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Once melted and bubbly, add the minced garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
2. Pour in the chicken broth and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Add the spinach and cook for 2–4 minutes, stirring regularly, until the spinach wilts. Add the lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and black pepper. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving platter and top with the spinach and a few spoonfuls of the pan sauce. Arrange the sliced pork tenderloin on top. Garnish with the crispy pancetta, browned shallots, and minced parsley. Spoon the remaining pan sauce on top of the pork.

•  1 whole Hokaido Pumpkin, skin on, seeds removed, and cubed (or a squash of your choice)

• 7 Diva apples, skin on, cored and cubed (or an apple variety of your choice)

• 3 Tbsp fresh sage, chopped (divided)

• 2 Tbsp Walnut Oil (divided)

• 2 tsp Sea Salt Flakes

• 1 tsp Fresh Ground Pepper

• 2 Tbsp Dark Maple Syrup (the darker the better)

• 2 Tbsp Brown Mustard

• 1/2 tsp Raw Apple Cider Vinegar

• Optional Garnishes: a sprinkle of Cinnamon or Sumac, Chopped Fresh Chives, Fresh Nasturtium Flowers

Method:

1. Preheat oven to 425 F
2. Prepare Squash: Toss cubed squash with 1 Tbsp Walnut Oil, 2 tsp salt, ground pepper, and half the chopped sage. Spread evenly on a baking sheet.
3. Place baking sheet in the oven and cook until squash begins to brown and becomes tender and delicious looking, about 20 minutes.
4. While the squash is cooking, toss the chopped apples in the remainder of the Walnut Oil and Sage (I add a dash of salt and pepper too).
5.  Add the diced apples onto the sheet pan, and stir to combine everything evenly. Place in oven for another 10 minutes.
6. During this cook time, immersion blend or stir together the Maple Syrup, Brown Mustard, and Apple Cider Vinegar. 
7. At this point the apples should still have some firmness, and the squash should be very tender. Take the Maple Syrup and Mustard mixture and drizzle it over the apples and squash. Place back in the oven and cook for 5 more minutes.
8. Remove from oven and plate! I garnished mine with some fresh Nasturtiums from the garden, but any fresh addition on top would be nice. Tarragon or Chives would be lovely! I've also garnished with sumac or cinnamon in other variations.

* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 6 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
* ½ cup roasted red bell peppers, diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
* ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste

* 3 tablespoons plant-based butter (or use dairy if you don't keep vegan)
* ½ cup freshly grated plant-based parmesan (or use dairy if you don't keep vegan)
* Salt and pepper

**Sauté the aromatics:**

1. Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion to the pot and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, occasionally stirring, for 8-9 minutes until golden brown. Adjust heat as needed. Add the roasted red peppers, garlic, thyme, and crushed red pepper.

**Cook the rice:**

1. Add the rice to the pot and toss to coat. Season with salt. Cook for 1 minute until it begins to toast lightly.
2. Pour in the wine and bring it to a boil. Cook for 1–2 minutes.

**Simmer the rice:**

1. Add water or vegetable stock and chickpeas and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20–25 minutes. Turn the heat to medium and partially remove the lid (the pot should be half-covered). Rapid simmer for 5 minutes.

**Finish the rice:**

1. Turn the heat on the rice to medium-low and stir regularly. Continue simmering and stirring to cook off any excess liquid if needed. Stir in the plant-based butter and parmesan and simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring regularly, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Consistency should be creamy, not soupy! Add salt if needed.

It’s often garnished with fresh cucumber slices and drizzled with a savory, sweet sauce before serving. This meal is a fusion of Thai and Chinese cuisine, where it’s known as char siu.

Recipe: [https://hungryinthailand.com/recipe/khao-moo-dang/](https://hungryinthailand.com/recipe/khao-moo-dang/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for marinating the pork**

**•** 3 cloves of garlic

**•** 2 coriander root

**•** 1.5 tablespoons Chinese five spice powder

**•** 1 teaspoon white pepper

**•** 4 tablespoons palm sugar

**•** 1⁄2 tablespoons sesame oil

**•** 2 tablespoons oyster sauce

**•** 2 tablespoons light soy sauce

**•** 1 tablespoon tapioca starch

**•** 1⁄4 teaspoons red food coloring

**•** 18 ounces pork (pork loin)

**Ingredients for making the sauce**

**•** 1 tablespoon palm sugar

**•** 1⁄2 tablespoons sesame oil

**•** 1⁄2 tablespoons roasted sesame seeds

**•** 1⁄2 teaspoons dark soy sauce

**•** 1 tablespoon light soy sauce

**•** 5 fluid ounces red sauce (from marinating the pork)

**•** 5 fluid ounces of water

**•** 1 teaspoon tapioca starch (optional, for thickening the sauce, mix with water)

**Instructions**

**1.** Crush garlic and coriander root with a mortar and pestle.

**2.** In a large mixing bowl, combine the garlic &amp; coriander root mixture, Chinese five spice powder, white pepper, palm sugar, sesame oil, oyster sauce, light soy sauce, and tapioca starch. Add the food coloring and thoroughly mix one more time.

**3.** Add pork and coat each part with the sauce. Marinate in your refrigerator overnight. (Keep the marinade sauce – don’t discard it!!)

**4.** There are two cooking methods for the pork:

1. Use an air fryer; place the meat in a single layer and cook at 320°F / 160°C, then flip andcook the other side for 5 more minutes. This is the method I like best.
2. Grill over charcoal until the pork is fully cooked, flip occasionally to prevent burning.Alternatively, you can use a grilling pan.

**5.** After cooking it, we’ll let the meat rest for a few minutes before slicing, this will increase its tenderness and allows the juices to spread evenly. Meanwhile, we can make the sauce.

Add palm sugar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, dark soy sauce, and light soy sauce into the leftover marinade sauce and mix thoroughly.

**6.** Move the sauce to a pot or wok over medium heat. Once it starts bubbling, pour in water. If the sauce isn’t your desired thickness, consider mixing the optional tapioca starch with 5 fl oz of water. Add gradually and stir until it’s just right.

**7.** Slice the pork against the grain into long strips. Serve immediately. Scoop a portion of rice onto a plate, top with red pork slices, and drizzle with red sauce.

Recipe: [Chinese Braised King Trumpet Mushrooms](https://cookingtoentertain.com/chinese-braised-king-trumpet-mushrooms-recipe/)

## *Ingredients*

• 400 grams King Trumpet Mushrooms also called king oyster, French horn, eryngi, boletus of the steppes and more

• 250 ml Chicken Stock

• 4 tbsp Butter or Neutral Oil I like butter with mushrooms but oil is more traditional

• 6 cloves Garlic minced

• 1.5 tbsp Oyster Sauce

• 1 tbsp Dark Soy Sauce

• 1.5 tsp Dou Ban Jiang this is a Chinese spicy bean paste. If you can't find it at your local market you can buy it online. You can also substitute in some gochujang instead although the flavor is slightly different

• 2 tsp Corn Starch

• 1/2 tsp MSG

• Spring Onion chopped, for garnish

## *Instructions*

1. In a bowl whisk together the chicken stock, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, dou ban jiang, corn starch, and MSG. Set Aside.

2. Cut the stem of the king trumpet mushrooms into medallions about 6 cm thick (more or less is fine, use your best judgement). Then use a sharp knife to make a cross hatch pattern on one of the surfaces, going down no more than a centimeter.

3. Set a pan on medium-high heat and add your butter or oil. Place your mushrooms down and let them brown before flipping. Cook on both sides until nicely browned. Make sure they end up with the cross hatch pattern facing up.

4. Add the garlic to the pan and quickly fry it for no more than 15 seconds. Then pour in the chicken stock mix. Let the sauce heat up and thicken. While this is happening spoon the sauce over the mushrooms so it gets in all the cuts. When the sauce is thickened turn off the heat and plate.

I love cooking and sharing my recipes with all foodlover ;-)

This is my Basil Olive Oil. It is perfect on tomato bruschetta, salads, spaghetti with tomato sauce or to season vegetables and various pasta dishes.

[Here the original link to the video ;-) If you need more help ask me](https://youtu.be/YO-Igyb2Ijw)

**RECIPE**

* Fresh basil 100gr
* EV Olive Oil 250ml
* Salt to taste
* Garlic to taste (I used just a little piece)

**Procedure:**

1. Sterilize a glass bottle in boiling water (pay attention to the capacity), let it dry well. We will use it to bottle the basil oil
2. Whash the basil
3. In a saucepan, boil the water and add the salt. Cook the basil for about 2 minutes
4. Put the basil in a bowl of cold water and ice for 1-2 minutes, then dry it well with paper towels
5. Blend the basil with oil, garlic and a little salt (3-4 minutes at maximum speed)
6. Filter with a colander (the narrower the screen, the clearer and more intense the color of the oil will be)
7. Store for 4-5 weeks max in a cool place away from light

PAY attention: I keep My basil oil 3 months and more, the last month I keep it in the refrigerator, but being homemade it is better to use a lot of precaution to prevent botox and bacteria, so point 7 I suggested you to keep it only for few weeks.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15241la/basil_olive_oil_recipe_by_vito_chef_salerno_italy/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15241la/basil_olive_oil_recipe_by_vito_chef_salerno_italy/

* 8 ounces baby bella mushrooms trimmed, wiped clean, and thinly sliced
* 5 scallions minced; white and green parts separated; reserve a pinch of scallion greens for garnish
* 1 small yellow onion peeled and small-diced
* 1 green bell pepper trimmed, seeded, and small-diced
* 2 small carrots trimmed, peeled, and small-diced
* ¼ cup light soy sauce or use low-sodium soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 2 tablespoons mushroom soaking water
* 1 teaspoon minced ginger
* Pinch of white pepper, optional
* Pinch of crushed red pepper
* Salt to taste

**Prepare the mushrooms:**

1. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Turn off the heat and add the mushrooms. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and dice them.

**Prepare the vegetables:**

1. Dice all of the vegetables needed for the fried rice. Place the baby bella mushrooms in one bowl and combine the white parts of the scallions, the yellow onion, bell pepper, and carrots in a bowl.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Combine soy sauce, sesame oil, 2 tablespoons mushroom soaking water, minced ginger, white pepper, and crushed red pepper in a bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside.

**Make the fried rice:**

1. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sliced baby bella mushrooms and cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes until golden brown.

Serves: 4 Calories per serving: 409 Cook time: About 50–55 mins

**Creamed corn:**

* 4 ears corn, shucked and cut from the cob
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 shallot, peeled and diced
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon flour
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* Pinch of cayenne, optional
* 1¼ cup whole milk
* ¼ cup heavy cream

* ¼ teaspoon cayenne powder
* 2 teaspoons neutral oil
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes
* 2 tablespoons butter
* ½ lemon, juiced
* ¼ cup fresh parsley, minced; plus more for serving
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prepare the shrimp:**

1. Place the shrimp in a large bowl and pat dry with paper towels. Season with salt, pepper, Aleppo pepper flakes, and cayenne powder. Toss to coat and refrigerate until needed.

**Make the creamed corn:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the shallot and cook for 4-5 minutes until softened.
2. Add the corn and cook for 5–7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Melt the butter into the corn and add the flour, paprika, and cayenne. Cook, stirring to coat the corn in the flour, for about 1–2 minutes.
4. Pour in the milk, stirring constantly as you pour, until the flour is incorporated and the sauce is smooth. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally as it cooks to prevent sticking. Add more milk as needed if the liquid evaporates too quickly.
5. After 15 minutes, stir in the cream. Taste and season. If you like, use an immersion blender and blend half the mixture. Simmer for 5 minutes more. The sauce should be thick, and the corn should be creamy and tender.

**Cook the shrimp:**

1. In a large skillet, heat the neutral oil over medium-high until hot. Add the cherry tomatoes and cook for 5–7 minutes, turning often, until the skins split and the tomatoes begin to burst. Lightly break a few of them open with your spoon. 
2. Melt the butter into the tomatoes and season them with salt and pepper.
3. Add the shrimp to the tomatoes and immediately spread them into an even layer.
4. Cook for 2–3 minutes per side until almost opaque. The cooking time will depend on the size of the shrimp. Turn off the heat and stir in the parsley and lemon juice. Let stand in the hot skillet for a minute or two to allow the residual heat to finish cooking the shrimp.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the corn into shallow bowls and pile the shrimp on top. Spoon any sauce from the skillet over the shrimp. Garnish with more parsley and a pinch of Aleppo pepper flakes.

## **INGREDIENTS**
  
• 400 grams Rigatoni Pasta I suggest getting a quality brand that has quite thick walls, like something trafilata en bronzo.

• 3 tbsp Olive Oil

• 1 medium Yellow Onion finely diced

• 2 cloves Garlic thinly sliced

• 7 Calabrian Chilies these are absolutely a necessary ingredient so try your best to find them.

• 250 grams Tomato Paste this is about a cup of the jarred stuff. The super concentrated paste in those metal tubes will be far too much.

• 1 cup Vodka

• 360 ml Heavy Cream as you can see I used 33% heavy cream. I would not recommend going below that.

• 50 grams Butter about 3 tbsp or in America a little less than half a stick.

• Salt for the pasta water

• 1 tsp Black Pepper freshly cracked. If using powdered black pepper then a half teaspoon will be fine.

• Parmigiano Reggiano to taste

• Basil for garnish


## **INSTRUCTIONS**
 
1. Start boiling a pot of heavily salted water. Heat up some oil in a pan on medium heat. Add the onion and stir until somewhat translucent. Add in the Calabrian chili and garlic and continue stirring for another minute or so.
2. Add the tomato paste and stir it around to mix with the other stuff in the pan, then pour in the vodka. Stir the vodka around and let everything reduce a bit, about 3-5 minutes. Here you can add the pasta to the boiling salted water and cook until al dente.
3. Next add in the butter and chili flakes and stir until the butter is fully melted, then pour in the cream. Stir the pan around until well combined, then lower the heat to low.
When the pasta is ready, about 2 minutes less than what the box will usually say, remove a cup of water from the pot. Set aside. Drain the pasta and add the rigatoni right to the sauce. 4. Give everything a mix and re-add the reserved water to the pan about a quarter cup at a time until you reach desired consistency. You don't need to use all of the water.
5. Plate the pasta, grate over some good quality Parmigiano Reggiano, and sprinkle over some basil chiffonade. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/14s7wy9/carbones_spicy_rigatoni_copycat/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/14s7wy9/carbones_spicy_rigatoni_copycat/

14ogock,Chinese Walnut Chicken,208,7,1688278046.0,0.95,Recipe,CookingToEntertain,https://i.redd.it/dlhgix6fth9b1.jpg,"Hi all, here's my (friend's father's) recipe for one of my favorite dishes when I lived in China. 

[Chinese Walnut Chicken Recipe](https://cookingtoentertain.com/chinese-walnut-chicken-recipe/)

## **Ingredients**

• 2 Chicken Thighs Chopped into bite size pieces

• 1 cup Walnuts toasted 

• 200 grams Mushrooms white button, quartered

• 100 grams Sugar (1/2 cup )white, granulated

• 2 tsp Light Soy Sauce

• 1 tsp Dark Soy Sauce

• 1 tbsp Chinese Rice Wine I used MiJiu which is sweetened, but you can use any style you prefer

• 1 tsp Potato Starch

• 75 grams Peas (1/2 cup) can be canned, frozen, or fresh

• 1 tbsp Hoisin Sauce

• 1 tsp Sesame Oil 

• 1 tbsp Neutral Oil like soybean, sunflower, canola, etc


## **Instructions**

1. In a saucepan on medium high heat add the sugar and allow to caramelize. You don't need to touch it. Once it is just caramelized add in all the walnuts and stir/toss the pan around so all the walnuts are coated. Pour the contents in one layer onto a sheet of parchment paper and let cool.

2. In a bowl add the chicken pieces along with the soy sauces, rice wine, and potato starch. Mix everything up and let sit while you cook the mushrooms.

3. Back in the pan add the oil and put the heat on medium high. When hot add in the quartered mushrooms and let cook. It's hard to overcook mushrooms so you don't need to worry with the pan too much. I let them brown on the edges and toss the pan every minute or so. After the mushrooms are sufficiently browned add the bowl of chicken and the marinade.

4. As soon as you add the chicken and marinade to the pan start stirring/tossing the pan. The chicken will only take 2-3 minutes to cook. While the chicken is cooking you can break up the walnuts.

5. Take the parchment paper with the walnuts on it and roll it up into a ball. Smack the ball on the countertop a few times to break up the walnuts fused together with the sugar. Add the walnuts to the pan.

[Loco Moco Recipe](https://cookingtoentertain.com/loco-moco-hawaiian-recipe/)

# **Loco Moco Ingredients** (for four servings)

## **Burger**

• 500 grams Ground Beef (I use a standard 80/20 but you can go leaner if you prefer since the gravy has tons of fat in it anyways).

• 1 tsp Salt

• 1/2 tsp MSG

• 1 tsp Garlic Powder

• 1 tsp Worcestershire Sauce

• 1/2 tsp Black Pepper (freshly cracked)

## **Brown Gravy**

• 500 ml Chicken Stock (if salted, you shouldn’t need to add extra salt. If unsalted adjust salt to taste)

• 250 grams Mushrooms (I use King Oyster mushrooms, but you can use whichever ones you prefer)

• 1 Yellow Onion (diced)

• 2 tsp Soy Sauce

• 1 tbsp Ketchup

• 3 Anchovy Fillets

• 1 tbsp Corn Starch (or more if needed)

• 3 tbsp Butter

• Black Pepper (freshly cracked, to taste)

• Oil (as needed. I use sunflower oil but you can use any neutral oil you prefer)

## **Other**

• White Rice (as needed)

• Green Onion (chopped, for garnish)

• Red Chili Pepper (thinly sliced, for garnish)

• Fried Eggs

 * * *

# **Instructions**

1. You can make your rice ahead of time, and the eggs and garnishes at the end.    


2. Add all the burger ingredients to a large bowl and mash everything together with your hands until you have a nice homogenous mix. Cover bowl and place in fridge.    


3. Place your pan on medium-high heat and add a good amount of oil. Add in your sliced mushrooms and let fry until slightly browned. Add in the diced onion and stir until the onion is translucent or browned.    


4. Add in the chicken stock, ketchup, soy sauce, and anchovy fillets and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and let simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.    


5. Mix the corn starch with a quarter or half cup of water and add the slurry into the gravy. Stir it around and let thicken for just a couple minutes, Take off the heat and move the gravy to another bowl. Add in the butter and stir it around until the butter is melted and incorporated. Add freshly cracked black pepper to taste.    


6. Take the hamburger mix out of the fridge and form it into balls or patties.    


7. Get your pan back up to medium-high heat and place down the meat. Cook until done and then turn off the heat.    


8. While the meat is cooking you can prepare the loco moco bowls. Lay down some rice as a base, then when the hamburger is done place that on top. Spoon over the brown gravy. Finally quickly fry an egg sunny side up and place that right on top. You can add more brown gravy on top of the egg if you like, otherwise you can sprinkle with chopped scallions and chili peppers, or whatever other garnishes you prefer.

Lemme tell ya.. It depends. 
Been in South Louisiana all my life and different rouxs are preferred in different areas. 
Some people think a dark roux is the ""proper"" way but that's not true. 
True ""Cajun"" chicken and sausage gumbo has a light and thin roux. Almost like a soup. Most true Cajuns I know do not like dark rouxs. 
New Orleans is where the dark roux is preferred. 
And then for a seafood gumbo it's dark roux all around usually. 
The amount of time it takes you to make a roux from scratch on the stove just depends on how high your heat is.. A lot of Cajuns will sit there on a roux for an hour or more and still have a light roux. 

This looks pretty decent. My only criticism would be the meat to liquid ratio is off, but that's all preference.

* Heavy cream - 400ml


* Sugar - 40g


* Unflavored gelatin powder - 1 tsp


* Vanilla extract - 1 tsp


* Hot water - 2 tbsp




**Second Layer:**


* Fresh strawberries - 450g


* Sugar - 30g


* Unflavored gelatin powder - 1 tsp


* Hot water - 1 tbsp

**Instructions:**


**Step 1: Preparing the First Layer**


1. Start by adding the gelatin to 2 tablespoons of hot water and let it swell for a few minutes.


2. In a pot, pour the heavy cream and add the sugar.


3. Once the gelatin has bloomed, add it to the pot with the heavy cream and sugar.


4. Place the pot on low heat and stir for about 5 minutes to allow the gelatin and sugar to dissolve completely.


5. Remove the pot from the heat and let the mixture cool down slightly.


6. Pour the creamy mixture into transparent glasses, filling them about halfway.


7. Cover the glasses with plastic wrap or lids to prevent the surface of the panna cotta from drying.


8. Place the glasses in the refrigerator and let them chill for 2-4 hours, or until the first layer solidifies.

11. Add the sugar and 2 tablespoons of water to the pot with the strawberries.


12. Place the pot over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally for 7 minutes. This will help release the juices from the strawberries and dissolve the sugar.


13. Add the bloomed gelatin to the pot and continue to boil for another minute, stirring constantly.


14. Remove the pot from the heat and let the strawberry mixture cool for a few minutes.


15. Transfer the strawberry mixture to a blender and blend until smooth.

13wrgiu,Prosciutto Bread,101,8,1685551707.0,0.95,Recipe,msuts,https://i.redd.it/43234f8km83b1.jpg,"#PROSCIUTTO BREAD
*Yield: 2 loaves*

**Ingredients:**

* 16 ½ oz bread flour
* 1 ½ tsp instant or rapid-rise yeast
* 1 tsp table salt
* 1 cup mild lager, room temp (such as Budweiser)
* 6 tbsp water, room temperature
* 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 5 oz mild provolone cheese, cut into thick ½” pieces
* 9 oz assorted cured Italian meats (prosciutto, capicola, pepperoni, mortadella, etc), cut into rough ¼” to ½” pieces
* ½ tbsp coarsely ground black pepper
* Cornmeal

**Procedure:**

1. *Make the dough:* Whisk flour, yeast, and salt together in bowl of stand mixer. Whisk beer, room-temperature water, and oil together in 2-cup liquid measuring cup.

2. *Knead the dough:* Fit mixer with dough hook. Mix flour mixture on low speed while slowly adding beer mixture until cohesive dough starts to form and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl, about 8 minutes.

3. *Add meat and cheese:* Reduce speed to low and add provolone, prosciutto, pepperoni, capicola, and pepper. Continue to knead until combined, about 2 minutes longer (some meats and cheese may not be fully incorporated into dough at this point; this is OK). Transfer dough and any errant pieces of meats and cheese to lightly floured counter and knead by hand to evenly incorporate meats and cheese into dough, about 1 minute.
4. *Let dough rise:* Form dough into smooth, round ball and place seam side down in lightly greased large bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let dough rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1½ hours.
5. *Separate into two pieces:* Line baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust with cornmeal. Turn out dough onto counter and gently press down to deflate any large air pockets. Cut dough into 2 even pieces. Press each piece of dough into 8 by 5-inch rectangle with long side parallel to counter's edge.
6. *Shape and second rise:* Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, fold top edge of rectangle down to midline, pressing to seal. Fold bottom edge of rectangle up to midline and pinch to seal. Flip dough seam side down and gently roll into 12-inch loaf with tapered ends. Transfer loaf to 1 side of prepared sheet. Repeat shaping with second piece of dough and place loaf about 3 inches from first loaf on sheet. Cover with greased plastic and let rise at room temperature until puffy and dough springs back slowly when pressed lightly with your finger, about 45 minutes.
7. *Bake:* Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Using sharp paring knife in swift, fluid motion, make ½-inch-deep lengthwise slash along top of each loaf, starting and stopping about 1½ inches from ends. Bake until loaves register 205 to 210 degrees, 22 to 25 minutes. Transfer loaves to wire rack and let cool completely before serving, about 3 hours. To store, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate, allowing to reach room temperature before serving again. This bread freezes excellently and can be thawed in the oven without issue.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13wrgiu/prosciutto_bread/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13wrgiu/prosciutto_bread/

# Equipment

* 1 6 qt Instant Pot

# Ingredients

* 3 lbs beef rough flank
* 2 lbs Chinese daikon
* 6 cloves garlic (smashed)
* 2 stalks scallion (cut into 3 inch pieces)
* 3 small shallots (quartered)
* 1 inch ginger (sliced into thin pieces)
* ½ cup Shaoxing wine
* 3 tablespoon light soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
* 5 bay leaves
* 4 star anise
* 1 dried orange peel
* 1 cup low sodium chicken stock
* 3 tablespoon cornstarch (mixed with 4 tablespoon of water)
* Salt (to taste)

# Instructions

1. Pat the beef dry. Set the Instant Pot to 'Sauté' and wait for the pot screen to read 'Hot'. This can take a couple minutes. Add a neutral oil and then the meat. Sear both sides - this will take a couple batches. Even with the oil, you may find that the meat may stick a bit to the pot. Let it sear undisturbed and it will release much more easily.
2. Remove the meat and add the aromatics to the pot with some oil. Stir-fry until fragrant which should take about 2 minutes.
3. Add the meat back into the pot with light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine sugar, and oyster sauce. Stir to evenly distribute the sauce. Then add bay leaves, star anise, and dried orange peel.
4. Add daikon to the IP. Use a spatula to move the daikon towards the bottom of the pot so there's a better chance for the daikon to soak up the sauce. Finally, add the chicken stock.
5. Secure the lid on the IP. Set IP to Pressure Cook for 10 minutes. Let pot Natural Release.
6. Once you can remove the lid safely, set the pot back into Sauté mode. Add cornstarch mixture (pre-mix this in a separate bowl before adding into the IP) and allow the ingredients to simmer until the sauce thickens. Let simmer for another 5 minutes to slightly reduce the sauce.
7. Taste and add salt to your preference.

I don’t have a smoker so I do mine fattiest side up in a covered Dutch oven or a roasting pan sealed with tinfoil around 300 degrees in a regular oven for however long until a metal skewer passes through easily and the meat is pulling away from the bone.  Usually around three hours then I start checking. Total time really depends on the size.   

If you want to reduce the fat in the meat on the bottom of the roast then place a sturdy rack in the bottom of the pan so up an inch or so. 

Most of mine I have done with salt and pepper as well as a can of spicy V8 poured over it.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 piece of large cabbage or 2 medium-sized ones
* 300 grams of ground beef or lamb, or a combination of both
* 2 cups of short-grain rice
* 1/2 teaspoon of seven spice
* 1/2 tablespoon of salt
* 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon
* 1 tablespoon of tomato concentrate
* 2 cups of water, plus 2 teaspoons of salt, and 1 lemon
* 1/4 cup of regular olive oil
* 2 to 3 tablespoons of pomegranate molasses
* 1 peeled bulb of garlic
* 1/2 teaspoon of dried mint
* Boiling water for blanching

**Directions:**

1. Separating the cabbage leaves slowly and carefully, ensuring not to rip them, take batches at a time and add them into a pot of boiling water.
2. Simmer the blend for about 5 minutes until the ingredients become soft, and then set aside.
3. When the leaves have cooled, cut off the thick stems and distribute them at the bottom of the pot. Subsequently, tear each large leaf into halves – making sure that each piece does not exceed your hand size.
4. Combine ground meat, rice, seven spice, black pepper, cinnamon, tomato concentrate, salt, and ¼ cup regular olive oil in a mixing bowl. Mix well and place on the table.
5. On a large plate, spread out a cabbage leaf as flat as possible.
6. Start with the stuffing, around two tablespoons should do. Shape it into a cigar shape at the bottom of the cabbage leaf. Finally, just roll it up and your stuffed cabbage is ready to go!
7. Spread the slices of roughly chopped garlic throughout the cabbage rolls as you peel an entire bulb.
8. Mix together 2 cups of water, 2 tsp of salt, and the juice from a whole lemon to create a brine.
9. Once the rolling of the cabbage leaves is complete, put a heatproof plate on top and add the brine water to it.
10. Bring the brine water to a boil on high heat for 20 minutes. Determine if the lemon and salt levels need adjustment by tasting the liquid.
11. Once the plate has been removed, reduce the heat to medium-low and add a drizzle of olive oil and pomegranate molasses. Lastly, a pinch of dried mint should be added. This will round off the ingredients, creating a complex and interesting flavor.
12. Cover the skillet, and simmer for another hour until the cabbage leaves are tender.

13c2xyf,Lilac Whipped Cream,572,23,1683576000.0,0.97,Recipe,HungryEnoughToEatSix,https://i.redd.it/ge7b3hqtfpya1.jpg,"INGREDIENTS:

• 3 sprigs clean, washed Lilac flowers (three 4-inch to 5-inch conical sprigs of lilac flowers)


• 1 cup whipping cream (heavy cream will also work)


• ½ cup confectioner's sugar


• Optional: extra lilac flowers for garnishing


DIRECTIONS
 
1. Tuck the lilac blooms into a jar or container. (Snip the lilacs into shorter pieces if you need to.) Pour the cream into the jar over the lilacs. 


2. Use a spoon to push the lilacs down to completely submerge them. Cover the jar and refrigerate the cream for 24 hours.


3. Pop the bowl and whisk attachment (or a mixing bowl and beaters from a hand mixer) into the freezer - do this at least 15 minutes before making the whipped cream.


4. Place a small strainer over a bowl, and pour the cream through the strainer to remove the lilacs. Press down on the lilacs with your hand to squeeze out excess cream that's hiding out in the flowers. Discard the lilacs.



5. Assemble the bowl and whisk onto your stand mixer. Pour the infused cream into the bowl and beat it on high speed for about 1 minute. 


6. Pause the mixer, pour in the confectioner's sugar, and resume beating the cream on high speed. It should take between 2 and 5 more minutes for the cream to firm up and form peaks.



7. Serve the whipped cream with your dessert or drink right away, and add a few lilac flowers as a garnish if you wish.



8. Store leftover whipped cream in a covered container for up to three days. Makes about two cups of whipped cream.



NOTES
1.  Choose vibrant lilac blooms that have just opened and that aren't yet turning brown. A few unopened buds are okay. You will get the best flavor from sprigs that have just bloomed.


2. Lilac blooms grow in cone-shaped clusters. You want three of these clusters for this recipe.



3. Give your lilac blooms a gentle wash under cool, running water to rinse off any critters or dust. Gently shake out as much of the waters as you can, and pick off any dead leaves or shriveled petals.

12. **Slowly pour about 1 to 2 cups of water in bottom of pan and add ¼ cup of wine (wine is optional).** 
13. **Be careful not to pour water on top of peppers only between them. Use only enough liquid to cover the bottom of the pan (the purpose is to create a moisture for peppers to continue softening.)**
14. **Cover loosely with aluminum foil and bake for about 30 to 40 minutes at 375F.**
15. **About 10 minutes before finishing, uncover, top with provolone slices and basil and bake until cheese is melted.**
16. **ENJOY!!**

• 12 ounces dry corkscrew or elbow pasta



• 1 pound boneless chicken breast



• 1½ teaspoons salt



• ½ teaspoon black pepper

 

• 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice



• 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil



• 3 large yellow bell peppers



• 1 pound fresh asparagus



• ½ cup fresh basil leaves



• 1 cup crumbled goat cheese



• ½ cup extra virgin olive oil



• ½ cup lemon juice



• ¼ cup sour cream



• 1 tablespoon white vinegar



• 1 teaspoon dijon mustard



• ¾ teaspoon salt



• ½ teaspoon black pepper



DIRECTIONS



1. Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Rinse the pasta under cold water until it is completely cool. Pour the pasta into a large bowl and hold it aside. 



2. Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally. Season both sides with 1½ teaspoons of salt and ½ teaspoon of black pepper.



3. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot place the chicken pieces in the pan. Cook the chicken for about 3-4 minutes until there is some browning on that first side. Flip the chicken pieces over and reduce the heat to very low.



4. Add in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice over the chicken and cover the pan. Let the chicken sit in the pan over low heat for 20 minutes. The pieces should be cooked through by this time. Remove the pan from the heat and let the chicken cool.



5. When cool enough to handle, slice the chicken into cubes and add them to the bowl with the pasta. 




6. While the chicken cooks, prepare the veggies: Slice the tops and bottoms off the bell peppers and discard the tops and the seeds and membranes from inside. Slice the peppers into small pieces. Add these to the bowl with the pasta. 



7. Wash the asparagus and snap off the ends. If the stalks are very thick, use a vegetable peeler to peel the bottoms of the stalks.



8. In a medium skillet add enough water for a depth of ¼-inch. Heat the water to a simmer and add in the asparagus. Cover the pan and steam the asparagus for 3-5 minutes until it is just tender.



9. Remove the asparagus from the water and run the stalks under cold water until they are cool. Slice the asparagus into small pieces and add them to the bowl. 



10. Rinse and dry the basil leaves, then tear them into small pieces and add them to the bowl.




11. Place the following into a jar that has a tight-fitting lid: the ½ cup of olive oil, the ½ cup of lemon juice, the sour cream, vinegar, mustard, the ¾ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Close the jar and shake the dressing vigorously to blend it.  




12. Pour the dressing over everything in the bowl and stir the salad together with a large spoon. All ingredients should be well mixed and coated with the dressing. 

  

13. Spoon the salad into serving bowls and top each bowl with some of the crumbled goat cheese. Serve the salad immediately. Makes about 8 cups.

12ycr28,Chicken meatballs in creamy sauce. It’s a delicious dish that can be prepared in a short amount of time,64,5,1682410677.0,0.91,Recipe,Destiny_town,https://i.redd.it/v20un2ryozva1.jpg,"Hello friends!

Today, I’m sharing my recipe for chicken meatballs with cream sauce. It’s a delicious dish that can be prepared in a short amount of time. [Original recipe](https://grillmangal.art/en/chicken-meatballs-in-creamy-sauce/)

**Ingredients**

* 700 g ground chicken
* 50 g white bread (crumb)
* 50 ml milk
* 120 g onion (1 medium onion)
* 1 tsp salt (6 g)
* 1/2 tsp black pepper (1.5 g)
* 1/2 tsp oregano
* 50 g butter
* 100 ml 20% cream
* 100 ml chicken broth
* 3-4 tbsp sunflower oil (for frying)

**Cooking process**

1. Finely chop the onion.
2. Heat a frying pan, add 1 tbsp sunflower oil and put the finely chopped onion here.
3. Fry until soft, stirring so it doesn’t burn. Over medium heat.
4. Crumble the white bread and pour in 50 ml of milk, let it stand for 5-7 minutes to soak well.
5. Put the ground meat in a bowl where we will knead it, make a recess and put the onion there, add the bread with the milk. Instead of ground meat, you can take chicken breast and finely chop it. As I usually do.
6. Add salt, pepper. You can also add various spices, such as turmeric, oregano, etc. I don’t add them to this recipe.
7. Mix the meat mixture thoroughly.
8. The amount of meat and other ingredients is not just for nothing) I make meatballs of approximately 80 grams each, 12 pieces in total, and that’s exactly how many fit in a 32 cm diameter frying pan.
9. Divide the meat mixture into equal pieces, make balls out of them. Do not roll them too hard, so they don’t become too dense inside.
10. Heat the same frying pan where you fried the onion. Add all the sunflower oil, 2-3 tbsp.
11. Add 50 g of butter to the same frying pan.
12. As soon as the butter melts and starts sizzling, place our meatballs in the frying pan.
13. Put them on the edges of the pan, the center will come in handy.
14. Fry until golden brown (usually 2-3 minutes) on one side, turn over to the other. All this is done over high heat.
15. Fry for a couple of minutes, make sure that a crust has formed on the other side as well, reduce the heat to medium.
16. In the center of the pan, sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of oregano, mix, let the aroma develop.
17. Pour 100 ml of broth into a pan, you can use ready-made broths, but you need to carefully look at their composition (how much salt, spices, etc.).
18. Add cream.
19. Stir the resulting sauce in the middle of the pan.
20. Cook for another 7-8 minutes and turn off.
21. The dish is ready.

And that’s the whole recipe!

Serves 2. Double ingredients for 4 servings.

Ingredients:

• 1 lb top sirloin steak, thinly sliced into strips

• 2 Tbsp olive oil

• 2 Tbsp unsalted butter

• 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped

• 1/2 lIb brown mushrooms, thickly sliced

• 1 garlic cloves, minced

• 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour

• 1 cup beef broth

• 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream

• 1/4 cup sour cream

• 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce

• 1/2 tsp dijon mustard

• 1/2 tsp salt

• 1/4 tsp black pepper

(To serve)

• 1 Tbsp green onion, to garnish

• 8-12 oz egg noodles, to serve

Instructions: 

1. Place a large deep pan or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 2 Tbsp oil and once oil is very hot, add thinly sliced beef strips in a single layer, cooking 1 minute per side without stirring.
Cook until just browned and no longer red. Sear beef in 2 batches so you don't overcrowd the pan.
Remove beef to a plate and cover to keep warm.

2. Add 2 Tbsp butter, chopped onion and sliced mushrooms. Sautee 6-8 minutes or until liquid has evaporated and onions and mushrooms are soft and lightly browned.

3. Add 1 minced garlic clove and sautee 1 minute until fragrant. Add 1 Tbsp flour and sautee another minute stirring constantly.

4. Pour in 1 cups beef broth, scraping any bits from the bottom of the pan then add 3/4 cup whipping cream and simmer another 1 to 2 minutes or until slightly thickened.

5. Stir a few Tablespoons of the sauce into 1/4 cup of sour cream to temper it so the sour cream doesn't curdle then add it to the pan while stirring constantly.

6. Stir in 1 Tbsp Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp dijon mustard, and season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper, or season to taste and continue simmering until sauce is creamy. Add beef with any accumulated juices back to the pan and bring just to a simmer or until beef is heated through.

Personal notes: While searing the sirloin strips, I lightly season it with salt and pepper, which adds more flavor to the beef. Rather than using 1/2 tsp salt in the sauce, I add just a couple dashes salt and pepper",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12x0998/creamy_beef_stroganoff/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12x0998/creamy_beef_stroganoff/

* 1 yellow onion, peeled and finely diced
* 1 hot pepper, such as jalapeño or cherry pepper, trimmed and finely minced
* 1 small red bell pepper, trimmed, seeded, and finely diced
* 7-ounce can tomato paste
* 1–2 tablespoons chili powder
* 2 teaspoons cumin
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* ½ teaspoon cayenne powder, more or less to taste
* ½ teaspoon turmeric
* 12-ounce jar Heinz chili sauce or use ½ cup ketchup
* Salt, pepper, and sugar if needed

**Brown the beef:**

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon for 15–20 minutes until browned and cooked through. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Transfer the cooked beef to a paper towel-lined plate and discard all but 2 teaspoons of fat in the skillet.

1. Return the skillet to the stove over medium heat. Add the onion and both diced peppers and cook until softened, about 5–7 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
2. Add the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne powder, paprika, and turmeric. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and mash it into the skillet. Cook for 1–3 minutes until it deepens in color.
3. Return the beef to the pot and toss to combine.

1. Serve the hot dog sauce on top of your favorite hot dog. Be sure to warm the buns first! I like to microwave them so they’re soft, but toast or grill them if you prefer.

**Ingredients**  
	•	2 cups Masa Harina (Masa Flour)  
	•	1.5 cup Water  
	•	1/4 tsp Kosher Salt  


**Instructions**  
	1.	In a medium bowl, combine the masa harina, water and salt and mix well. Continue adding water 1 tbsp at a time until you have formed a soft smooth and thick dough that has the consistency of cookie dough.  
	2.	Form 12 golf ball-sized balls and lay a moist dish towel over them so they don't dry out.  
	3.	Warm an ungreased comal or nonstick skillet over medium heat.  
	4.	Lay a pre cut sheet of plastic on the bottom of the tortilla press and place a ball of masa on top of the plastic. Place a second sheet of plastic on top of the ball and then squeeze the press firmly so that the dough is sandwiched between the two plates. Open the press and remove the flattened masa, which will be stuck between the two sheets of plastic. Place it on your left palm and use your right hand to peel off the top sheet of plastic. Then flip it over and transfer it to your right hand, so that it rests in your right palm. Carefully peel off the other sheet of plastic, freeing the raw tortilla.  
	5.	Gently place the raw tortilla on the preheated skillet. Watch for the edge of the tortilla to begin turning opaque, a signal that it is cooking. When this happens, flip to the other side and let it cook for 30 to 45 more seconds. Using the bottom of a pancake flipper, gently press down on the tortilla until you hear it squeal. Flip it back to the first side and let it cook for a final 30 seconds. After the second flip, it should start to puff up, a sign that all of the water in the masa has evaporated and the tortilla is done.  
	6.	As each tortilla is finished cooking, set it in a basket or a deep bowl and cover the growing stack with a dish towel to keep them warm.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12rreji/homemade_mexican_tortillas_de_maiz/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12rreji/homemade_mexican_tortillas_de_maiz/

**Instructions**  
	1.	In a bowl, whisk the eggs, sour cream and salt until well combined.  
	2.	Warm the oil in a nonstick pan over high heat until it is hot but not smoking. Drop a piece of tortilla into the oil and listen for a sizzle. When you hear it, add the rest of the tortillas and stir them with a wooden spoon. They will soften as they soak up oil, and then turn crispy. Right after this happens, discard the excess oil and turn the heat to low.  
	3.	Add the egg mixture to the pan and scramble together with the fried tortillas. Taste and add more salt if needed. Serve immediately, topped with salsa, sliced avocado, and chopped cilantro.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 lb of boneless and skinless chicken breasts cut into strips
* 1 lb of boneless and skinless chicken thighs
* ¼ cup of olive oil
* 3 tbsp of lemon juice 
* 6 minced garlic cloves
* 2 tsp of salt 
* 1 tsp of paprika 
* ¾ tsp of cardamom 
* ¾ tsp of cumin 
* ¼ tsp of crushed red pepper 
* ¼ tsp of cinnamon

**Directions:**

1. To make this chicken dish, start by mixing the marinade in a ziplock bag or container. If using a container, you may need to increase the marinade by 50%.
2. Add the chicken to the marinade and massage it from the outside to coat it well. Place the bag or container in the fridge to marinate for at least 3 hours, or up to 24 hours.
3. When you're ready to cook the chicken, you can do it on the stove or on a BBQ. The spices in the marinade will give the chicken a nice crust and a delicious aroma.
4. After cooking the chicken, let it rest for at least 3 minutes before slicing or serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute throughout the flesh, rather than running out when you cut into the meat.
5. To serve, place the chicken, lettuce, tomato slices, onion, yogurt sauce, and flatbreads on a platter. Allow everyone to make their own wraps with the ingredients. If the chicken is larger, you may want to slice it. If it is smaller, you can leave it whole.

**Ingredients:**

* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup warm water
* 1/4 cup milk
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup honey
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 tablespoon warm water
* Sesame seeds, for garnish

**Directions:**

1. Dissolve the yeast in 1/4 cup warm water and allow approximately 5 minutes for it to become frothy. This can be done by placing the mixture in a small bowl.
2. In the same mixing bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder carefully until blended.
3. Mix together the yeast mixture, milk, vegetable oil, and egg in a bowl to create a soft dough.
4. Knead the dough for approximately 5-7 minutes, turning it out onto a floured surface, until its texture becomes smooth and elastic.
5. Cover the dough in a greased bowl using a damp cloth, and place in a warm spot. Allow it to rest for an hour - or until it's doubled in size.
6. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
7. Melt the butter and honey in a small saucepan over low heat, then remove from the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon of warm water. The process concludes with a fully-blended mix of butter, honey, and water.
8. Divide the dough into small portions equivalent in size to a golf ball; you will usually get between 16-18 balls.
9. Roll the dough balls into 6-inch-long ropes.
10. Take each rope, fold it in half, and create a spiral shape like a beehive. Twist the rope around itself and pinch the end to seal it.
11. Using parchment paper to line a baking sheet, position the beehive buns in a way that leaves an adequate amount of space between each one.
12. Glaze each bun with the honey butter, then top them off with a sprinkle of sesame seeds.
13. Preheat the oven, then put the buns in to bake for 15-20 minutes or until they reach a golden-brown color.
14. Remove the buns from the oven when done cooking and set them on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes.

This enticing smoked salmon toast, accompanied by delicate soft-boiled eggs, presents a delightful, lively, and show-stopping dish that's effortlessly achievable for a Mother's Day brunch extravaganza.

My personal ace up the sleeve in this recipe is the homemade pea puree, which imparts a burst of refreshing spring essence to every bite.

**Ingredients:**

* 2 pc bread
* 2 tbsp pea puree
* 2-4 slices smoked salmon
* 2 pc large eggs
* 1 pc lemon, zested
* 1-2 tbsp fresh peas (optional)
* a few sprigs of fresh dill
* a small bag of mixed greens
* extra virgin olive oil for garnish
* freshly cracked black pepper
* Maldon sea salt (optional)
* softened butter (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions**

1. Fill a small pot of water high enough to submerge two eggs completely. Bring to a boil.
2. Once the water boils, gently lift the eggs into the water using a spoon. Set a timer for 6 minutes \*(see notes!).
3. After the timer goes off, drain the water and run the pan under cold water for 30 seconds to stop the eggs from cooking further.
4. Crack the eggs at the bottom and carefully peel the eggs. Cut in quarters and season with sea salt and black pepper.
5. Pick out the most beautiful herbs and salad leaves from your salad mix.
6. Using your hands, tear them into bite-sized pieces. Soak them in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes and then allow them to dry on a paper towel.
7. Cook the fresh peas briefly in boiling salted water until tender. Drain, rinse quickly in cold water and reserve in a small bowl.
8. Cut the salmon into thinner pieces using scissors.
9. Toast the bread until crispy around the edges and butter both of them.
10. Spread a generous amount of the pea puree on the buttered toast.
11. Add the quartered eggs, then wrap the smoked salmon pieces around the eggs.
12. Garnish with the lettuce, herbs, fresh peas, a few cracks of black pepper, a little zest of lemon rind (using the Microplane), Maldon salt and olive oil.

**Notes**

If you have really sweet fresh peas, you can serve them raw, but quick-cooking them is usually the better option.

If you’re cooking eggs straight from your fridge, then 6 minutes + 30 seconds will be better. For eggs stored at room temperature (like here in Europe) 6 minutes is perfect. These times are for large eggs. If you have smaller eggs then you’ll need to cut back on the cooking time.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12jlf5x/15_minute_smoked_salmon_toast_with_eggs_herbs_and/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12jlf5x/15_minute_smoked_salmon_toast_with_eggs_herbs_and/

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/](https://maplewoodroad.com/brown-sugar-ham-glaze/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 10 pound pre-cooked ham (approximate weight)
* 4 tablespoons salted butter
* 1 cup light brown sugar, packed
* ¼ cup honey
* 1 tablespoon brown mustard
* ½ cup pineapple juice
* ¼ cup apple juice
* ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon ground cloves  


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1.  Preheat oven to 325°F.
2. Unwrap the ham and place it in a large baking dish. I also decided to pour all the juices from the bag in the dish, to help keep it juicy.
3. If you have a spiral-cut ham, there’s nothing else to do. Otherwise, make ¼″ deep cuts in a diamond pattern all over the ham surface (this will allow the juices from the brown sugar ham glaze to drip down inside later).
4. Place in the oven and bake.
5. A ham will take about 1 to 1-½ hours to cook through. After 1 hour, check the temperature by inserting a meat thermometer in the thickest part (being careful not to touch the bone). The ham is ready when the internal temperature has reached 130°F.
6. At about the 1-hour mark, start making the brown sugar ham glaze.
7. Melt butter in a small pan over medium heat. 
8. Once the butter has melted, add all the other ingredients and whisk together.
9. Bring to a simmer, whisking occasionally, and cook for about 5 minutes. 
10. Immediately remove from heat and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes.
11. Check the internal temperature of your ham (the ham is finished cooking when it has reached 130°F).
12. When it’s getting close to that point, but has about a half hour left, baste half of the brown sugar ham glaze onto the ham. 
13. Fifteen minutes later, brush on the remaining ham glaze and let the ham finish cooking until it has reached 130°F.

\* 500ml (0.52 quart) bottled or boiled water at room temperature (no chlorine)

\* 5tbsp rye flour (you can use wholemeal wheat flour as well)

\* 5 garlic cloves, peeled and slightly crushed

\* 4 bay leaves

\* 10 allspice berries

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for the Żurek Soup:**

\* 1,5 litre (1.58 quart) of  vegetable bullion

\* 500ml (0.52 quart) of Żurek starter

\* 4 small pork sausages (you can also add smoked sausage Kielbasa)

\* 250g (8.8oz) uncut smoked bacon (Boczek)

\* 1tsp marjoram

\* 3 tsp of double cream (soured cream works too)

\* Salt to taste

&amp;#x200B;

**To serve:**

\* Boiled diced potatoes

\* Hard-boiled eggs cut in half

\* Sourdough Bread

\* Fresh parsley or dill

\* Black pepper

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Żurek Starter:**

**1.** To prepare the starter, it is important to avoid using water that contains chlorine as it can kill the microbes. To do this, simply boil the water first and then let it cool down to room temperature.

**2.** Once the water is ready, add all of the starter ingredients to a clean jar and stir them together using a spoon.

**3.** Cover the jar with a paper towel or cloth and secure it in place with a tie. This will allow the starter to breathe while also keeping it protected.

**4.** Place the jar in a location that is away from direct sunlight and at room temperature. After approximately 5-7 days, your starter should be ready to use. You can either use it immediately or store it in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. If you choose to store it in the fridge, make sure to remove and discard the spices from the starter. If you use it right away, you can add the starter to your recipe as is.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Bouillon (Soup base):**

**1.** To prepare a vegetable broth, start by combining 1 liter of water with a few diced carrots, 2 medium-sized onions, a piece of celery, and a leek. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cover the pot with a lid. Set a timer for 1 hour.

**2.** After the broth has simmered for an hour, strain the liquid from the vegetables. Save the carrots to use in your soup and discard all the remaining vegetables.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Żurek Soup:**

**1.** Begin by dicing the bacon and pan-frying it over high heat for 4-5 minutes in order to render the fat.

**2.** Next, add the fried bacon, cooked carrots, whole or sliced sausages, and 1 teaspoon of marjoram to the hot stock. Bring the mixture to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer for 5 minutes.

**3.** Whisk the Żurek starter with the sediment (remove spices) and pour it into the soup. Allow the soup to simmer until it thickens.

**4.** Remove the soup from the heat and take out the sausages. Slice the sausages and then return them to the pot.

**5.** In a separate bowl, combine the cream with a ladle of the soup. Mix the ingredients together and then pour the mixture back into the pot. This step will help prevent the cream from curdling.

**6.** Finally, serve the Żurek with hard-boiled eggs and fresh sourdough bread. Smacznego!

**Ingredients:**

* Crust
* 5.5 oz (154g) Oreo cookies
* 1/4 cup (60g) melted butter Chocolate layer
* 5 oz (150g) dark chocolate
* 1/4 cup (60g) + 1 cup (240g) heavy milk (35% fat)

* 10.5 oz (300g) strawberries
* 1/4 cup (50g) sugar
* 1 + 1/4 cup (300g total) heavy milk (35% fat)
* 3 gelatin sheets 

**Recipe:** 

1. For the crust, add the oreos to a food processor and crush for around 1 minute. Add the melted butter and process until it's evenly wet. You can also crush the cookies by placing them in a zip bag and using something like a rolling pin to crush them, and then mix them with the melted butter in a bowl. 
2. Add the mix to an 8-inch (20-cm) pan and even it out with a spoon or the bottom of a cup. It's better if it's a springform pan, but you can also use a pan with a removable bottom. Put it in the fridge until the first layer is ready. 
3. Place 2.5 gelatin sheets into a small bowl of cold water. 
4. Add the dark chocolate and 1/4 cup (60g) of heavy milk into a heat-proof bowl. Place it over a saucepan with simmering water, and at low heat, stir it until the chocolate is melted. 
5. Add the gelatin sheets to the bowl with the chocolate and mix it really well. Then let everything cool down to room temperature or until it doesn't feel warm to the touch (be careful not to leave it too long so the mixture doesn't set). 
6. Whip the cup (240g) of heavy milk (better if it's chilled) in a big bowl until stiff peaks, and then add the melted chocolate and mix until combined. 
7. Add the mixture to the pan with the crust, and even it out. Leave it in the fridge until the next layer. 
8. For the strawberry layer, add the strawberries to a food processor and blend until they are liquid. (Optional: After it's liquid, pass it through a sieve in case you don't want seeds.) 
9. Place three gelatin sheets into a small bowl of cold water. 
10. Add the strawberry liquid and 1/4 cup (50g) of sugar to a medium-heat pan and stir until the sugar is mixed (a few mins).
11. Place the resulting liquid into a bowl, add the gelatin sheets, and mix it really well. Then leave it in the fridge until it's not warm to the touch, around 30–60 minutes. If the gelatin has started to set, whisk well until smooth and loose again. 
12. Whip the 1 + 1/4 cup (300g in total) of heavy milk (better if it's cold) until stiff peaks, and then add the strawberry mixture and mix until combined. 
13. Add the mixture over the first chocolate layer and leave it for at least 3 hours. 
14. To remove the cake from the pan, run a knife along the edges of the pan.
15.  You can add optional cacao powder on top of the cake.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15ml4fi/strawberry_chocolate_mousse_cake_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15ml4fi/strawberry_chocolate_mousse_cake_recipe/

**Ingredients:** 

* 1 cup (100g) Shredded coconut  (+ some more for coating)
* 3/4 cup (180ml) Coconut milk
* 1/3 cup (67g) sugar (+ optional teaspoon of vanilla sugar)
* 1 tablespoon (8g) corn starch 

**Instructions:** 

1.  Mix 1/4 Cup (60ml) Coconut milk with the cornstarch, in a small bowl. Mix until all cornstarch looks wet. Leave it for later.
2. Put the coconut on a pan on medium-high heat for about 30 seconds.
3. Add 1/2 Cup (120ml) of Coconut (or any other type) milk. Slightly mix it (30-60secs). Add the sugar. Also slightly mix it (30-60secs) And then add the cornstarch mixture we did before.
4. Mix everything really well, so the cornstarch doesn't form any clumps,  and cook everything for 3-4mins, while stirring constantly. 
5. After 3-4mins it should look drier, and kind of stick together. If unsure, you can cook a bit longer. Then, remove it from heat.
6. Leave it on a plate for 5-10mins.
7. Once it isn't too hot, and you are able to touch the coconut mass, you can create the balls. Have a bowl with more shredded coconut. Take your coconut mass, and create small balls by rubbing some coconut mass between both of your hands. Then dip it in the coconut bowl, and roll until it's full of coconut on all sides. Then leave it on another plate/bowl. And do the same until no coconut mass is left.
8. Leave it in the fridge. They are much tastier after solidifying for 30-60mins.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15jzos8/easy_4_ingredient_coconut_balls/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15jzos8/easy_4_ingredient_coconut_balls/

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup Granulated Sugar separated into 2/3c and 1/3c
* 2/3 cup Cake Flour
* 1 cup Egg Whites (from ~8 Eggs) or good quality carton egg whites
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Cream of Tartar
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract


**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 325F (300F convection bake). Place 4, small loaf pans onto clean baking pan (note: make sure there is NO oil on surface of pans! I used small (5""x3"") silicone loaf pans. If using other non-stick baking pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper)
2. In a small bowl, mix together 2/3 cup of sugar and 2/3 cup of flour to aerate and sift. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, and with an electric mixer on low speed, beat egg whites with salt and cream of tartar until frothy. Increase speed to medium-high and gradually add 1/3 cup of sugar until mixture resembles stiff peaks (note: this step may take a few extra minutes if using carton egg whites). Fold in vanilla extract.
4. In 3 additions, gently fold flour/sugar mixture into egg white mixture until well incorporated and no flour pockets remain.
5. Equally distribute spoonfuls of angel food cake mixture into each mini loaf pan. Bake for ~45 minutes or until angel food cakes have risen, spring back when lightly touched, and are gently browned on the surface.
6. Once removed from the oven, invert cakes and allow them to cool completely upside-down (either on a wire rack or with sides of pans resting on cups/container). Allow to cool completely at room temperature.
7. Use knife to loosen sides of loaf pan and invert onto flat surface. Optional: Top with sweetened whipped cream and fresh berries.
8. Enjoy!

**Notes**

* If making this dessert in other cake pans, evenly distribute the batter amongst pans and adjust baking time accordingly (when done, cakes should have risen and be lightly brown on the surface)",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15h3mim/mini_angel_food_cake/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15h3mim/mini_angel_food_cake/

&amp;#x200B;

**Preparation time:** 15 minutes

**Baking time:** 40-45 minutes

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for cake:**

\* 11.3oz plain flour, sieved (all purpose flour) 320g

\* 7oz of butter (room temp) 200g

\*8.8oz eggs (4 large, room temp) 250g

\* 6.3oz granulated white sugar, 180g

\* 2 flat tsp of baking powder

\* pinch of salt

\* 1tsp vanilla bean paste

\* 800g of fresh fruit (Strawberry, blueberry, rhubarb, apricots)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for crumble topping:**

\* plain flour 150g

\* granulated white sugar 120g

\* butter 120g

&amp;#x200B;

**Equipment:**

\* 13x9 inch baking tray (33cm x 23cm) If you prefer, you can also use a slightly smaller tray for this recipe. However, keep in mind that in that case, the baking time may be longer.

\* parchment paper

\* mixing bowl

\* standing mixer or hand mixer

\* spatula

\* cooling rack (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Polish Summer Fruit Cake:**

**1.** Preheat the fan-assisted oven to 365°F (180°C). Prepare a baking tray by greasing it lightly with oil and lining it with parchment paper to keep it in place.

**2.** For the cake batter, in a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until pale and fluffy. Reduce the speed to medium and gradually add the eggs one by one, ensuring they are well incorporated. Then, add the vanilla bean paste.

**3.** Stop the mixer and add the sifted flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix on low speed until the ingredients are fully incorporated. If the mixture appears too thick, add two tablespoons of milk or water and incorporate it.

**4.** Using a spatula, transfer the batter to the prepared baking tray and spread it evenly. Arrange the fruit on top; you can halve the strawberries, cut the rhubarb into chunks, and quarter the apricots.

**5.** To prepare the crumble topping, place all the crumble ingredients in a bowl and rub the mixture between your fingers until it is almost combined. Sprinkle the crumble evenly over the fruit.

**6.** Place the baking tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 40-45 minutes.

**7.** Once the cake is ready, allow it to cool for 10 minutes before serving. You can transfer it to a cooling rack, using a sheet of paper and the help of another person to expedite the cooling process.

**8.** Enjoy your delicious cake with a cup of coffee! Smacznego!

Serves: 10 | Cook time: 2 hours (plus 4 hours inactive time)

**Tart filling:**

* 1½ pounds rhubarb, trimmed and chopped (4 cups chopped rhubarb total)
* ½ cup sugar
* ½ cup water
* 4 drops of red food coloring, optional
* 6 egg yolks
* ½ cup sugar
* 6 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter; cut into cubes

**Rhubarb ice cream:**

* 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 16 ounces heavy cream
* ½ cup prepared rhubarb (from above)

**Tart crust:**

* ½ cup (53 g) whole pecans
* 1 cup flour
* ¼ cup (32 g) powdered sugar
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* For serving:
* Powdered sugar, optional

**Prepare the rhubarb:**

1. Combine the chopped rhubarb, ½ cup sugar, and ½ cup water in a medium pot and bring to a boil.
2. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30–45 minutes until very soft.
3. Use an immersion blender to blend until completely smooth. You may also use a traditional blender or food processor. Just pour the mixture back into the pot.
4. Let the rhubarb cool completely. Add the food coloring, if using, and mix well to incorporate.
5. Remove ½ cup of the rhubarb mixture from the pot and reserve for the homemade ice cream.

**Make the ice cream:**

1. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a medium mixing bowl and add the vanilla extract. Stir to combine.
2. Pour the heavy cream into a large mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, mix on medium speed until thick, stiff peaks form.
3. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into the heavy cream and gently fold everything together with a rubber spatula. Do not over-mix!
4. Pour the cream mixture into an 8-inch cake pan or loaf pan. Drizzle the reserved ½ cup of rhubarb on top and use the rubber spatula to swirl and mix into the cream gently.
5. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap. The wrap should be completely in contact with the ice cream without air bubbles. Use your hands to pat it down as tightly as possible. If there are air bubbles, ice crystals will form and make the top of your ice cream icy. Be sure the wrap is in contact with the ice cream from edge to edge. Transfer to the freezer until it is completely frozen, at least 4 hours.

**Prepare the tart crust:**

1. Preheat oven to 350ºF.
2. Place the pecans in a food processor and pulse them into a fine meal. Transfer to a mixing bowl with the flour and powdered sugar. Add ¼ teaspoon salt.
3. Melt the butter in the microwave or a small saucepan over the stovetop. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Let stand for 5 minutes. Pour the butter into the bowl of flour and pecans and use a rubber spatula to mix until there are no dry bits of flour and the dough is smooth and moist.
4. Place the dough into a 10” greased pie dish or tart pan. Use your hands to smooth it into the dish and up the sides in an even layer. Transfer to the oven for 15 minutes. Remove and let stand for 30 minutes. Keep the oven at 350ºF.

**Finish the filling:**

1. Add the egg yolks and remaining ½ cup sugar to the pot of the remaining rhubarb. Turn the heat back to medium and whisk until completely smooth.
2. Add the cold, cubed butter and continue whisking until the heat melts the butter completely. It will take 2–3 minutes of regular whisking. Continue whisking until completely smooth. Turn off the heat and immediately pour into the prepared crust.

**Bake the tart:**

1. Transfer the tart to the oven for 15 minutes; carefully rotate the tart once midway through cooking.
2. After 15 minutes, remove from the oven and do a jiggle check. It should be set up around the edges and slightly jiggly in the middle. It should wobble, not slosh. If it’s still very jiggly around the edges, return to the oven and continue baking in 2-minute increments until the tart is set around the edges but still jiggly in the middle. It should not need more than 20 minutes in the oven.

**Finish the tart:**

1. Let the tart stand for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, transfer to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight before serving.

**To serve:**

1. Slice the tart and carefully remove each piece. If you made this in a pie dish, it will be more difficult to serve but not impossible!

13idkkl,How to Create a Decadent Delight: Heavenly Pudding in a Glass Recipe,39,3,1684169805.0,0.96,Dessert,Destiny_town,https://i.redd.it/obqssl1rz00b1.jpg,"Hello, friends!

My recipe for a simple dessert in a glass. [Original recipe and a couple of tips](https://grillmangal.art/en/dessert-in-a-glass/)

**Ingredients**

* Milk – 150 ml
* Cornstarch – 1 tablespoon (8-10 g)
* Sugar – 1 tablespoon (15 g)
* Egg (60-65 g) – 1 piece
* Vanilla sugar (or extract) – 1 teaspoon (5 g)
* Cocoa powder – 2 teaspoons (for decoration)
* Orange – 1 slice (for serving)

**Cooking process:**

1. In a small saucepan, whisk the egg (using a fork or mixer, it’s better to use a mixer for this recipe).
2. Add the sugar and gradually add all the cornstarch.
3. Beat well until the sugar is completely dissolved.
4. Gradually and carefully, while stirring, add the milk. Do it gradually to avoid lumps
5. Place the saucepan over medium heat and, stirring constantly, bring the mixture to a boil
6. Reduce the heat and cook, stirring, for another 2-3 minutes until the mixture thickens to the desired consistency.
7. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the vanilla, and mix well.
8. Allow the mixture to cool for about 15 minutes.
9. Transfer the mixture to glasses. According to this recipe, you’ll get exactly 2 glasses
10. Usually, cocoa powder is used for decoration just before serving, but I like a dark brown crust, so I add cocoa powder while the dessert is still warm. Here’s how to add cocoa powder: Cover the glass halfway with paper or a knife, sprinkle cocoa powder into a sieve, and sift it onto our glass, you can create any pattern you like.
11. Place the dessert in the refrigerator for 30-40 minutes.
12. Remove the dessert, decorate with a slice of orange.
13. Enjoy!

That’s the whole recipe!

13283tx,Berry Shortcake Recipe,338,7,1682711980.0,0.97,Dessert,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/yyiqjww1lowa1.jpg,"This recipe comes from my mother-in-law’s grandmother, Grandma Warner and it’s one I make a few times a year now during strawberry season. Grandma Warner formed them into 3 large biscuits, but I do 4 smaller biscuits to keep it even. No need to change any of the quantities; just make them a bit smaller.

You can make them precisely as listed above and they’ll be delicious and easy. I use butter instead of shortening. Right before baking, I also brush the tops with melted butter and sprinkle on a bit of turbinado sugar.

Ingredients:

* 1 pint strawberries or mixed berries
* 1–2 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1 cup sifted flower
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 2 tablespoons shortening or cold butter
* Whole milk, about 5–6 tablespoons or so
* 1 tablespoon melted butter
* Pinch of turbinado sugar, optional
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 tablespoon vanilla pudding powder, optional

**Before starting:**

1. Preheat oven to 425ºF. Set aside a baking sheet for the biscuits.

**Prepare the berries:**

1. Rinse the berries and transfer them to a saucepan. Sprinkle 1–2 tablespoons sugar on top. Turn the heat to medium. As soon as the berries begin to bubble, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15–20 minutes. Lightly mash a few of the berries to thicken the syrup further. Turn off the heat and set aside.

**Prepare the biscuits:**

1. Combine the sifted flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Cut in the shortening or butter using a fork or your fingers until the mixture becomes crumbly, the size of peas.
2. Work in the milk, a few tablespoons at a time, until it becomes a soft, sticky dough.
3. Form the dough into 4 rough biscuits. They don’t need to be rolled into perfect circles; the rough edges will crisp up and be better than perfect dough balls!
4. Transfer the biscuits to the baking sheet. Brush each biscuit with melted butter and sprinkle a pinch of turbinado sugar on top of each biscuit.
5. Transfer to the oven for 11–12 minutes. The bottoms will be golden brown and the the top will be a very light golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.

**Prepare the whipped cream:**

1. While the biscuits bake, place the cream in a large bowl with the vanilla extract. If you’d like a more stabilized whipped cream, add the vanilla pudding powder. Using a hand mixer, mix on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.

Decoration (optional)

* 1 cup Heavy Cream
* 2 tbsp Granulated Sugar
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1 cup Raspberries (fresh or frozen)
* Shaved white chocolate curls

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 325F (300F convection oven). Gather a 9"" springform pan, set aside.

Chocolate Cookie Crust

1. In a medium bowl, combine chocolate cookie crumbs with sugar and melted butter. Pour cookie crumb mixture into your 9"" springform pan. Press crumbs into the base of your pan. Set aside.

Cheesecake

1. In a large bowl, using a hand mixer, beat together softened cream cheese with granulated sugar. Mix until just combined.
2. Add eggs, one at a time, until mixture is smooth and creamy. Add vanilla and salt.
3. In a small bowl, add hot heavy cream to white chocolate. Let stand for 2-3min then stir until chocolate is melted. Add chocolate mixture to egg/cheesecake mixture. You want a mixture that is smooth and creamy.
4. Meanwhile, add sugar to thawed berries. Mix until combined. Let stand for 1-2 min to allow the sugar to dissolve into the berries.

Assembly &amp; Baking

1. Pour half of the cheesecake mixture into the springform pan with cookie crust. Add spoonfuls of raspberry to the surface of the cheesecake mixture, swirl with a knife. Add remaining 1/2 of cheesecake mixture, and repeat raspberry dolloping process. Use a toothpick/knife to swirl through the mixture, creating a spiral design.
2. Place springform pan onto baking sheet, to collect any leaks of oil during baking. Bake in a oven preheated to 325F for 1h 30-40 minutes or until mixture gently set at the edges and is slightly wobbly in the centre. Turn off oven and allow cheesecake to cool in the oven. (Note: I recommend partially propping open the door of your oven to allow heat to slowly escape while cheesecake cools).
3. Once cheesecake is cool to room temperature, place in the refrigerator to set for ~4h to overnight.

Decorations

1. Remove the rim of your springform pan. Place cheesecake on flat surface.
2. In a small bowl mix 1 cup of thawed frozen raspberries with 2 tsp of sugar. Stir until combined. Let sit for 1-2 minutes until sugar is dissolved.
3. In a medium bowl, combine heavy cream with sugar, and vanilla extract. Whip to a light, airy, whipped cream texture. Set aside.
4. Dollop additional raspberry sauce on surface of the cheesecake (note: I like adding additional raspberry mixture to the raspberry dollops/cracks in the cheesecake) and decorate cheesecake with pipped Chantilly cream. Top with additional raspberries, and shaved white chocolate, as desired!
5. Cut, serve, and enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12zfykl/white_chocolate_raspberry_cheesecake/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12zfykl/white_chocolate_raspberry_cheesecake/

Yield: 9 rolls

See how I made it [here](https://youtu.be/9MdEwiQar5k).  
*Ingredients*  
**For dough:**

* 250ml milk
* 113g unsalted butter, room temperature
* 70g granulated sugar
* 2 eggs, room temperature
* 7g active dry yeast
* 600g all purpose flour
* 10g salt

**For filling:**

* 220g brown sugar
* 113g unsalted butter, softened
* 2 tbsp cinnamon
* Pinch of nutmeg

**For Icing:**

* 120g cream cheese, softened
* 113g unsalted butter, softened
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 250g powdered sugar

*Method*  


1. Scald the milk (bring it to a boil and immediately remove from heat). Allow it to cool to a warm (not hot) temperature (\~110-115ºF).
2. Add the yeast to the milk and mix well. Set aside and rest for 5-7 minutes.
3. In a stand mixer bowl, add flour, butter, granulated sugar, eggs, salt, and activated yeast mixture. With a dough hook, stir, then then knead on low for about 15-20 minutes, just before it reaches window pane texture.
4. Turn out the dough onto a prep surface and knead until it has a window pane texture (when thinned out, light comes through it without the dough breaking).
5. Form dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for 60-90 minutes until doubled in size.

While dough is rising, prepare the filling:

1. mix brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl until fully mixed. 
2. Add the butter, and mix until incorporated. Set aside.

Once the dough has finished rising:

1. Turn out the dough onto prep surface. Flatten to remove the air bubbles.
2. Roll the dough out into approx. 1”/2cm thick in a rectangular shape, then fold and press it into thirds. 
3. Flip the dough and roll out to a 12x18”/30x45cm rectangle, about 1/2”1cm thick.
4. Spread filling evenly onto rolled dough, leaving a 1/2”/1cm edge.
5. With a wheel pastry cutter or pizza cutter, cut the dough into thirds (widthwise, perpendicular to the longer side), then cut each third into thirds again to make 9 rolls.
6. Roll each strip and tuck the end into the roll. Place the rolls, tucked side down, into a 9x13”/22x33cm baking dish lined with parchment paper.
7. Tent the rolls with plastic wrap, and let them rise again for 15-30 minutes.
8. While rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 350ºF/180ºC.

While the oven preheats, prepare the icing:

1. Beat cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar until smooth. Set aside.

Once the oven is preheated:

1. Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes, until lightly golden on the top.
2. Immediately after removing the rolls from the oven, spread a layer of icing onto them.

Serve warm, add additional icing if desired.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1295mpg/cinnamon_rolls_with_cream_cheese_icing/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1295mpg/cinnamon_rolls_with_cream_cheese_icing/

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**This recipe makes: 6 portions**

**Ingredients for Polish Apple Pancakes:**

\* 2 medium-sized apples, peeled and diced into small pieces

\* 1egg

\* 3tbsp of sugar

\* 1tsp of baking powder

\* 1.5 cups of plain flour (185g)

\* 0.5 cup of milk (125ml)

\* 1/2 lemon juice (skip if your apples are already very sour)

\* 1tsp of vanilla extract

\* oil for frying

\* icing sugar for dusting

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Polish Apple Pancakes:**

**1.** In a bowl, mix the diced apples with the juice of half a lemon. Set aside until later. Skip the lemon juice if the apples are already sour enough.

**2.** In a separate mixing bowl, whisk 1 egg and 3 tbsp of sugar until pale yellow, which should take around 2 minutes.

**3.** Add 1 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, and milk. Whisk the mixture until it's smooth and free of lumps. If the batter seems too thick, add 20ml more milk. Keep in mind that higher protein flour absorbs more liquid.

**4.** Fold in the diced apples and mix them into the batter. (Alternatively you can grate them instead for different texture)

**5.** Heat a frying pan over medium heat with 1 tbsp of oil. Add 2 tbsp of pancake mix to the pan, and spread it slightly into the desired shape. Fry the pancake on each side for around 2 minutes. If the pancake browns too quickly, turn down the heat.

**6.** Once the pancake is cooked, dust it with icing sugar, and enjoy your delicious Polish apple pancake (Racuchy z Jabłkami)!

2. Separate the eggs.
3. Beat the egg yolks with 55g of sugar on high until light and fluffy (about 4 minutes). Should have a ribbon consistency. Set aside.
4. Beat the egg whites on high. Once they have turned white, add the 35g of sugar slowly and steadily. Beat to soft peaks and set aside.
5. Sift cornstarch and flour into a bowl. 
6. Fold about 1/3 of the egg whites into the egg yolk. Once nearly incorporated, sift 1/3 of the cornstarch and flour and fold gently into the mix, careful not to deflate the batter.
7. Repeat #6 and gently fold just until all ingredients are incorporated.
8. Put the batter in a piping bag fitted with a 1A tip.
9. Pipe into 8cm/3” circles onto a baking sheet lined with parchment (aim for rounds that are slightly smaller in circumference than the serving glasses). For ladyfingers, pipe into 10cm/4"" tubes.
10. generously dust with powdered sugar and bake for 4-6 minutes until lightly golden. watch them carefully as they can easily burn.
11. Allow to cool completely on the baking sheet. 

Cream:

1. While the biscuits are cooling, beat the whipping cream and powdered sugar in a bowl until just lightly whipped.
2. In a separate bowl, spread the mascarpone and stir in the lightly whipped cream in 2-3 batches.
3. Put the cream into a piping bag fitted with a 1A tip.

Assembly:

1. Pipe one layer of cream in the bottom of the serving cup or bowl. 
2. Completely dunk a biscuit in the coffee, turning it over to make sure it is saturated, and layer it on top of the cream layer. Repeat and top with a final cream layer.
3. The layers should be: cream, biscuit, cream, biscuit, and one final cream layer. Dust the top with cocoa powder and serve.

Note:  
To enhance the coffee flavor, pour a bit of the coffee on top of each saturated biscuit layer before piping cream over it.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10z9mv5/tiramisu_with_baked_savoiardi_ladyfingers_and_no/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10z9mv5/tiramisu_with_baked_savoiardi_ladyfingers_and_no/

**INGREDIENTS**

Dough

* ¾ cup milk (warmed)
* 1 large egg, at room temperature
* 1 tsp ube extract
* 6 tbsp unsalted butter (softened) 85g
* 3 ¼ cup all-purpose flour (scooped and levelled) 406.25g
* 1/3 cup granulated sugar
* ¼ tsp salt
* 1 package of instant dry yeast (8g or 2 ¼ tsp)

Ube Cinnamon Filling

* 1/3 cup ube halaya jam
* ¼ cup brown sugar
* 1 tbsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter (softened)
* 1/3 cup heavy cream (Pour over the risen rolls)

Cream Cheese Frosting

* ½ cup cream cheese
* 2 tbsp unsalted butter (Softened)
* ½ tsp vanilla extract
* 1/8 tsp salt
* 2/3 cup of confection sugar

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. **Prepare the dough.** Warm the milk and add to your stand mixer bowl and add the yeast. Stir and let it sit for a few minutes. Add eggs, butter and sugar and mix with the flat beater paddle attachment until well combined. Add in salt and 3 ¼ cup (406 grams) of all-purpose flour and mix using the beater paddle for 1 minute. Scrape the dough off the attachment and switch to the dough hook. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes.  \*The dough should be slightly sticking to the side of the mixing bowl\*
2. **Proof the dough.** Lightly spray oil in a large bowl. Use a spatula to transfer the dough from the mixing bowl to the greased bowl. Place the dough in a warm corner or I use the proofing setting on my oven and let it proof for 30 minutes. \*The dough is ready when it has doubled in size. The time will vary depending on how warm the corner is. Avoid letting it rise too much otherwise, the rolls will be airy\*
3. **Prepare Ube Cinnamon Filling.** In a small mixing bowl, combine the soft butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and ube halaya jam mixing until well combined. Set aside.
4. **Roll the dough out.** Sprinkle a clean surface with flour. Turn out the dough onto the surface. Punch the air out of the dough. Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough to about a 15×12"" rectangle. You may need to stretch it so the corners are even.
5. **Spread ube cinnamon filling.** Use a spatula and evenly spread out the ube cinnamon filling over the whole dough rectangle.
6. **Roll the dough.** On the long end of the dough use both hands and start rolling the edge up and tightly tuck it in and roll it all the way until you get a nice long log.
7. **Mark and cut into rolls.** Mark the top of the log into equal third portions. Within those 1/3 portions mark equal third portions. There should be 9 equal markings. Use a sharp serrated knife or dental floss to cut the rolls.
8. **Place in pan and let it rise.** Grease the 9-inch pan and place the rolls 3 x 3. Let it rise for 30 minutes. I proof in my oven at 100 degrees. Let the rolls expand so its fills the empty space between the rolls.
9. **Pour heavy cream over rolls.** Once the rolls have proof more pour the heavy cream all over the top and let it absorb. 
10. **Bake.** Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake the rolls for 21-23 minutes. The top of the buns should be lightly browned. 
11. **Prepare cream cheese frosting.** While the ube cinnamon rolls are baking prepare the cream cheese frosting. Using the KitchenAid stand mixer or hand mixer whip the soft butter, cream cheese until its well blended. Add the vanilla extract, salt and confection sugar and blend until creamy texture.
12. **Spread the frosting.** Spread the cream cheese frosting over the cooled ube cinnamon rolls.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10ryswh/ube_cinnamon_rolls_with_cream_cheese_frosting/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10ryswh/ube_cinnamon_rolls_with_cream_cheese_frosting/

Prepare a restaurant-like dessert at your home with my easy-to-follow recipe for ''burned cream''. It is perfect for any occasion and very quick in preparation.

Originally posted [here](https://www.insightflavour.com/post/cr%C3%A8me-br%C3%BBl%C3%A9e)

&amp;#x200B;

Preparation time: 10min

Baking time: 35-40 minutes.

Cooling time: 1h 10min

Recipe makes: 6 portions

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

\* 420 ml (14.8oz) of double cream

\* 100ml (3.5oz) of milk (full fat works best)

\* 1 tsp of vanilla bean paste

\* 5 medium egg yolks

\* 70g (2.45oz) of caster sugar (plus extra for topping)

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

**1.** Heat the oven to a 160C fan (320F).

**2.** Place 6, 100ml ramekins into a baking dish, one deep enough that you can cover with tin foil without touching the top of the ramekins.

**3.** Pour double cream and milk into a small pan, and whisk in 1 tsp of vanilla bean paste.

**4.** Put the egg yolks and sugar in a mixing bowl and whisk until combined.

**5.** Put the pan with the cream on medium heat and bring it to 80C/176F. As soon as you see bubbles appear, take the pan off the heat (do not boil). Pour the cream mixture into a jug to stop it from heating up more.

**6.** Slowly and in stages pour the hot cream into the beaten egg yolk mixture, stirring with a spoon as you do so. (Do not rush or add too quickly as this will result in scrambled eggs)

**7.** Using a big spoon, scoop off all the foam that is sitting on top of the liquid and discard. Pour the mixture back into a jug.

**8.** Pour enough hot tap water into the baking dish to come about 3/4 up the sides of the ramekins. Pour the hot cream into the ramekins.

**9.** Place tin foil on the top of a baking dish leaving a small gap on both sides of the container. This will allow air to circulate.

**10.** Place the covered dish in the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes until the mixture is softly set. To check, gently sway the roasting tin and if the crème brûlées are ready, they will wobble a bit like jelly in the middle. Don’t let them get too firm or too runny.

**11.** Once ready, lift the ramekins out of the baking dish with oven gloves and set them on a wire rack to cool for a couple of minutes, then put them in the fridge to cool completely (1 hour). This can be done overnight as well.

**12.** Before serving, sprinkle 1,5 tsp of caster sugar over each ramekin and spread it out with the back of a spoon to completely cover.

**13.** Use a blow torch to caramelise the sugar. Hold the flame just above the sugar and keep moving it round and round until caramelised.

**Insight:**

\* If no blow torch is available, set your oven on the grill. Place ramekins on a baking tray and caramelise watching carefully not to burn the sugar too much.

\* Egg yolk sets at a temperature between 62-65C (144F-149F)

\* You can keep your Crème Brûlée in the fridge for up to 5 days, and cover it with cling film to avoid smell exchange.

\* For the premium Crème Brûlée, I recommend using organic eggs as their flavour is much better than standard eggs.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10iht36/crème_brûlée/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10iht36/crème_brûlée/

**INGREDIENTS**

Tangyuan dough

* 1 cup glutinous rice flour (sweet rice flour)
* 1/2 cup warm water
* 1/2 tsp ube extract (for the purple color, used for half the dough)

Black sesame filling

* 1/3 cup black sesame seeds
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter (softened)

Sweet ginger pandan syrup

* 4 cup water
* 1 slice of ginger
* 2 pandan leaves
* 1/2 cup sugar

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Prepare the filling

1. **Grind and Mix Filling.** Add the black sesame seeds to your food processor and blend until the black sesame seeds are almost a coarse powder. Roughly 3-5 minutes depending on your food processor. Add the sugar and blend for 2 minutes on high. Once it is well blended add the softened unsalted butter and blend until well incorporated. Refrigerate the black sesame filling for 25-30 minutes. 
2. **Refrigerate filling.** When the filling is hard take it out and divide it into 20 equal portions. The black sesame filling weighed 220 grams (I divided them into 11-12 grams each). Roll them into balls and put them back in the fridge. 

Prepare the dough

1. **Combined flour and water.** Add the glutinous rice flour to a medium size bowl. Pour half the warm water and stir until all the water is absorbed. Add the second half and stir until all the water is absorbed into the flour.
2. **Knead dough.** Using your hands knead the dough until it’s well incorporated. The dough should be soft and smooth. Add more water if the dough is cracking and if the dough is too wet and sticky add more flour. 
3. **Divide in half and mix ube extract.** The total weight of my dough was 210 grams so I weighed half (Approximately 105 grams) and added the ube extract and knead the dough until the purple color was well mixed into the dough.
4. **Portion out 20 rice balls.** Take the white dough and divide it into 10 equal portions and roll them into balls. If using a scale weigh 10-11 grams for each rice ball. Repeat for the purple dough. You should have a total of 20 rice balls.

Assemble the tangyuan

1. **Take out filling in batches.** Work in batches with the black sesame fillings. Take out of the fridge 5 at a time while you assemble. This is to prevent the filling from melting.
2. **Assemble.** Flatten the rice ball in your hands by pressing your palms down. Using your thumb and make a slight dent in the centre so the sesame filling will sit snug use both sets of hands or use your fingers to gently wrap the edge up and around the top until it’s completely sealed. Alternatively, make a circle with your thumb and index finger and place the tang yuan in the middle and gently wrap it up. Both methods will work. Repeat until all of them have been assembled.

Make the sweet ginger pandan broth

1. **Boil ginger and pandan leaves.** Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the sliced ginger and pandan leaves and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the sugar and let it simmer until the sugar has dissolved.

Cook

1. **Cook tang yuan in sweet soup.** Add the tang yuan to the water and gently stir so it does not stick to the bottom of the pot. Once the tang yuan floats to the top it is ready. This will take about 4-5 minutes.
2. **Serve.** Serve with sweet ginger pandan soup.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10g4tql/black_sesame_glutinous_rice_balls_tangyuan_for/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10g4tql/black_sesame_glutinous_rice_balls_tangyuan_for/

* 1/4 teaspoon salt

FOR THE BATTER: 

* 6 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 cup milk
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon

1. Cut an 'X' in the bottom of your peaches and place them in some boiling water for about 4 minutes.  This will help you remove the skins if you don't want to peel them another way.
2. Once the skins are removed you can slice them around the pit and separate the halves, and then cut the halves into slices.
3. Add the sliced peaches, sugar and salt to a saucepan and stir to combine.   You'll cook the peach mixture for about 5 minutes or until the peaches start to break down and the sugar is all dissolved.
4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
5. Cut your butter into tablespoon pieces and add them to the bottom of a 9 x 13 in baking dish.  And then add your dish to the preheating oven until the butter is melted and is slightly browned.
6. In a bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.
7. Mix in the milk, until the batter is smooth, but don't over mix. Pour the batter into the pan with the melted butter.  And if needed spread out the batter so it is as even as you can make it in the pan.
8. Add the peaches and juice from the pan over the batter making sure to add them as lightly as possible so they don't sink too far down into the batter.  And make sure you do not mix the peaches in.  You want the peaches to be sitting on top. 9.Dust your cinnamon on top of your peaches.
9. Bake at 350 degrees for about 38-40 minutes.  The top will be starting to brown and the bottom will be bubbling.  Let cool for about 10 minutes so it has a chance to setup a little.
10. Then scoop out a portion and I like to top it with some vanilla ice cream.  Dust with more cinnamon if you'd like, and enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10fakmx/classic_peach_cobbler_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10fakmx/classic_peach_cobbler_recipe/

**Ingredients**

Dough

- 4 1/2 – 3/4 cups Bread Flour separated (1st: 2 cups, then 2 cups, then 1/2 - - cup, then optional 1/4 cup)
- 1/3 cup Granulated Sugar
- 2 packets Instant Yeast
- 1 1/3 cup Milk
- 1/3 cup Salted Butter cut into cubes
- 1 Egg large, room temperature

Cinnamon Filling

- 1/4 cup Salted Butter
- 3/4 cup Brown Sugar (light or dark)
- 2 tbsp Cinnamon

Cream Cheese Frosting

- 1 package Cream Cheese
- 1/2 cup Salted Butter
- 2 cups Powdered Sugar
- 1 tsp Vanilla Bean Paste or vanilla extract

**Instructions**

Dough

1. In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of flour with sugar and yeast. Whisk to sift and aerate the mixture. Set aside.
2. In a heat proof bowl/cup, heat butter together with milk in a microwave for 45 seconds (Note: not all the butter will be melted! The milk should be warm to the touch but not hot. If the mixture is hot, let it cool slightly before adding to the yeast/flour mixture).
3. Add the milk/butter mixture and egg to the flour/yeast mixture. Mix together with a wooden spoon until a thick, wet mixture is formed. Add an additional 2 cups of flour and mix to fully incorporate. Finally, add an additional 1/2 cup of flour until a soft dough is formed.
4. Knead together dough until it becomes homogenous, smooth, and soft. (Note: if the dough continues to stick to your fingers, add an additional 1/4 cup of flour and incorporate it into the dough). The final mixture should bounce back after a finger is indented into it. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes, uncovered.
5. Roll dough into a 15"" by 12"" rectangle.

Cinnamon Filling &amp; Assembly

1. Spread softened butter over surface of the dough rectangle, leaving a 1/2"" border that is butter free.
Combine brown sugar with cinnamon. Sprinkle cinnamon mixture over butter layer.
2. Roll dough from the 15"" end into a thick log. Once rolling is complete, gently push together both ends of the log to make them even. Divide dough into 12 pieces by scoring the surface of the log. Using an unflavoured piece of floss, slide floss underneath log and pull up to cut log (Note: this step prevents squishing the cinnamon rolls during the cutting process).
3. Place cinnamon rolls into a buttered 9""x13"" pan. Cover with a towel and place in a warm location to proof for 1 hour.
4. Preheat oven to 350F (325F convection oven). Bake for 30-35 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Let cool for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the cream cheese frosting.

Cream Cheese Frosting

1. In a medium sized bowl, combine softened butter with cream cheese. Start by mashing with a fork/spoon until creamy. Add powdered sugar and vanilla paste/extract then mix together until mixture resembles a clumpy paste. Finally, use a whisk to beat together icing.
2. Spread a generous layer of cream cheese icing onto the tops of the warm cinnamon rolls. Serve and enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10f892o/cinnamon_rolls/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10f892o/cinnamon_rolls/

Yield: 10""/25cm bundt pan, about 10 cups. 

See how I made it [here](https://youtu.be/ixFJKKVAa2k).

**Ingredients:**  
*Sponge*

* 150g all purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* Pinch of salt
* 200g granulated sugar
* 4 eggs
* 125ml vegetable oil
* 100ml milk
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

*Flan*

* 4 eggs, room temperature
* 130g granulated sugar
* 500ml milk, room temperature
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

*Topping*

* 300g cajeta, warmed for easy pouring (can be substituted with dulce de leche or caramel) 
* Fresh strawberries for garnish

Method:

1. Preheat the oven to 180ºC/355ºF.
2. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl and whisk together. Set aside.
3. Beat the eggs, vegetable oil, milk, and vanilla until fully incorporated. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients and mix just until incorporated (no lumps).
4. Lightly butter the inside of the bundt pan. 
5. Pour 150g of cajeta into the pan and distribute along the bottom.
6. Pour the cake batter into the pan and set aside while you make the flan mix.
7. In a separate bowl or in a blender jar, combine the eggs, sugar, milk, and vanilla. Blend with an immersion blender (or stand blender) just until mixed, no more than 10 seconds.
8. Rap the bowl/jar on the counter a few times to bring any air bubbles to the top.
9. Pour the flan mix through a strainer gently into the pan, right over the cake batter. (This is the “impossible” part, the leavening agents in the cake batter will cause it to rise, while the flan will sink to the bottom of the pan)
10. Place the pan in a deep baking pan and pour hot water into the baking pan, about 1.5” high.
11. Bake at 180ºC/355ºF for 1 hour.
12. Once done baking, remove the pan from the Bain Marie and allow to cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap and chill overnight.
13. The next day, invert the pan onto a serving dish and gently tap/rap until the cake drops from the pan. 
14. Drizzle with warmed cajeta (this makes it easier to pour), and top with strawberry slices if desired. Drizzle a bit more cajeta on the top.

**Ingredients**

Crust:

* 300g (10.5oz) digestive biscuits
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt
* 120g (½ cup / 1 stick) unsalted butter, melted

Cheesecake:

* 680g (3x 8oz package) cream cheese, room temperature
* 4 large eggs
* 200g (1 cup) granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 10g (2 tablespoons) hojicha powder
* 2 tablespoon water, room temperature  


Sour cream topping:

* 450ml (16 oz) sour cream, room temperature
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons matcha powder  


**Directions**  
Crust:

1. Heat the oven to 175°C (350°F). Grease a 23cm (9-inch) springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.
2. In a food processor, blitz 300g (10.5oz) biscuits until finely ground. Add 1 tablespoon brown sugar and ¼ teaspoon salt, and process until combined. Slowly pour in 120g (½ cup / 1 stick) melted butter and process again until combined – the mixture will look like wet sand. (If you don’t have a food processor, place biscuits, sugar and salt in a ziplock bag and crush with a heavy plate or rolling pin, before pouring butter into bag and massaging the bag until the butter coats the crumbs.)
3. Press the mixture into the bottom and of the prepared pan with a flat-bottomed measuring cup or mug. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature.

Filling &amp; assembly:

1. Cut 3 pieces of heavy-duty kitchen foil and put them in criss cross on the work surface. Set springform pan in the middle and wrap the edges of the foil around the sides of the pan. This will prevent the water from the water bath seeping in. Keep the oven at 175°C (350°F).
2. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, in a large bowl, beat 680g (24oz) cream cheese until fluffy. Add 4 eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add 200g (1 cup) of sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and mix well, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
3. In a small cup, mix 2 tablespoons of hojicha powder with 2 tablespoon of water until a thick paste forms. Scoop 4 tablespoons of cheesecake mix into the cup and mix with the hojicha paste until combined. Pour the hojicha mix into the large bowl and stir into cheesecake mix until combined. The mixture will be a light shade of brown.
4. Pour the filling into the prepared crumb crust. Place the pan (with aluminium foil on the outside) on a high-walled baking sheet and into the oven. Pour hot water into the baking sheet so the water comes up to the halfway mark of the springform pan. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, until the cake is just set in the center. Gently remove the cake from the oven but do not turn the oven off.
5. In a medium bowl, whisk 450ml (16 oz) sour cream and 1 tablespoon of sugar. To a smaller bowl, scoop out 2 tablespoons of sour cream and sift 2 teaspoons of matcha powder; mix until combined. Add this matcha-sour cream mix to the medium bowl and stir to combine. Spoon the sour cream mixture onto the cheesecake and spread with the back of the spoon. Return pan to the oven and continue to bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the sour cream layer is set and warmed through.
6. Switch off the oven and open the oven door an inch or so. Leave the cake in the oven until it cools to room temperature (around 1h) to prevent cracks. Remove cheesecake from the oven and store it in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or ideally overnight.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1044qlp/hojicha_cheesecake_with_matcha_sour_cream_topping/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1044qlp/hojicha_cheesecake_with_matcha_sour_cream_topping/

zqdjae,Matcha Puff Pastry Christmas Tree Dessert,40,4,1671508355.0,0.91,Dessert,CookwithChung,https://i.redd.it/t31xfuiw6z6a1.jpg,"[Matcha Puff Pastry Christmas Tree](https://cookwithchung.com/matcha-puff-pastry-christmas-tree/)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 2 sheets puff pastry (I use 10-inch X 10-inch sheets)
* 2 tsp matcha powder (Ceremonial or Culinary Grade)
* 3 tsp condensed milk
* 1 tbsp hot milk
* 1 egg yolk (for egg wash)
* icing sugar (Optional)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

**Defrost puff pastry and mix the matcha mixture**

1. Take out of the freezer 2 hours before you plan to start making the Christmas tree puff. Let it defrost on the counter.
2. . Prepare the matcha mixture by combining hot milk with sifted matcha powder. Stir until it’s mixed well. Add the condensed milk to the matcha and stir until well combined. Set aside until the puff pastry is ready to use.

**Prepare puff pastry and cut it into a tree shape**

1. Prepare the puff pastry. Take the puff pastry and unroll. Use a rolling pin to roll out creases. The puff pastry sheets I get in stores come in squares (10-inch X 10-inch). It will very dependent on where you’re located. I have seen puff pastry sheets come in a rectangular shape.
2. Cut puff pastry into a tree shape. There are two methods for cutting out the tree shape. I would suggest placing both sheets on top and cutting them. You can also cut them separately.

**Method 1 - Wing it**

1. Cut the slits for the tree trunk at the bottom. In the middle cut ½ inch slits on left and right. The trunk will be 1 inch in height.
2. To create the tree top place three marks. The first mark on the top of the puff pastry. The second and third will be on the left and right sides of the puff pastry 1 inch from the bottom.
3. Cut the diagonal lines from the top to the left and right. Cut the bottoms horizontally ensuring to keep the tree truck intact.

**Method 2 - Create and use a template**

1. Use parchment paper and cut out the exact same size as the puff pastry.
2. On the parchment paper cut the slits for the tree trunk at the bottom. In the middle cut ½ inch slits on the left and right. The trunk will be 1 inch in height.
3. To create the tree top place three marks. The first mark on the top of the puff pastry. The second and third will be on the left and right sides of the puff pastry 1 inch from the bottom.
4. Cut the diagonal lines from the top to the left and right. Cut the bottoms horizontally ensuring to keep the truck intact.
5. Place the parchment paper on top of the puff pastry and cut the puff pastry ensuring to cut along the outside of the parchment paper.

**Spread matcha mixture, cut and twist branches**

1. Spread the matcha spread. Place one sheet of the Christmas tree on your baking sheet with parchment paper and spread the matcha mixture. Place the second cut sheet of puff pastry on top.
2. Cut and twist the branches. On both sides cut horizontally from both sides but leave one inch in the centre uncut to keep the Christmas tree intact. DO NOT CUT all the way through. I cut the horizontal lines approximately 1 inch apart. Then start twisting. Press the edges of the twisted branches down at the ends.

**Egg wash, bake, and top with matcha mixture/icing sugar**

1. Using a brush to cover the top of the puff pastry with egg wash to give it a nice golden color.
2. Preheat oven to 375 ° F. Bake for 15 minutes or until the entire Christmas tree puff is puffed up.
3. Cool and top if icing sugar. Take the puff pastry out of the oven and let it cool on the baking tray for 5 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and with the extra matcha mixture, I brush it lightly over the puff pastry and dust with some icing sugar.

**Notes:**

\- With the extra puff pastry I used it to make Matcha Puff Pastry Twist. Cut the puff pastry into 1-inch wide strips and brush the matcha mixture and twist.

\- If the puff pastry is larger in size double up on the matcha mixture so there is enough to brush between the puff pastry and on top of the tree after it's done baking.

1. In a large measuring cup add the warm water, yeast, egg, salt and sugar. Mix to combine. Stir in the flour, then knead on a floured surface until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a bowl and cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
2. Roll out the dough on a floured surface into an 18 inch square. Arrange a square of the butter slices in the centre at a 45 degree angle to the corners of the dough so it forms a diamond inside the square. Fold the dough corners over the butter to encase it fully and seal.
3. Roll out the dough into a rectangle.
4. Take a shorter side and fold 1/3 of the rectangle over towards the centre. Do the same with the opposite side. You will now have a pile of 3 layers, as you would with a business letter. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.
5. Repeat this rolling and folding procedure 2 times, letting the dough rest for 15 minutes between each folding session in the fridge.
6. For the filling, mix the marzipan, butter and sugar into a smooth paste and set aside at room temperature.
7. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to 22×14 inches, then cut it in half lengthwise. Spread half the filling evenly, lengthwise, down the centre of the dough rectangle. Fold the plain sides of the dough over the filling. Repeat with the other dough rectangle and the rest of the filling.
8. Push the seams of both parcels gently together and turn them over so they are seam side down.

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1¼ cup all-purpose flour
* ½ tsp baking soda
* ¼ tsp salt
* 1 tbsp matcha powder ceremonial grade
* ⅓ cup unsalted butter browned
* ¼ cup granulated sugar
* ½ cup brown sugar
* 1 egg at room temperature
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 50 g white chocolate chips
* sea salt to sprinkle on top

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Brown the butter first Get a saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Add the butter and brown for approximately 6-8 minutes, or until you see brown bits at the bottom and a little bit of white foaming action on the surface. Once you see this turn the heat off and remove it from the stove. Let it cool down completely.
2. In a small mixing bowl combine the all-purpose flour, salt, baking soda and matcha. Using a sifter sift the ingredients to remove any clumps. The matcha will oftentimes be clumped together. Sifting it will ensure the matcha is evenly mixed to create a vibrant green color.
3. Take a mixing bowl and add the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar and mix until well mixed. Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix until you get a nice light creamy texture. Use a stand mixer to help mix it faster, but a hand mixer will also work fine. It will just take an extra minute or two to get the texture.
4. Add the sifted dry ingredients to the wet and mix with a spatula. Hand mixing will ensure the dough will not raise and fall flat in the oven by adding excess air to the dough.
5. Add the white chocolate chips and mix until well incorporated into the dough.
6. Use a cookie scoop/ice cream scoop 3 tablespoons to scoop the cookie dough (I get 8 cookies with this recipe). I let the cookies rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.
7. Take the cookies out of the fridge and preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
8. Cover your baking sheet with parchment paper and place the cookie dough 3 inches apart. Since this recipe uses less butter I like to roll the dough and press it down to give it a cookie flatten shape. Bake for 10-12 minutes. Take it out of the oven immediately and let it rest for 10 minutes on the baking sheet.
9. Move the cookies to a cooling rack. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/zmcqsx/matcha_white_chocolate_cookies/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/zmcqsx/matcha_white_chocolate_cookies/

These cinnamon sugar roasted pecans are so easy to whip up in big batches. I like to make a bunch around the holidays and give them to friends and family as gifts.

Original Recipe: [https://craftycookbook.com/easy-candied-pecans/](https://craftycookbook.com/easy-candied-pecans/#recipe)

**Ingredients** 

* 1 lb raw pecan halves
* 1 egg white, room temp
* 1 cup white sugar
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1.5 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp water

Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 250° F.
2. In a small bowl combine the sugar, salt, and cinnamon, mix until fully combined.
3. Add the egg white and water to a large mixing bowl and whip them together until the mixture is frothy (I do this by tilting the bowl at an angle and vigorously whipping a fork or whisk side to side).
4. Once the egg white mixture is frothy, add the pecans and toss until they’re evenly coated. Dust about ⅓ of the cinnamon sugar mixture over top, mix well, then repeat until all of the sugar is used, and the pecans are evenly coated.
5. Line a large cookie sheet or jelly roll pan with parchment paper or foil. Spread coated pecans onto the sheet, getting them as evenly spread out as possible. If you are making a double batch, use two cookie sheets.
6. Bake for 1 hour. Once every 15 minutes as the pecans bake, remove them from the oven and mix them around on the sheet.
7. After baking, allow the pecans to cool on the cookie sheet for at least 15 minutes before serving. The pecans will harden and change in appearance slightly as they cool (going from glossy to their finished texture).
8. Wait until the pecans are completely cooled down to put them into any containers. Store at room temp in a sealed container for up to 3 weeks.

Serves 8 - 10

If you would like to make your own lemon curd for this roulade my recipe can be found on my website [here](https://www.leviathanfood.com/recipes/lemon-curd). I would also really appreciate any follows on social media channels if you like the site!

**INGREDIENTS**

* 6 large egg whites
* 335g caster sugar (super fine sugar in the US)
* 300ml rich double cream
* 180ml lemon curd
* 250g raspberries
* 250g blueberries
* 70g crushed de-shelled pistachios
* 2 passion fruit
* fresh mint

**METHOD**

1. Preheat oven to 150°C (300°F). Line a flat tray with parchment paper, you will be baking the meringue on this and don't want it to stick to the surface. I use a 38cm × 35cm tray, but you can use any large flat rectangular tray that will fit into your oven. You will be rolling along the longer edge, so this will be the finished length of your roulade.
2. Add the egg whites and half the caster sugar to a bowl, making sure that it's clean and completely dry before beginning. If there is any moisture left in the bowl, the egg whites won't form. whisk the mixture until it's formed light peaks. Once they have formed, gradually add the other half of the sugar until it forms stiff glossy peaks. This will take about 10-15 minutes. 
3. Spread the meringue mixture evenly onto the lined tray, squaring off the edges as best you can. Place in the oven and bake for one hour. It should be a very light golden colour when it's done. 
4. Remove tray from the oven and turn upside down onto a fresh sheet of parchment paper. Carefully peel off the backing sheet, working slowly and with a knife to scrape the paper gently away in one piece. There will be pockets of carmelised sugar stuck to the paper you want to get all those pieces off as they add a lovely gooey texture. 
5. Whip the double cream until thick and gently fold in the lemon curd, keeping the air you've incorporated during whipping. Spread the cream and curd mix over the flat meringue and cover with a layer of raspberries and blueberries, about 2/3 of the amount. 
6. Make a light score with a knife about 2cm in along one long edge of the meringue, this is going to help you as a starting point to roll it. From the indent, gently roll inwards away from yourself, using the paper underneath to help turn it as you go. You shouldn't be touching the surface of the meringue with your hands, use the paper to do that for you. The ""seam' will sit on the bottom once it's rolled. The outer surface will crack a little bit, you can patch it up if need be once it's served. 
7. When the roll is almost complete, grab the paper and use it to help you transfer the roulade to a plate. It's helpful if you have someone to give you a hand shifting it onto the serving plate, they can hold the plate steady while you transfer. Decorate with the remaining berries, crushed pistachios, passion fruit and mint.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z7gjk9/meringue_roulade_with_lemon_curd_berries_crushed/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z7gjk9/meringue_roulade_with_lemon_curd_berries_crushed/

INGREDIENTS

* 4 Egg Whites large
* 1 cup Sugar Granulated or Caster
* 1/4 tsp Cream of Tartar
* 1/4 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1/2 tsp Peppermint Exact
* Red Gel Food Colouring optional
* 1 cup (140g) Semi-sweet Chocolate melted
* 1 cup (150g) Peppermint Candies

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 225F (200F Convection bake). Line 2x baking pans with parchment paper. Set aside.
2. In the clean bowl of an electric stand mixer, add the egg whites (carefully separated from yolks to ensure no oily, yolk residue).
3. Add the cream or tartar and salt to the bowl. Begin mixing on low. Once frothy, gradually increase the speed to high and begin slowly adding in the sugar (1 tablespoon at a time)
4. After all of the sugar has been incorporated, add the vanilla and peppermint extract.    
Once a stiff peak consistency has been achieved, turn off mixture. 
5. Add small dollops of meringue to the corners of your baking sheet, to prevent the parchment paper from sliding. 
6. Transfer meringue to a piping bag fitted with a large star attachment or with a piping tip of your choice. For added colour, you can add streaks of red gel food colouring to your piping bag before loading with meringue. As you pipe meringue the colour will deposit creating a swirled effect!
7. Pipe your meringues allowing at least an inch of space between each. Bake the meringues on the centre rack of the oven, at 225F for \~1.5 hours. Turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside for an extra 1-2 hour with the door propped open to allow for continued drying. 
8. Dip cooled meringues in melted chocolate then cover in crushed peppermint candies.
9. Let cool fully and enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z4dz1m/chocolate_dipped_peppermint_meringues/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z4dz1m/chocolate_dipped_peppermint_meringues/

Yield: 6 doughnuts. See how I made them [here](https://youtu.be/9DD91_Ex5Aw).

**Ingredients**

Dough

* 75ml warm water
* 7g dry yeast
* 345g all purpose flour
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* Pinch of nutmeg
* 70g sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 egg, room temperature
* 30g unsalted butter, melted 
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 75ml warm milk
* Vegetable oil (for frying)

* 4 apples, peeled and chopped
* 65g brown sugar
* 55g butter
* 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 60g sugar

Icing

* 250g powdered sugar
* 15g butter
* 30g cream cheese, softened 
* 60ml half and half

**Method**

*Dough*

1. Activate the yeast. Mix the dry yeast with the warm water and half a teaspoon of the sugar and set aside for 5 minutes.
2. In a bowl, sift 145g of the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg with the warm milk, melted butter, and vanilla. 
4. Once the yeast is activated, pour yeast mixture and egg mixture into the bowl with dry ingredients and mix well. The mixture will be wet.
5. Sift the remaining 200g of flour into the bowl and mix until incorporated.
6. Turn out the dough onto your working surface and knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is elastic and springy. At the beginning, if the dough is very sticky, lightly sprinkle flour to the prep surface (do not exceed 1 tsp of flour).
7. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover. Allow to rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in size. 
8. Make the filling while the dough is rising.
9. While the filling cools, turn back to the dough. 
10. Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto prep surface and press out air bubbles.
11. Shape into a 1” thick rectangle and divide evenly into 6 pieces.
12. Roll out each piece into a ball and flatten and shape into a bowl shape.
13. Spoon about one heaping teaspoon of filling into the dough bowl and wrap the dough around the filling, pinching tightly to avoid the filling from oozing out. Flatten a bit.
14. Place each filled bun onto a baking sheet and cover. Allow to rest for 30 minutes. While the dough is rising, make the icing.
15. Once the dough has risen a second time, heat the vegetable oil to 375ºF/190ºC.
16. Gently lower doughnuts into the oil and fry for 90-120 seconds per side. Make sure that the oil temp stays at temperature. Do not crowd the pot.
17. While the doughnuts are still hot, dip each one into the icing and place them onto a baking sheet. The icing should firm (not harden) by the time the doughnuts are cool enough to eat.
18. To serve, you can also spoon a bit of the filling on top of the doughnut.  

*Filling*

1. Combine peeled and chopped apple in a pot with brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and sugar. 
2. Heat on the stove on medium heat until the mixture has thickened and the sauce has a syrupy texture.
3. Allow to cool.

**For Banana Ice Cream:**

* 3 bananas
* 50 grams (1/4 cup) of sugar

**Cooking method for pumpkin 🎃 ice cream:**

1. Peel the pumpkin and cut into cubes. Put it in a saucepan and add the ground cinnamon, cloves, sugar and cream.
2. Put on high heat and bring to a boil. When it begins to boil - reduce the heat and simmer for about 13-17 minutes. Then blend the pumpkin until smooth.
3. In a bowl, whisk 4 egg yolks. Then slowly add them to the pumpkin, mixing constantly. Cook for 5 minutes over medium heat, stirring all the time.
4. Pour the mixture into a bowl and place in the freezer for 5-6 hours. Stir it every 30-50 minutes to ensure the ice cream freezes evenly. I recommend using salted peanuts as decoration!

**Cooking method for banana 🍌 ice cream:**

Cut the banana into pieces and put it in the freezer for 4 hours. Then mix them in a blender with the sugar and cream. Add any topping (for example, pieces of chocolate or strawberries), pour it into a mold and put it in the freezer for 5 hours. Stir the ice cream every 30-50 minutes so that it freezes evenly.

**Ingredients**

► Apple Donut Batter

• 70g Applesauce

• 140ml milk

• 10ml white vinegar

• 300g Flour

• 2 tsp baking powder

• 2g salt

• 2eggs

• 150g sugar

• 5ml vanilla extract

• Vegetable oil for frying

**The instructions**

◇Step 1 - Donut batter

1. Mix in a bowl, the flour, baking powder, and salt &amp; set aside
2. Start by mixing milk and vinegar &amp; set aside
3. In a bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract for about 5 minutes or until the mixture gets light and doubles in volume
4. Add the applesauce
5. Add the dry ingredients in 3 times while alternating with the milk
6. When the batter is homogeneous refrigerate for 30 minutes

◇Step 2 - Frying

1. In a bowl, mix the sugar and cinnamon
2. Put the cinnamon sugar on a plate
3. Pour the oil into your saucepan until it gets to 2 inches from the bottom
4. Preheat the oil to 350°F
5. Use an oiled ice cream spoon of the capacity of 1tbsp to scoop your batter
6. In our case we had one too big so we used a pastry bag to fill half of the spoon - You don’t need to be this extra! Just put the equivalent of 1 tbsp of batter in the hot oil
7. Bake for about 3-4 minutes or until the donuts get golden brown
8. Don’t forget to turn them so both sides are cooked!
9. To make them perfect we used scissors to cut off the excess - Once again, this is not essential, but we are perfectionists xD
10. When these are baked to perfection put them on absorbent paper to collect the excess oil
11. Then roll them in the cinnamon sugar while they are still hot!
12. We highly recommend trying them fresh and still warm! That’s when they are at their best!
13. Enjoy :)

* 1 tsp Vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp Cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp Nutmeg

9. Leave at least an inch of distance between each meringue kiss on the baking sheet.  
Bake the meringues on the centre rack of the oven, at 200F for 1.5 hours. (The meringue cookies are done when they are dried throughout and lift easily from the parchment).

Fluffy sponge rolled with strawberry jam and whipped cream, covered in a chocolate shell. See how I made it [here](https://youtu.be/r4VqvQHI_gI).

**Ingredients**

* 4 eggs, room temperature
* 100g caster sugar
* 100g cake flour
* Tsp vanilla extract
* 500ml whipping cream
* 50g caster sugar
* 6g powdered gelatin
* 4 tbsp cold water
* 125-150g strawberry jam
* 250g semi sweet chocolate
* 90g unsalted butter
* Pinch of salt

**Method***Sponge*

1. In a mixer bowl, beat eggs, 100g caster sugar, and vanilla.
2. Put the mixer bowl in a warm water bath and mix well until the mix has warmed.
3. Mix on medium-high until fluffy and pale (10 minutes).
4. Sift and fold in cake flour in batches, ensuring each batch is fully mixed in before adding more flour. Be careful not to deflate the batter
5. Line a baking pan with parchment. Pour in the batter and spread evenly. Drop the pan onto the prep counter a couple of times to remove air bubbles.
6. Bake at 180ºC/355ºF for 10-12 minutes, until lightly golden.
7. While the sponge is baking, dust a clean tea cloth generously with powdered sugar.
8. When the sponge is done baking, immediately invert it onto the tea towel and remove the parchment. While still hot, roll up the sponge gently (with the tea towel as if they were one) and allow to cool completely in rolled form.

*Chantilly*

1. Bloom the gelatin. Dust the gelatin powder into the cold water and mix well to remove any lumps. Put the gelatin dish in an ice water water bath.
2. Whisk the whipping cream and sugar until lightly fluffy and set aside.
3. Remove the gelatin dish from the ice bath and put it in a hot water bath and stir until it is fully liquid.
4. Scoop 1/3 of the whipped cream in a separate bowl. Add the gelatin and mix well until incorporated (careful not to overmix).
5. Return the gelatin and cream to the whipped cream bowl and mix well until it reaches a thicker (but not over mixed) consistency.

*Assembly*

1. Once the sponge is totally cooled, unroll it gently, remove the tea towel, and set the sponge on a sheet of parchment. Spread a layer of jam, followed by a layer of whipped cream on the sponge.
2. Gently roll into shape, taking care not to squeeze the filling out of the sides. The parchment can help guide the form, but should not be rolled into the cake.
3. Wrap the cake in the parchment sheet, and refrigerate for 4 hours minimum and up to overnight. For longer refrigeration, cover the cake to prevent it from drying out.

*Chocolate shell*

1. Melt the chocolate and butter in a double boiler and add salt. Mix until liquid.
2. Remove the chilled cake from the refrigerator and set on a grate/rack. For neater edges, trim the sides of the cake to achieve a straight edge. Pour the chocolate onto the cake, taking care to cover the sides where it curves under.
3. Refrigerate 1 hour before serving.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/y31qie/gansitostyle_roll_cake_sponge_filled_with/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/y31qie/gansitostyle_roll_cake_sponge_filled_with/

* 20 gr ground pistachios
* Raspberries  


&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTIONS**  
Crust:

1. For this cheesecake, I used a flat plate, rather than a pan, and an adjustable cake ring. Use a 9-9.5 inch plate.
2. Put the pistachios (cleaned) in the food processor and grind them, but not very finely.
3. Add the biscuits and continue to grind until the mixture is smooth.
4. Add a spoonful of sugar and the melted (but cooled) butter.
5. Mix well with a spoon until you get a homogeneous mixture. If the dough is too crumbly, add 1-2 tablespoons of milk.
6. Place the adjustable ring on the plate and try to avoid it moving as you put in the biscuit crust.
7. Even out the biscuit crust, and press down with a spoon, being careful not to move the ring. Refrigerate.Raspberry cream:
8. Put the raspberries (they can be frozen) in a saucepan with water and boil until it begins to thicken.
9. Add the sugar and cook until it approaches the consistency of jam.
10. Turn off the heat and leave to cool for an hour.Cream cheese:
11. Mix the cheese with 100 gr (3.5 oz) powdered sugar in a saucepan over the heat until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is warm.
12. Rehydrate the gelatin in 30 ml (1 fl. oz) of cold water.
13. Leave for 5 minutes, then pour over the cream cheese and mix well. Add the vanilla extract.
14. Refrigerate the cream until it hardens slightly, i.e. it has a creamy appearance, but is still liquid enough to mix without lumps.
15. Whip the cream with the remaining 30 gr (1 oz) of powdered sugar. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese.
16. Remove the biscuit crust dish from the refrigerator.
17. Top with the raspberry cream and level well.
18. Over the raspberry cream, spread the cream cheese and level again.
19. Refrigerate the cheesecake until the next day.Decorations:
20. After 24 hours, take the cheesecake out of the fridge and run a thin-bladed knife between the cream and the ring.
21. Take the knife full circle and carefully remove the ring.
22. Melt 50 gr (1.75 oz) white chocolate with a tablespoon of oil in bain marie.
23. When completely melted, use the chocolate to decorate the cheesecake.
24. To make it even prettier, sprinkle the top with ground pistachios and decorate with fresh raspberries.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/y1bf3i/raspberry_pistachio_cheesecake/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/y1bf3i/raspberry_pistachio_cheesecake/

* 1 1/2 cup (340g) Unsalted Butter
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1/2 cup (70g) Chocolate Cookie crumbs finely ground

  
**INSTRUCTIONS**

  
**Oreo Cupcakes**

1. Preheat oven to 350F (convection bake 325F). Line 2x cupcake pans with paper liners. Place an Oreo cookie on the bottom of each cupcake holder. Set aside.
2.  In a small bowl, whisk flour and corn starch together to sift and aerate mixture. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl or in the bowl of an electric stand mixer, combine butter, oil, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix on low speed to combine. Gradually increase speed to medium for \~3 minutes. Mixture will look light in colour and creamy. Scrape down sides of bowl.
4. Add eggs and vanilla extract to the mixture. Once incorporated, slowly add 1/3 of flour mixture to the wet batter. Next, add ½ of buttermilk mixture. Repeat flour and buttermilk steps, finishing with addition of the flour mixture. Scrape down sides of bowl.
5. Add chocolate cookie crumbs to the batter. Mix one final time to incorporate.
6. Scoop 1/4 cup of batter into each prepared cupcake liner (with an oeo at the bottom). Bake cupcakes for \~25 mins or until toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Note: while cupcakes are baking, begin making Swiss Meringue Buttercream!
7. Let cool for 5 minutes in cupcake pans then move cupcakes to wire baking rack to cool completely.

  
**Cookies &amp; Cream Frosting**

1. Prepare one batch of Swiss Meringue Buttercream (full step-by-step recipe and trouble shooting tips on the blog). A condensed recipe version is shown in steps below.
2.  Clean bowl of your electric stand mixer. Add egg whites and sugar to the clean electric mixer bowl. Place bowl over double boiler – the bowl should not be touching the water). Whisk sugar and egg whites until the mixture is frothy and sugar has dissolved (\~5 min). Check the temperature with a candy thermometer – when ready, the mixture will be at 160F (71C).
3. Return egg white mixture to stand mixer. Whisk on medium-high speed. Beat until glossy, stiff, peaks form and mixture is no longer warm to the touch (\~10 min). Once meringue has cooled, replace whisk attachment with a paddle attachment and reduce mixer speed to LOW.
4. Begin adding butter. Continue until all butter has been added. Over the next 10-20 minutes, the mixture will turn from a smooth, loose mixture, to a curdled mixture, to one that barely pulls away from the bowl, and then ultimately to a smooth, sturdy buttercream! Continue to beat for another 3-5 min on LOW or fold by hand to remove excess air bubbles.
5. Add 1/2 cup of chocolate cookie crumbs to the prepared vanilla Swiss Meringue Buttercream. Scrape down sides of bowl and mix to incorporate cookie crumbs.
6. Top each cupcake with generous amount of frosting and decorate as desired (I like to sprinkle cupcakes with extra chocolate cookie crumbs and place a piece of Oreo on top!)",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/xsw31m/oreo_cupcakes_with_oreo_swiss_meringue_buttercream/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/xsw31m/oreo_cupcakes_with_oreo_swiss_meringue_buttercream/

* 220g granulated sugar
* 115 Greek yogurt
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 egg, room temperature
* 250ml milk, room temperature

**Frosting**

* 200g unsalted butter, room temperature
* Pinch of salt
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 3 tbs whipping cream

**Coating**

* 400g candy melts, white chocolate, or milk chocolate
* Coconut oil or commercial thinning flakes, to thin the coating if needed
* Sprinkles, if desired.

*METHOD:*

**Sponge**

1. In a bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and salt and mix well. Set aside.with a stand or hand mixer, beat butter and sugar. When sugar is fully incorporated, add yogurt, vanilla, egg, and milk and mix thoroughly.
2. Slowly add the dry ingredients and mix on low until fully incorporated.Pour the batter into two 8’ pans lined with parchment paper.
3. Bake at 350ºF/176ºC for 25-30 minutes. The cake will be done when a toothpick is inserted and comes out clean.
4. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, invert the cakes onto a cooling rack and allow to cool completely.

**Frosting**

1. Beat butter. Sift in powdered sugar in batches and mix well in between.
2. Once sugar is fully mixed into the butter, add the salt and vanilla extract and mix.
3. Add the whipping cream, about a tablespoon at a time, and beat on high until frosting is even and fluffy.

**Cake Ball Assembly**

1. Crumble the cake evenly into a bowl. Remove any tough pieces.Add approximately 75-100g of frosting. Mix until the frosting is evenly distributed among the cake, ensuring the cake retains a crumbly texture.
2. To test, gently squeeze some of the mix into a ball. If it retains its shape, it should be ready.Roll into 30g balls and place onto a lined cookie sheet.
3. Refrigerate for 2 hours minimum.

**Coating**

1. Melt the candy melts/chocolate. If it is too thick, it can be thinned down with refined cocounut oil or commercial thinning flakes. Add just a little at a time and mix well to avoid cracking or an uneven finish.
2. Dip a lollipop stick into the coating and insert the stick into the cake ball.
3. Dip the cake ball into the coating and gently tap the side to remove excess.
4. Spoon sprinkles onto the cake pop.
5. Insert the stick into a styrofoam block and allow the coating to set for 1 hour minimum.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/xiljp1/cake_pops/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/xiljp1/cake_pops/
xebazh,Dark Chocolate Coated Nutty Buddies,1369,20,1663184717.0,0.98,Dessert,yellowjacquet,https://i.redd.it/dur3cnsjovn91.jpg,"# Dark Chocolate Coated Nutty Buddies

Time: \~20 min

Makes 12 bars, \~250 cal per bar

**Ingredients**

* 12 Nutty Buddy wafer cookies (made by Little Debbie, 1 standard package)
* 8 oz dark baker’s chocolate\*\*
* Flaky sea salt optional, for topping

\*\* make sure you use a chocolate that will melt nicely, most chocolate chips don't melt well for coating so look for bakers chocolate bars

**Instructions**

1. Place the Little Debbie Nutty Buddy box in the freezer at least a few hours before preparing (I typically do this the night before I plan to make them). Begin with frozen bars. If the twin wrapped bars are frozen together, allow them to warm up on the counter for a few minutes, then they should be easy to separate.
2. Prepare simmering water in the lower portion of a double boiler. Break the chocolate up into pieces and place it in the top of the double boiler. Mix frequently with a small silicon spatula until fully melted.
3. Meanwhile, line a cookie sheet with parchment or wax paper.
4. Remove the bars from the freezer 1 to 2 at a time and coat in a thin layer of chocolate. *My recommended technique:* Use a fork to support the underside of the bar as you dip it into the melted chocolate. Use a silicon spatula in your other hand to make sure the bar is fully coated. Lift the bar above the chocolate using the fork and allow excess chocolate to drip off, gently scraping off excess chocolate with the silicon spatula. Place the coated bar on the prepared baking sheet, then continue until all the bars are coated.
5. Optionally – drizzle extra chocolate over the bars for a more aesthetic look. For this to work, the original chocolate coating must be set. You can place the coated bars in the fridge or freezer to set the chocolate faster (I use the freezer). Scoop up the remaining melted chocolate using a spoon or spatula and drizzle it over the top of the bars as pictured. 
6. When the chocolate is mostly set, top with flaky sea salt if desired. 
7. Serve bars at room temp, fridge temp, or frozen. Store in an airtight container at room temp or in the fridge. To store long term, freeze the bars on a wax or parchment paper lined baking sheet so they are not touching. Once frozen, transfer to a freezer safe zip bag.

* ¾ cup sugar (¼ for the crust and ½ for the batter)
* ½ tsp. Vanilla (use real vanilla extract)
* 3 x 8 oz. “bricks” of Philadelphia cream cheese (“full fat”)
* 4 tbsp. (½ stick) butter (not margarine)
* 3 large eggs
* 2 cups graham cracker crumbs (you could try chocolate cookie crumbs)
* ½ pint “half-n-half"" cream
* 24 oz. Nestles white chocolate morsels (4 cups)
* Spray-on oil (Pam)

Let the cream cheese warm overnight. Let the eggs warm for an hour.

1. Set up a double-boiler and add the white chocolate morsels and half-n-half. Stir occasionally.
2. In a small pot, put the butter on a low heat to melt.
3. In a small mixing bowl add the Graham cracker crumbs and ¼ cup sugar, and mix thoroughly.
4. In a large mixing bowl add ½ cup sugar, the vanilla and the cream cheese.
5. Mix in the three eggs one at a time, mixing as little as possible; you just want to distribute the eggs through the mixture. I use a large serving fork, and only “pull” through the cream cheese 3 times for each egg.
6. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
7. Spray a springform pan with a medium-to-heavy coat of spray on oil.
8. Add the melted butter to the smaller mixing bowl and mix thoroughly. “Dump” the small mixing bowl contents into the springform pan, distribute evenly, and tamp down lightly and evenly with something with a flat bottom (I use a drinking glass). Only press down with about 18 to 20 pounds of pressure.
9. Stir the chocolate until it's fully melted. Add the melted chocolate to the large mixing bowl.
10. Using a hand mixer on the lowest setting, mix the batter until the largest “shreds” of cream cheese you can see are about 1/8 inch long.
11. Pour the batter into the springform pan, and cover with aluminum foil. Lightly crimp the foil around the top of the pan all the way around.
12. Place in the oven for 1 hour.
13. After the hour, shut the oven off and prop the door open very slightly; don’t open it to the first “detent” (about 3 inches); I use the handle of a wooden spoon inserted as little as possible to keep it in place. After two hours, take the cheesecake out of the oven and put it on the counter for two hours.
14. Take off the foil; at this point you will think the it's “underdone”. The middle will have the consistency of cheesecake pudding. Release the “lock” on the springform pan and use a dinner knife to separate the cheesecake from the pan by running it around the inside edge of the pan. Then open the lock fully and lift the outer part of the pan off the base.
15. Put it in the refrigerator at least 12 hours, 24 is better.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/wwdx4c/white_chocolate_cheesecake/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/wwdx4c/white_chocolate_cheesecake/

Little maple almond flour tarts get baked, cooled, and then filled with the most simple and delicious whipped yogurt filling. Top it with some red raspberries and blueberries for a delicious dessert. Here's a [link to the full recipe + video](https://www.nataliecooks.com/free-cooking-club-recipes/whipped-yogurt-berry-tarts) instructions and notes

**IngredientsFor the almond flour crust:**

* 3 tbsp (42g) butter
* 3 cups (336g) almond flour
* ¼ cup (80g) maple syrup
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* ½ tsp kosher salt

**For the whipped yogurt:**

* 1 cup heavy whipping cream
* 2 cups plain whole milk Greek yogurt
* 2-4 tbsp powdered sugar, cane sugar, or maple syrup
* \*½ tsp vanilla extract (optional)

**For the toppings:**

2 cups mixed berries

Other topping ideas: banana slices with crumbled up graham cracker on top, Strawberry Rhubarb Sauce, grated chocolate + crumbled graham cracker, sprinkles, etc…

\*The best sugar to use for this is powdered sugar because it mixes in well and doesn’t change the color like maple syrup and coconut sugar. However, they are all good options. Make it more or less sweet to match your preferences!

**Instructions**

1. Preheat the oven to 350F.
2. Line a standard muffin pan with 12 parchment muffin cups.
3. In a medium microwavable bowl, add the butter and microwave in 15 second intervals until melted.
4. Add the almond flour, maple syrup, cinnamon, and salt and mix to combine until a sticky crumbly dough forms.
5. It’s best to use your hands at the end to make sure everything is well mixed.Divide the mixture between the muffin cups (about 2 tablespoons per cup), then use your fingers to press it down and up the sides of the muffin cup.
6. It’s important to press the dough enough so that it goes all the way up the sides for the whipped yogurt to go into.
7. Start by pressing the bottom and then work up the sides (watch the video!). If it’s sticking to your fingers too much, dip them in water and keep molding!
8. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the edges turn light golden. The bottoms may puff up and crack a bit - that’s fine!
9. If the cracks are big, you can press gently to try and make the dough stick together but once it firms up it will be fine.
10. Let cool completely before adding the whipped yogurt.In a large bowl, add the whipping cream and use an electric beater to beat on high until stiff peaks form (about 2-4 minutes).
11. Add in the yogurt, sugar, and vanilla (if using) and beat until combined and fluffy (just about 30 seconds).
12. Taste and add more sweetener, if needed.
13. Add a scoop of whipped yogurt into each (completely cooled) tart cup so that it fills almost to the brim.
14. Top with berries (or whatever toppings you want) and dig in! I also like to sprinkle a bit of salt on top at the end.

**Note:** It’s best to make the tarts the day before so they can cool (store in an airtight container on the counter) and then make the whipped yogurt fresh and fill them when it’s time to eat!Fun idea!

**DIRECTIONS**  
**TO MAKE BLACK SESAME ICE CREAM**  
1. Mix together the condensed milk, Rooted Fare Black Sesame Crunchy Butter and salt in a bowl.  
2. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy whipping cream until nice and stiff. It will take about 10 minutes by hand or 2 minutes using a mixer.  
3. Take one tablespoon of the whipped cream and mix it into the black sesame mixture to lighten a bit. Then fold in the rest of the whipped cream in 2 batches until it’s nice and smooth, but still fluffy. Don’t over mix.  
4. Pour into a container you can put in the freezer. Leave to freeze overnight.

  
**TO MAKE HALO HALO**  
1. Get two 16 oz. glasses and divide the nata de coco between the two glasses.  
2. Layer the diced strawberries on top of the nata de coco.  
3. Divide the shaved ice between the two glasses and top with black sesame ice cream.

* 2 1/2 sticks butter
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 cup water
* 1 cup white sugar
* 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup honey

**Directions:**

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9×13 inch pan.
2. Chop 14 oz walnuts and toss with 2 teaspoons cinnamon. Set aside.
3. Unroll package of phyllo dough. You might need to trim the edges to fit your pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered.
4. Sprinkle a handful of the walnut/cinnamon mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, and walnut mixture again, layering as you go. The final top layer should be about 6 – 8 sheets deep.
5. Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows then cut across, and then make the diagonal cuts. It helps to rinse knife and finger every couple of cuts. That keeps the knife and your fingers from sticking to the top layer.
6. Bake for about 40-50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.
7. Make syrup while baklava is baking. Heat 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water until sugar is melted. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla and 1/2 cup of honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently and keeping eye on pot to make sure it doesn’t boil over.
8. Remove baklava from oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. You won’t need all of the sauce. Let cool. Serve in cupcake papers.

It is chilled for a few hours before serving. This dessert is delicious yet easy to make.

My mom would make this for special occasions such as Christmas and Birthdays.

The mangoes bring freshness to this sweet dessert. I must admit it's my favorite Filipino dessert.

[Step-by-step video instruction](https://youtu.be/o_385-41uKA)

**Ingredients**  


* Two cups heavy cream chilled
* Four tablespoons condensed milk
* One pack graham crackers
* Two pieces mangoes sliced and cubed
* One cup milk

**Recipe steps**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Pour the whipping cream into a medium-sized bowl
2. Use a handheld electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment
3. Whip the cream on medium speed for about five minutes
4. Gradually pour the condensed milk while mixing
5. Add more until you get the desired sweetness 
6. Mix until well-combined
7. Pour the milk into a bowl
8. Dip each graham in the milk, then place them into a rectangle-shaped glass dish. I use a ten-inch dish for this recipe
9. Place enough graham crackers to form the first layer at the bottom of the dish
10. Next, evenly spread a cup of whipping cream on the top of your graham crackers
11. Then, put a layer of diced mangoes on top of the cream
12. Repeat by covering the mangoes with graham crackers. It's ok to cut the crackers to fit 
13. Then cover with another layer of cream and top with more mangoes
14. Flatten the layers
15. Add one more layer of graham and cover with cream
16. I like to add crushed Grahams for a final touch
17. Cover with plastic wrap

After many attempts, from a tiny cookbook my grandma gave me, to BBC Good Food, and even this subreddit, I have found the perfect one (so you guys don’t have to).

[link to recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-fudgy-homemade-brownies)

**Ingredients**

- 1/2 cup (115g) salted or unsalted butter

- two 4-ounce (226g) semi-sweet chocolate bars, coarsely chopped

- 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar

- 1/4 cup (50g) packed light or dark brown sugar

- 3 eggs 

- 1/2 cup + 2 Tablespoons (79g) all-purpose flour (spoon &amp; leveled)

- 2 Tablespoons (10g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder

- 1/4 teaspoon salt

**Important to note**

I didn’t add vanilla extract OR chocolate chips because i didn’t have any, but the recipe says you can! I also used the grams measurement.

**Directions**

1. Measure your butter and chocolate out in a big bowl, then stick it on top of a saucepan with water (also known as a bain-marie) to melt it. Then, let the mixture cool, otherwise you’ll cook the egg.

2. Once mixture is cool, whisk in (I used a stand-mixer, but a good old handheld metal one will be fine, you’ll just end up super hench) the sugar and eggs. 

3. Make sure to use a sieve to sift in your salt, cocoa powder and flour. Then use a spatula to fold in the dry ingredients, don’t whisk!

4. Add your mixture to a lined tray (I line mine with baking powder, I don’t like just greasing it) and evenly spread out the mixture you have managed not to eat.

5. Bake in the oven at 180 degrees celsius (pls google the F equivalent) for about 25 minutes, after 20 I usually stick a butter knife in. You want your knife to come out with bits of crumbs and goo, but not too much. You **DONT** want the knife to be clean.

6. Leave to cool (I don’t have a cooling rack to I put about an inch and a half of cold water into my sink and put the tray in there so it was half submerged). 

They’re nice to eat warm, cold etc. Just don’t store them in the fridge, otherwise they’ll go hard and weird.

Mix together chopped strawberries and sugar and carefully place them over the cream cheese.
6. Transfer to oven and bake for 25-30 minutes until the edges are puffed up and pastries are golden brown in colour. 
7. Drizzle some honey or syrup (optional) and enjoy!

**Ingredients:**

* 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter
* 3/4 cup Light Brown Sugar
* 1/4 cup Granulated Sugar
* 1 tbsp Heavy Cream or your milk of choice! (ideally with a high fat content)
* 1 Egg large
* 2 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1 1/4 cup All-purpose Flour
* 1 tsp Baking Soda
* 1/2 tsp Salt + extra pinch for tops of finished cookies!
* 1 cup Mixture of Semi-sweet and Milk Chocolate roughly chopped

**Instructions:**

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
2. In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt butter. Swirl pan every 30 seconds until butter begins to sizzle. Reduce heat to low. Continue swirling for \~3 minutes or until melted butter becomes foamy, makes popping sounds, and begins to take on a nutty aroma! Mixture will begin to turn golden brown and have brown flakes interspersed. Using a wooden spoon or spatula stir butter, lift browned butter bits from the bottom of the pan. Remove from heat and allow to cool. In the meantime, move onto step 3.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. (This process aerates and sifts dry ingredients!) Set aside.
4. Using a large bowl with an electric mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat sugars (brown and granulated) with melted brown butter and heavy cream for 1 min. Add in egg and vanilla extract. Stir until combined and scrape sides of bowl once more to incorporate all the batter.
5. Slowly add flour mixture to the wet butter/sugar/egg mixture, beating on low speed until just combined. Add roughly chopped chocolate pieces to the batter. Stir until combined.
6. Scoop dough into 2 tbsp portions and set on flat plate/baking sheet.
7. Refrigerate dough for at least 1h (this step allows all of the beautiful cookie flavours to combine and form a perfectly spread cookie!)
8. Preheat oven to 350F (325F if using convection bake).
9. Once dough is chilled, remove from fridge and place cookies onto baking sheet, spaced 2"" apart.
10. Bake cookies at 350F for 12-14 min or until the edges are golden brown (mine were perfect after 13 min at 325F convection bake).
11. Sprinkle each cookie with flaked salt upon removing from the oven!

v3wzlx,Classic Victoria Sandwich Recipe,305,9,1654254499.0,0.98,Dessert,JonnyPap,https://i.redd.it/icxrdcv82e391.png,"**Introduction**

A classic Victoria Sandwich recipe - not a Victoria sponge, that wouldn't be proper. Recipe follows the basic ""pound cake"" recipe of equal parts eggs, sugar, flour and fat.

You can watch the [instructional video here.](https://youtu.be/6lkuOMUS-Z0)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients**

For the sponge:

* 4 large eggs
* 133g margarine
* 133g butter
* 266g caster sugar
* 266g self-raising flour

For the filling

* 300ml double (heavy) cream
* Raspberry jam

To serve

* Cup of tea (optional but recommended)

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions**

1. Pre-heat the oven to 160C and grease and line two 8-inch cake tins.
2. Cream together the sugar and fat until pale yellow, light and fluffy
3. Beat in the eggs one at a time - don't add them all at once or your batter will separate.
4. Mix in the self-raising flour then divide the batter between the two cake tins and bake for 25-30 minutes until golden brown and cooked through
5. Remove from the oven and allow to cool fully on a cooling rack - about 2 hours.
6. Whisk the cream until stiff and then spread onto one of the sponges, then add jam, top with the second sponge and dust with icing sugar and enjoy

&amp;#x200B;

**Tips**

* You can add vanilla extract to the cream for a little more flavor
* Mrs Pap thinks the jam should go on before the cream - I think it tastes better my way!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/v3wzlx/classic_victoria_sandwich_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/v3wzlx/classic_victoria_sandwich_recipe/

You can see how I made it [here](https://youtu.be/bMT7ijRrJU4)

*Ingredients*

**Cake:**

* 220g all purpose flour
* 60g cocoa powder
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 300g granulated sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 240ml whole milk, room temperature
* 1 tbsp white vinegar
* 2 eggs, room temperature
* 100g vegetable oil
* 250ml boiling water
* \~500g fresh strawberries

**Ganache:**

* 350g chocolate
* 200ml whipping cream
* 30g unsalted butter
* Pinch of salt

*Directions*

***For the cake:***

1. Mix milk and vinegar and set aside for \~5-7 minutes, until the milk curdles. Preheat oven to 176ºC/350ºF.
2. In a large bowl, sit flour and cocoa powder, add baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt. Mix well.
3. In a separate  bowl, mix eggs, vegetable oil, and curdled milk.
4. Mix the wet and dry mixtures until uniform. Slowly add boiling water while whisking until the water is fully incorporated. Continue whisking until the batter is uniform (no lumps).
5. Line cake pans with parchment paper. I use cake strips to keep the cake from doming. Pour the batter equally among the 2 pans. Each pan should not be more than 2/3 full.
6. Put both pans on one cookie sheet and bake for 30-40 minutes. Cake is ready when a toothpick is inserted and comes out clean.
7. Once they are done baking, cool pans for 10 minutes on a cooling rack, then take the cakes out of the pans and set them on the cooling rack to cool completely (at least 1 hour).
8. Once the cakes are cooled, cut them into 2 layers each.
9. Wash, hull, and halve all but 3-4 strawberries. Chop or cut the remaining strawberries and set aside to eventually decorate the top, i.e., in a pile or a design.

***For the ganache:***

1. Melt the chocolate, cream and butter in a bain marie, then stir in the salt.
2. Turn off the heat. Once fully melted, set aside 225g of the ganache and chill (preferably until set, but it can be a little liquid).
3. Put the remaining bowl with ganache back on the saucepan (without turning on the heat) until the cake is assembled. If it sets, melt it until it’s liquid.

***Assembly:***

1. Place one cake layer, then arrange the strawberry halves horizontally flat side down around the edge of the cake.
2. Pipe the chilled ganache in the center, filling any gaps between the strawberries.
3. repeat with the next cake layer.
4. Place the final layer on top.
5. Pour the warm ganache over the top of the cake, allowing/pushing some of the ganache so that it drips over the sides.
6. Top with the cut/chopped strawberries.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/v3q8p6/mudslidestyle_chocolate_cake_with_chocolate/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/v3q8p6/mudslidestyle_chocolate_cake_with_chocolate/

**CRUST:** 

* 2 1/2 cups flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 6 tbsp unsalted butter, chilled and cubed
* 2/3 cup vegetable shortening, chilled
* 1/2 cup ice water

**FILLING:** 

* 2 cups hulled and chopped fresh strawberries
* 8oz cream cheese, softened
* 1 egg
* 1/2 tsps vanilla extract
* 1 cup plus 3 1/2 tbsp sugar
* 3 tbsp cornstarch

&amp;#x200B;

**CRUST INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Preheat oven to 450 F. Mix flour and salt together in a large bowl, then add the butter and shortening.
2. Mix all of the ingredients until mixture resembles coarse sand. You can do this with your fingers, a fork, or a food processor. Whatever works!  

3. Add ice cold water one tbsp at a time to the mixture until there is just enough moisture that the dough begins to stick to itself and forms large clumps. You don't wanna see any dry bits.  

4. Transfer the dough onto a floured surface, and fold the dough into itself using floured hands. The dough should not be overly sticky and should come together easily. Cut the dough in half, and form two discs. Cover with plastic wrap and store in fridge for at least one hour but up to 5 days if you wanna save it for later.  


**FILLING INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. In a food processor, process strawberries with cornstarch. Add puree and 1 cup sugar to a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat until the mixture becomes thick like jam. Set aside.
2. In medium bowl, combine together egg, vanilla, cream cheese and 3 ½ tbsp of sugar with a hand mixer until light and fluffy. Set aside. If it looks a lil clumpy, that's okay!  


**ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Roll pie dough out flat onto a floured surface and cut out rectangle shapes until there is no dough left, making sure to cut an even numbered amount so you have enough top and bottom layers to complete the hand pies.
2. To the bottom layers of the pies, spoon some of each filling mixture down the center of the pie, making sure to stay clear of the edges so the pie doesn’t overflow.
3. Place the top layer of dough on top of the filled bottom layer, and press the edges together with your fingers to seal the pie. Cut a slit down the center of the hand pie.  

4. Brush each pie with egg wash and place in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.  

5. Enjoy!

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (2¼ sticks) cold salted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* ¼ cup (packed) light brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
* 6 ounces semisweet or bittersweet dark chocolate, chopped (but not too fine, you want chunks, not thin shards of chocolate)
* 1 large egg, beaten to blend
* Demerara sugar (for rolling)
* Flaky sea salt

**Directions**

1. Line a rimmed baking sheet (two, if you’ve got ’em) with parchment paper.
2. Using an electric mixer and a medium bowl or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, both sugars, and vanilla on medium-high till it’s super light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Using a spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and, with the mixer on low, slowly add the flour, followed by the chocolate chunks, and beat just to blend.
3. Divide the dough in half, placing each half on a large piece of plastic wrap. Fold the plastic over so that it covers the dough to protect your hands from getting all sticky. Using your hands (just like you’re playing with clay), form the dough into a log shape; rolling it on the counter will help you smooth it out, but don’t worry about getting it totally perfect. You can also do this using parchment paper, if you prefer, but I find using plastic wrap easier when it comes to shaping the log. Each half should form two logs 2 to 2¼ inches in diameter. Chill until totally firm, about 2 hours.
4. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
5. Brush the outside of the logs with the beaten egg and roll them in the Demerara sugar (this is for those really delicious crispy edges).
6. Slice each log into ½-inch-thick rounds, place them on the pre-pared baking sheet(s) about 1 inch apart (they won’t spread much), and sprinkle with flaky salt. Bake until the edges are just beginning to brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly before eating them all.

**Notes**

* The cookie dough can be made ahead and stored, tightly wrapped in plastic, up to 1 week in the refrigerator, or 1 month in the freezer.
* Cookies can be baked and stored in plastic wrap or an airtight container for 5 days.
* I recommend Maldon flake salt.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/uohk7b/salted_butter_chocolate_chunk_shortbread_by/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/uohk7b/salted_butter_chocolate_chunk_shortbread_by/

- Milk 500ml  
- Sugar 90g  
- Agar- Agar Powder 7g  
- Milk Chocolate 150g  
  
Recipe:  
1. Mix Milk, Sugar, and Agar-Agar Powder until dissolved in a pot  
2. Cut Milk Chocolate into small pieces, add into pot  
3. Boil the mix until thick  
4. Pour into a rectangular mold, cool down for 1 hour, fridge for a few hours  

TIPS

* Using milk chocolate gives you the unmissable sweetness, but if you're a fan of dark chocolate, then just replace and add a little more sugar to balance things out.
* Use a spatula to help pry it loose from the mold, it should come out pretty easily after the sides have been loosened
* Eat it as is, or with whipped cream for that texture differential.
* The pudding is much much better cold, so be sure to keep it in the fridge for a few hours after it has cooled down. DO NOT KEEP THE HOT PUDDING IN THE FRIDGE, it will raise the temperature of the fridge significantly, giving possibility to spoil other things.

tshd9f,Tarte Tatin - Upside down plum tart,180,4,1648670326.0,0.94,Dessert,JonnyPap,https://i.redd.it/curtu2rnrkq81.jpg,"  
**Introduction**

Tarte Tatin is an upside down pastry dish traditionally made using apples but I've use plums here for a sweet, jammy dessert.

There's an instructional video [here](https://youtu.be/Xe2UkwVKCQc) if you'd like to watch.

**Ingredients**

* 75g Sugar
* 40g Butter
* 300g Plums - halved and de-stoned
* 1 sheet shop bought puff pastry.

**Instructions**

1. Melt the sugar over a medium heat in an oven safe until it begins to caramelize. Don’t stir it but give the pan a shake every once in a while.
2. When the sugar has melted, turn off the heat and add the butter. Use a wooden spoon to mix in but be careful, the mixture will be VERY hot.
3. When the butter and sugar is combined, add the fruit cut side down and leave to cool for about 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, roll out the pastry slightly and cut around a dinnerplate that’s a similar size to the pan and gently lay the pastry over the plums, tucking the edges under with a blunt knife. 
5. Give the pastry a few pricks and bake in the oven at 200C for 25-30 minutes until golden brown.
6. Remove from the oven, allow to cool for a couple of minutes and then loosen the edges before flipping onto a plate. 
7. Serve with cream and enjoy.

  
**Tips**

* Can be made with apples or apricots. 
* Eat warm but the topping will set as it cools so if it’s too damp when turned you might want to leave for a little while.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tshd9f/tarte_tatin_upside_down_plum_tart/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tshd9f/tarte_tatin_upside_down_plum_tart/

tr0i9j,French Burnt Custard AKA Crème Brûlée,761,18,1648562700.0,0.96,Dessert,unitedcuisines,https://i.redd.it/yrjxq2zqxbq81.jpg,"Creme Brulee, also known as burnt cream, is a French dessert consisting of a tasty vanilla custard base, topped with a layer of hardened, caramelized sugar.

If you have a sweet tooth and never had Creme Brulee before, I bet that you will love it! 

*INGREDIENTS*

*  heavy cream \[2 cups / 450 ml\]
* 5 fresh eggs
* 1 vanilla pod (alternatively, 1tsp vanilla extract)
* fine caster sugar \[1.9 oz / 50 g\]
* raw cane sugar \[a few tsp\]

*METHOD*

1. Pre-heating the oven to 160Celsius or 320Fahrenheit
2. Pour the heavy cream into a saucepan. Cut the vanilla pod along the long side, scrape the little vanilla beans out, transfer into the saucepan and stir. Add the remaining vanilla pod in there, too
3. Separate the egg white from the yolk, place the yolk into a bowl and the egg white into a storage vehicle of your choice for your personal use later
4. Drop the caster sugar into the bowl, grab a whisk and combine well
5. Grab the saucepan and, over medium-heat, bring to a slight boil, till small bubbles arise. Stir frequently and don’t scorch the cream
6. Start tampering the egg yolks: pour a small batch of the hot cream into the bowl holding the yolk and whisk immediately till fully incorporated NOTE: Don’t rush it! Or you run the risk of ending up with scrambled eggs here. We did it in eight batches and took a 2-3 minutes of time for it
7. Run the cream-yolk-vanilla mix (custard) through a mesh sieve in order to filter out the vanilla pod. Use a plastic spatula and make sure not to leave any valuable vanilla beans behind. Grab a spoon and discard the foamy layer on top of the cream
8. Place ramekins into an oven-safe form and distribute custard cream evenly. It should almost fully fill up two ramekins of around 12cm (5inch) in diameter and around 2cm (a bit short of 1inch) in height
9. Bring some water to a boil and pour it into the oven-safe dish that holds the ramekins. Cover half of ramekins in hot water. 
10. Transfer into the middle of the oven and place a baking sheet one layer above – it will protect the top of the custard base from burning/hardening. The custard shall cook for 25-35 minutes, till its core temperature reaches 80 degrees C or 175 F. It will not fully firm up, but rather remain jiggly in the center
11. Remove from the oven and take ramekins out of hot water. Let cool down a bit and transfer into the fridge, where the custard shall set and chill for at least 6 hours, better overnight
12. An hour before you want to serve, take custard base out of the fridge, evenly spread 1-2 teaspoons of raw cane sugar on top and patiently and gently burn it with a kitchen torch, till the sugar caramelizes
13. Transfer into the fridge for 45-60 more minutes and let melted sugar harden before serving – plain or with fruit

For the cigars:

* 3 filo pastry sheets
* 25g of butter

5. Repeat with the remaining pastry and then bake for 8-10 minutes at 200C / 400F then allow to cool slightly.
6. For the cream combine the ingredients and whisk until thick enough to cling to a spoon but not fully whipped.
7. Dust the cigars with icing sugar and serve with the cream.

Get ready to grab a spoon and dig in, totally safe to eat and you won’t be able to put that spoon down! You won’t believe how easy it is to make this cookie dough!  
video recipe [here](https://youtu.be/yO2uAJSlwoM)  
**INGREDIENTS**  
\* 2 cups All-purpose flour  
\* 1 cup Cake flour  
\* 1/2 cup Granulated sugar  
\* 1 cup Brown sugar  
\* 1 Cup butter (2 sticks)  
\* 1 cup mini chocolate chips  
\* 3/4 Cup milk, plus more as needed  
\* 2 tsp vanilla extract  
**INSTRUCTIONS**  
Preparing the flour  
1. Add all of the flour to a pan and turn the pan on medium high heat. Using a whisk, start mixing and shaking the pan ever so often.  
2. Continue to roast until the flour is heated through and has darkened ever so slightly. The flour is ready when it smells similar to popcorn and doesn't appear dusty anymore - it should develop some texture. About 12-15 minutes.  
3. Once done, immediately move the pan off the heat. Mix every 2-3 minutes to prevent any residual heat from burning the flour.  
Making the cookie dough  
1. Soften the butter by microwaving for 20-30 seconds on high. In a large bowl, add in the sugars and butter. Start your stand mixer with the paddle attachment and run on medium speed. It will take about 30 seconds to a minute. You can also use a hand mixer.  
2. When you have a smooth texture like peanut butter, add the 1/2 of the milk and all of the vanilla and mix again. Mix until the dough looks nice and fluffy and the colour is much paler. It will take about 30 seconds to 2 minutes.  
3. Start adding in the flour, little bit at a time while you continue to mix on low speed. Continue to mix until you have added all of the flour and the dough has come together. If the dough appears crumbly or dry, add more milk, 1 Tbsp at a time.  
4. Once the dough has come together, stop the mixer and add in the chocolate chips. Continue mixing until they are well combined. The dough should be soft and smooth - add more milk as required to achieve this texture.  
5. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 20 minutes. Scoop the cookie dough and enjoy!  
Notes: Don't leave the pan unsupervised at any point, the flour will burn and turn the cookie dough bitter.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tiu2p5/chocolate_chip_edible_cookie_dough/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tiu2p5/chocolate_chip_edible_cookie_dough/

**Dough**

* 86 grams graham cracker crumbs finely ground
* 228 grams all-purpose flour plus more for dusting
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 50 grams butter
* 132 grams granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

**Graham Cracker Crust**

* 30 grams butter
* 40 grams graham cracker crumbs, finely ground
* 13 grams granulated sugar

**Cheesecake**

* 1/2 large egg (preserve other half for egg wash)
* 113 grams cream cheese
* 50 grams granulated sugar
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 20 canned cherries for garnishing

**INSTRUCTIONS**

**Dough**

* Combine the flour and ground graham cracker crumbs with the baking powder, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl.
* In a mixing bowl, combine the soft butter with the sugar until they cream. Then, add the eggs and vanilla to combine.
* Using a wooden spoon, spatula, or stand mixer, mix in the dry ingredients to form a dough. Divide the dough in half and pat it out into discs and wrap them in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least two hours or up to one day.

**Filling**

* Make the graham cracker crust by melting the butter and using a fork to mix in the graham crumbs and the sugar. Set aside.
* Beat the sugar, egg, cream cheese, and vanilla until well blended. Set aside in refrigerator so it becomes more solid.

**Bake**

* Preheat the oven to 350F or 175C and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
* Dust some flour on your workspace and roll out one disc of dough at a time until it's between 1/3 and 1/2-centimeter thick. Add more flour as necessary to prevent sticking.
* Cut out 3” or 7.5cm circles (I use the rim of my whiskey glass), re-rolling scraps as needed. Brush the edges with egg wash. Scoop 1 teaspoon of graham cracker crust and pack it into your spoon. This will help it stick together. Then plop it in the center of your hamantaschen and flatten slightly with the back of your teaspoon. Top that with 1/2 teaspoon of cream cheese. At this point, you can optionally add your cherry on top or save it for the end. If adding it now, be sure to press it slightly into the center. It might fall to the side while baking if it's left gently on top.
* Fold the edges up to form a triangle shape, pinching the corners firmly to seal. Then brush the edges with egg wash.
* Place on the baking sheets, 1 inch or 2.5 centimeters apart. Bake until the dough is lightly browned, about 17 minutes.
* If you haven't already, top each hamantaschen with a canned cherry and press it gently into the center of the cream cheese. Let cool for about five minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. After another five minutes, you can dive in!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tb4bpg/graham_cracker_cherry_cheesecake_hamantaschen/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tb4bpg/graham_cracker_cherry_cheesecake_hamantaschen/

Enjoy this light and fluffy vegan lemon cake with dairy-free lemon frosting for a sweet and tangy treat.

Prep Time: 1 hr

Cook Time: 40 mins

Resting/Cooling Time: 2 hrs

Total Time: 3 hrs 40 mins

Servings: 12

**Ingredients**

**Dry ingredients for the cake:**

* 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
* 1 ¾ cups cake flour
* 1 ½ cups granulated sugar
* 1 tbsp baking soda
* ½ tsp salt

**Wet ingredients for the cake:**

* ½ cup soy milk, or other plant-based milk
* ⅔ cup lemon juice, or juice of 4 lemons
* ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
* ½ cup plus 2 tbsp oil
* 2 tbsp vanilla
* 3 tbsp packed grated lemon zest, from about 3 lemons

**Vegan Lemon Buttercream Frosting:**

&amp;#x200B;

* 2 cups vegan butter or margarine, (stick not spreadable in a tub)
* 8 cups confectioner’s sugar, sifted
* 1 tbsp vanilla
* ¼ cup fresh lemon juice, from about 2 lemons
* 1 tbsp bottled lemon juice, or 1 - 2 tsp lemon extract
* 2 tbsp packed grated lemon zest, from about 2 lemons
* 8 to 14 drops Lemon Yellow food colouring

**To Decorate:**

* Dried Lemon Slices

**Instructions**

**Cake:**

1. Line three 6-inch cake pans with parchment. I recommend using cake strips for a more moist, even bake. Soak in water until ready for use. Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C.
2. Add the sugar to a large bowl of a stand mixer, then sift in the remaining dry ingredients.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the liquid ingredients including the zest until fully combined.
4. Add the bowl of dry ingredients to the stand mixer and while mixing on low, gradually pour in the wet ingredients.
5. Mix for about 30 seconds or until most of the flour is just moistened and the batter is smooth with a few tiny lumps.
6. Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a large spoon or silicone spatula to mix in any dry flour. Don’t overmix.
7. Evenly distribute the batter between the cake pans. If using cake strips, squeeze out excess water, wrap around each pan and secure.
8. Place the pans in the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes with cake strips or about 20 to 25 minutes without. A skewer or toothpick inserted should come out clean.
9. Fully cool the cakes in the pans before removing them.

**Lemon Buttercream Frosting:**

1. Add the vegan butter and confectioners’ sugar to the stand mixer bowl.
2. Add the bowl to the stand mixer and mix on low while gradually adding the lemon juice and vanilla.
3. When smooth and creamy, remove about ¼ cup of the frosting and set aside. Add the lemon zest and lemon extract to the remainder.
4. Add enough food colouring to get your desired shade of yellow. The colour may darken as the frosting dries.

**To Assemble:**

1. Filling a piping bag, or zip-top bag with the corner snipped, with yellow frosting.
2. Dab a bit of frosting on a cake board, stand or plate. Place the first cake layer on the board.
3. Pipe a swirl of frosting on top, without gaps. Spread evenly then add the second cake layer.
4. Add another swirl of frosting, then the final layer, bottom side up.
5. Spread the top and sides with a thin layer of frosting to crumb coat. Place in the fridge for one hour or until the frosting is chilled.
6. Spread the sides and top with the remaining yellow frosting and smooth.
7. Dab some of the reserved white frosting at random spots on the cake. Smooth to add white streaks.
8. Place the dried lemon slices on the cake and add dots of the remaining white frosting with a #2 piping tip.

**Notes:**

* Warm lemons for about 20 seconds in the microwave, before cutting, for easier juicing.
* Scrape the mixer beater as long strands of zest may stick to it.
* Bottled lemon juice usually has citric acid added which can help add extra tartness and lemony flavour.

12. Heat your deep fryer oil to 170 degrees
13. While the oil is heating up leave your donuts to raise again.
14. When the oil is heated up lower in your donuts carefully into the hot oil.  

15. Do your donuts in batches of two or three at a time depending on the size of you fryer.
16. The donuts take about 1 minute each side, when one side is done turn over and fry the other side.
17. When golden brown remove the donuts from the oil and place onto a plate with a couple of squares of kitchen roll, this will help soak up any excess oil.
18. Place donuts onto a wire rack to finish cooling.

**To make the donut frosting**

1. While your donuts are cooling it’s the perfect time to make your double chocolate topping. First add in the powdered sugar, sifted cocoa powder, vanilla essence and 4-5 tablespoons of milk into a Pyrex bowl and simply mix your ingredients together really well.
2. Now to melt your white chocolate, add a small amount of boiling water to a saucepan and put on to your hob on a low heat, top with a glass bowl and brake your chocolate into chucks and melt it by stirring slowly. When the white chocolate is melted remove from the heat.

**How to frost the donuts**

1. Your donuts should be cool now and ready for you to top. First dip your donuts into the chocolate frosting and put them back onto the wire rack. When all your chocolate frosted donuts are covered grab a teaspoon and your bowl of melted white cholate and drizzle slowly over the top of all your donuts.
2. That’s it your double chocolate donuts are done! all that’s left is to wait a while for the toppings to set and serve.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/s0lkgg/double_chocolate_frosted_donuts_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/s0lkgg/double_chocolate_frosted_donuts_recipe/

This easy apple cake recipe is so easy to make that you can whip one out at a moment's notice. The best part of this apple dessert? The crunchy turbinado sugar topping.

Prep Time: 20 minutes

Baking Time: 50 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour 10 minutes 

Servings: 8 

Calories: 255kcal

### Equipment

* 1 9"" Round Cake Pan
* Parchment paper if needed
* Hand mixer

### Ingredients

* 2 medium apples such as Pink Lady, Fuji, SugarBee, or Gala
* ½ cup unsalted butter room temperature
* ⅔ cup granulated sugar
* 3 eggs
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons whole milk
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1½ cups cake flour or use all-purpose flour
* 2-3 tablespoons turbinado sugar

### Instructions

#### Preheat oven to 350ºF.

#### Prepare the baking dish:

* If using, line the dish with parchment paper and grease the sides of the dish. If not using parchment paper, grease the entire baking dish and set aside.

#### Prepare the apples:

* Core the apples and quarter them. Place each quarter, cut side down, on the cutting board. Slice each quarter into 1/8'' slices. Keep each sliced apple quarter intact so you can easily place them right on top of the cake when ready (refer to the photo).

#### Prepare the cake batter:

* Place the butter in a mixing bowl and use a hand mixer to mix for 1 minute until fluffy. Add the sugar and mix for 2–3 minutes until fully incorporated.
* Add the eggs one at a time and mix after each addition until fully incorporated.
* Add the vanilla extract, lemon juice, salt, and baking powder and mix again. Add the milk and mix once more until incorporated. It's okay if the mixture appears to be lumpy or curdled.
* Add the cake flour and mix until just incorporated. Do not overmix the batter!

#### Bake the apple cake:

* Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and smooth it out with a rubber spatula. Carefully pick up each sliced apple quarter (keeping the quarters intact as seen in the photo) and place all the sliced apple quarters cut-side down on top of the cake.
* Scatter the turbinado sugar on top of the cake.
* Transfer to the oven and bake for 45 minutes or until a toothpick pierced into the center of the cake comes out clean.

#### Broil (or torch) the turbinado sugar:

* Turn on the broiler. Broil the cake for 1–3 minutes, being careful not to burn the top, until the sugars begin to melt. Remove from the oven. Alternatively, use a blowtorch to melt the sugars.

#### To serve:

* Let the cake cool and then slice and serve with whipped cream or whipped crème fraîche. Enjoy!

rdhspn,Iced Oatmeal Christmas Cookies,138,8,1639168118.0,0.99,Dessert,fantasycookery,https://i.redd.it/yurydtxqyr481.jpg,"# Ingredients

***Cookie Dough***

* 240 grams all-purpose flour
* 4 grams baking soda
* 3 grams kosher salt
* 200 grams rolled oats
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
* ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom
* ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
* 226 grams unsalted butter, room temperature (2 sticks)
* 200 grams light brown sugar
* 150 grams white sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 tablespoon good quality vanilla
* 135 grams pecan pieces
* 100 grams white chocolate chips

***Brandy soaked cranberries***

* 1 tablespoon orange zest
* 1 cup dried cranberries
* ¼ cup cognac or brandy

***Icing***

* 200 grams confectioners' sugar
* 3 tablespoons whole milk
* 1 teaspoon good quality vanilla

# Instructions

1. In a medium container with a tight fitting lid combine orange zest, cranberries, and cognac - stir together. Allow mixture to sit on the counter overnight (up to 12 hours).
2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and cover several full size baking sheets with parchment paper.
3. In a medium-sized bowl mix together flour, baking soda, kosher salt, oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and ginger - set aside.
4. In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment (or a large bowl if that's unavailable), add room temperature butter and both sugars - mix together until smooth and fluffy. Next, mix in the egg and vanilla until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and gently fold in all of the dry ingredients. The mixture will seem dry, but don't worry - the dough will hydrate during resting time.
5. Divide the cookie dough into roughly 1.5 ounce segments using a spoon or medium cookie scoop (you can weigh them if you want but it's not necessary), roll each segment into a ball, and place the balls onto a prepared cookie sheet. Bake cookies for about 14 - 16 minutes. Finished cookies will have light brown edges with a slightly soft center. Cool directly on baking sheet.
6. In a shallow wide dish (I used a shallow cake pan) mix confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla. Mix until icing is thick. To decorate, either gently dip the tops of the cookies into the icing or use a spoon to drizzle the icing on top of the cookies. Frosting will set in about an hour. Store in an airtight container. Cookies are best eaten within 5 days.

***Honey cake layers:***

* Eggs - 3(150g)
* Salt - 3g
* Granulated sugar - 180g
* Honey - 150
* All-purpose flour - 600g
* Baking soda - 12g
* Unsalted butter - 90g

***Sour cream frosting:***

* Heavy cream 33% - 400
* Vanilla extract
* Powdered sugar - 200g
* Sour cream 30% - 800
* Lemon juice\\zest

***Honeycomb decoration:***

* White chocolate - 150g
* Yellow food colouring
* Honey

***Preparation:***

1. Line a strainer or a small colander with cheesecloth. Set this contraption over a deep container or bowl (so that the whey can strain out the bottom without touching the strainer). Put the sour cream into the strainer and cover tightly with plastic wrap or a plastic bag and put it in the refrigerator until it has a thick texture and some amount of whey liquid has been released(at least 24 hours but up to 2 days).
2. Add granulated sugar, honey, unsalted butter, eggs, salt and baking soda to a medium saucepan and melt them together over medium/low heat, whisking occasionally until sugar is completely dissolved. Don’t put them over high heat to prevent boiling.
3. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a standing mixer with the paddle attachment. Then add sifted all-purpose flour and start mixing for a few minutes on a medium speed until the dough reaches a clay consistency and doesn’t stick to the bowl.
4. Cut the dough into 15 equal pieces(77g each) and let it chill for a few hours or overnight in the fridge.
5. Take your dough out of the fridge and let it warm up a little bit. On a well-floured surface, roll each piece out into a thin 22cm circle. You can sprinkle the top with a little flour too to keep dough from sticking to your rolling pin.
6. Using a cake ring(you can use a lid from a saucepan) cut each dough circle to make a perfect shape. Keep the scraps for later! Place each dough circle on a parchment paper and pierce with a fork all over the surface to prevent air bubbles. Bake in the oven at 200C(392F) for 6-7 minutes until golden brown. Let them cool completely.
7. Finally, bake the scraps separated evenly on a re-used sheet of parchment. Once the scraps are baked, cooled and firm, you can crush them with a rolling pin or pulse them in a food processor until you have fine crumbs.
8. Beat heavy cream with powdered sugar until fluffy and stiff peaks form (1-2 min on high speed). Add strained sour cream and mix gently. You can also add vanilla extract, lemon zest or juice to your taste.
9. Place the first cake onto a turntable and top it with 6-8 tablespoons of frosting; spread it gently and equally until its surface is completely covered. Place the next cake over the frosting layer without pressing it down. Repeat the process until all the layers have been stacked and topped with the sour cream frosting. Frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting.
10. Dust the top and sides with your cakecrumbs, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. This cake needs time to absorb some of the cream and soften, so be patient. It’s worth the wait!
11. Place finely chopped chocolate in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 15 seconds; remove the bowl from the microwave and stir. ... - Repeat the process until most of the chocolate has melted and is smooth. At this point add yellow food coloring and mix everything thoroughly.
12. Place the bubble wrap bubble-side up on a flat surface. Pour the chocolate on top of the bubble wrap. Spread it fairly thick: you don't want to see the shape of the bubbles beneath. Let it chill out in the fridge. Gently peel off the bubble wrap. Cut it with a cake ring 2-3cm smaller than the actual cake.
13. Place chocolate honeycomb on top of the cake. Using a star nozzle, pipe swirls of frosting around the top of the cake. You can also fill hexagonal cells with honey.

***Preparation:***

1.Preheat the oven to 180C(350F). Prepare a 18cm(7-inch) baking pan; set aside.

2.Sift dry ingredients together. Place sugar, eggs and salt into a mixer bowl and whisk until light and fluffy. Add dry ingredients(in 2 batches) into the batter and mix on a low speed. Add milk and melted butter and continue mixing. At the end add boiling water and mix until well combined.

3.Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and put it in the oven and bake for 40min until done. Insert a toothpick into the center of the cake if it comes out clean, it is done. Remove from the oven and turn the cake over onto the cooling rack. When the cake is completely cooled, cover it with plastic cling wrap and put in the fridge to rest overnight.

4.Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Put the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring it to a gentle boil. Do not stir the caramel. Gently swirl the pot to even out the sauce. Cook the caramel until it is a golden-brown color. Remove from the heat and add hot milk while whisking. Leave it aside to cool down a little then add the butter and salt, mix well till everything is incorporated.

5.Beat heavy cream with powdered sugar, cream cheese and vanilla extract until thick and smooth.

6.Using a large serrated knife, level the top of the cake and split into 3-4 layers of equal thickness.Using a palette knife, spread about 3-4 tablespoons of the frosting evenly across the bottom layer. Using a round piping nozzle, pipe a ring of frosting around the edge of the cake.Spread a layer of the caramel in the middle of the cake, then sprinkle with crushed shortcake biscuits. Repeat for the next layer.

7.Top the cake with the final layer, and spread the cream cheese frosting on the top and sides of the cake. Use a palette knife or cake side scraper to take off the excess buttercream and give a smooth finish. Chill the frosted cake for 15 minutes in the fridge, to allow the layer of frosting to firm up.

8.Add another layer of frosting to the top and sides of the cake, and remove the excess. Chill the frosted cake for another 15 minutes in the fridge.

9.Pour heavy cream into a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave on high until very hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chocolate chips to heated cream; whisk until smooth. Set aside to firm up a little – you want the ganache to be pourable but not too runny.

10.Fill the piping bag or squeeze bottle with the ganache you’ve made. Place the edge of the piping bag on the edge of the cake and gently squeeze the bag – the more you squeeze the more it will drip. Make it all around the cake.

11.Using a star nozzle, pipe swirls of frosting around the top of the cake; then spread another layer of the caramel, and sprinkle with crushed shortcake biscuits.

12.Top each swirl with a piece of Twix mini-bar.

https://www.thespeltkitchen.com/spelt-brownie-christmas-trees/

INGREDIENTS

Brownies

• 200g butter (chopped)


• 100g dark chocolate


• 100g milk chocolate


• 100ml brewed coffee (or milk)


• 3 eggs


 • 120g brown sugar


 • 120g white sugar


 • 80g spelt flour (see notes)


 • 30g cocoa



Decoration

 • 8 candy canes

 • icing (make your own or use store bought)

• sprinkles or any other kind of decoration



INSTRUCTIONS

Brownies

1. Grease a 9"" springform pan (line the bottom) and preheat the oven to 175°C.

2. Add the butter and both chocolates to a pan and gently heat until just melted. Add the brewed coffee, stir and set to one side for a short time.

3. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and sugars together. Add the melted chocolate/butter mixture and stir until combined.

4. Combine the flour and cocoa and stir into the wet ingredients just until everything has come together.

5.  Pour into the prepared pan and bake for around 25 minutes. The top will feel very firm but an inserted skewer is not completely clean. When ready, remove from the oven. Wait ten minutes and then remove the springform sides, then allow to cool completely (you may find and hour or two in the fridge will make it easier to slice).


Assembly/Decoration

1. Slice into eight wedges (as you would a normal cake).


2. Chop the bottoms off the candy canes and stick them into the long side of the wedges. Cover with whatever you are using to decorate. Enjoy!


NOTES

• I use metric (grams and decilitres) in my recipes because scales are the most accurate way to measure ingredients. At one time, I did convert to cups, but as these are not the same all over the world, felt that I wasn't comfortable converting myself.


• I used spelt in my brownies but you could do a straight swap with regular or gluten free (ready blended) flour.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/qz1wbu/brownie_christmas_trees/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/qz1wbu/brownie_christmas_trees/

**Ingredients:**

**FOR THE PIE CRUST:**

* Coconut oil spray
* 7.41oz Whole Package of Laura's Ube Otap or substitute with Magic Melt Ube Otap
* 4 Tablespoons Melted Butter

**FOR THE UBE COOKIE BUTTER FILLING**

* 8oz Marscapone Cheese
* 8oz Ninong's Ube Cookie Butter with 1oz reserved

**FOR THE TOPPING**

* 1/2 Cup Ready made Frozen Coco Whip
* 1 Goldilocks Ube Polvoron or  substitute with House of Polvoron - Ube Polvoron

**DIRECTIONS**

**FOR THE PIE CRUST**

* Prepare the pie plate by spraying it all over with coconut oil.
* Take out all the Otap from it’s wrapper and place them all in the food processor.  The Otap is quite hard so hold it down while you pulse until you get super fine crumbs.
* Turn off the processor and add in the melted butter.  Pulse again until the mixture resembles wet sand.
* Pour mixture onto the prepared pie plate and press the crumbs down with the bottom of a water glass.
* Fix the edges with your fingers as best as you can making sure the edges of the pie plate is covered in crumbs.
* Note:  If you don’t have a food processor, you can place the Otap in a 1 gallon zip lock bag and smash the cookies with a wooden spoon until you have fine crumbs.  Note, don’t leave big chunks.  Once you have the fine crumbs add the melted butter in the ziplock bag and zip it up.  Shake until the crumbs are covered in butter and looks like wet sand.  Follow the rest of the directions.

**FOR THE UBE COOKIE BUTTER FILLING**

* Place the marscapone in a large bowl and mix with a wooden spoon until the lumps are gone.
* Add in the 7oz Ube Cookie Butter and mix well again until smooth.
* Take the pie crust out of the freezer and pour in the filling.  Smooth out top with a butter knife.
* Dot the remaining Ube Cookie butter all over the top in random places.  Using a clean butter knife make swirls with the Ube Cookie butter  by dragging the knife down and around and side to side.
* Place in the freezer for 3 and a half hours.Meanwhile, defrost the ready made coco whip in the refrigerator.
* Just before serving, take the Ube Pie out of the freezer and top with the coco whip.  Crumble the Polvoron in the bag, then take some out and sprinkle on top.

qgzb8d,Placinta cu Mere {Romanian “Apple Pie” Cake},57,4,1635348628.0,0.98,Dessert,Supersmaaashley,https://i.redd.it/jiihpl1gh0w71.jpg,"[Full recipe (and others) here.](http://fromdilltodracula.com/recipe/placinta-cu-mere-romanian-apple-pie-cake/)

**Ingredients**

***Cake***

* 8 tbsp butter (or margarine)
* 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* zest of one orange
* juice of one orange
* 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* a pinch of salt

  
***Filling***

* 4 apples 
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1 tbsp cinnamon
* 3.5 tbsp butter (or margarine)

**Directions**

1. Leave a stick of butter out on your counter for about an hour, or until it reaches room temperature.  
(While you're waiting for the butter to soften, you can always get a head start on the recipe by working on the filling — instructions begin in step 5.)  
In a large bowl, combine wet ingredients: butter, Greek yogurt, sugar (not a traditional ""wet"" ingredient, but it goes here), vanilla extract, zest and juice of one orange (if using the same orange, you'll want to zest before cutting into the orange, and squeezing for its juice).
2. In another bowl, combine dry ingredients: baking powder and salt with flour. Slowly add dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredient mixture, kneading until dough is combined and elastic when stretched out. The dough will knead a little love to work the dry ingredients through it. Oh, that pun was very much intended.  
Dough too dry? Add a splash of water. Too wet and sticky? A little more flour should do the trick.
3. Divide dough into two equal parts and form into a ball. Wrap both with plastic wrap and move to the refrigerator, chilling for at least 30 minutes.
4. While dough is chilling (or if you're waiting for your butter to soften) wash and then grate apples using the coarse edge of your grater (the side with the large holes).  
I prefer to leave the skin on—it contains most of the apple's nutrients, after all—but if that's not your jam, feel free to peel the apple before you grate it.
5. Using a tea towel or paper towel, squeeze as much liquid as you can from the grated apples.  
My preferred method is putting the grated apple in a strainer, covered with a doubled-up paper towel, and then pressing the liquid out with the weight of a couple bowls resting on top of the paper towel. You can leave the apples to drain while you work on other parts of this recipe.  
You won't believe how much liquid comes out of these apples!
6. In a large bowl, combine grated apples with the cinnamon and sugar. Stir until well-combined.
7. Heat 3.5 tbsp butter (or margarine) in a saucepan. Add grated apple, cinnamon and sugar mixture to the pan, and cook until tender, approximately ten minutes. The mixture will look and smell like the caramel on a caramel apple. No judgement if you taste a bit of this step, just make sure it cools off, first!
8. Set aside mixture, and let cool. I return it to the same bowl I used to create the grated apple, cinnamon and sugar mixture, minimizing how many bowls I use.
9. When you remove the dough from the refrigerator, begin by pre-heating the oven to 350°F.
10. Grease or butter a 9x9"" cooking dish or baking tray. Stretch out one ball of dough so it's pressed into the bottom of the dish, covering the dish from edge to edge. Using a fork, prick it all over. Cook for 30 minutes.  
**Note**: If you have two dishes of the same size, that will fit side-by-side in your oven, you can cook both pieces of dough at the same time. If not, I like to leave the second ball of dough in the fridge. It won't hurt the dough by staying in longer.
11. Allow to cool on a cooling rack while repeating step 11 with the other ball of dough.  
Spread cooled apple mixture evenly over the bottom piece of cake while the top piece is cooking.
12. Once the top piece of cake is cooked, allow it to cool and then place on top of the apple mixture that's already spread over the bottom piece.
13. The traditional Romanian topping is dusted with powdered sugar, but can you imagine the variations you can try? Drizzled homemade caramel with crushed walnuts, a cinnamon and sugar crumble, a layer of thin-sliced apples . . . the options are endless!   

14. If you do choose to go the traditional route, the best way to do so is with a flour sifter.

They even designated 21st July as National Lamington Day. They are super soft and go very well with a cup of tea or coffee!

**Enjoy the recipe and United Cuisines on Youtube!**

INGREDIENTS \[20 Lamingtons in 9x9 in / 22 x 22 cm baking pan\]

For the batter:

\- 4 eggs

\- fine caster sugar \[150 g\]

\- all purpose flour \[1.5 cups / 180 g\]

\- baking powder \[1 tsp\]

\- unsalted butter \[2 tbsp / 25 g\]

For the coating:

\- powdered/icing sugar \[2.5 cups / 250 g\]

\- cocao powder \[5 tbsp / 30 g\]

\- unsalted butter \[2 tbsp / 25 g\]

\- milk \[1/2 cup / 120 ml\]

\- desiccated coconut flakes \[3 cups / 200 g\]

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Start by greasing your baking pan, properly line it with parchment paper and set aside. Pre-heat oven to 350°F / 180°C
2. To make the batter for the sponge cake, grab an electric mixer and a big bowl, crush the eggs and add the fine sugar. Begin whisking and beat the mass for a few minutes, till it drastically increases in size by almost 200%. Once the color desaturates and the batter turns less runny and starts to stick to your whisk, you can stop
3. Begin to gently incorporate the all purpose flour and baking powder, which you put into a mesh strainer and sift 1/4th of it over the batter. Gently fold it into the batter with a wooden spoon or spatula. Repeat the step 3 times with the remaining flour
4. Melt 2 tbsp of butter and fold it into the batter, as well as a teaspoon of vanilla extact, if you like
5. Transfer the batter into your lined baking pan and spread it all over, before giving it 1, 2, max 3 good tappy taps, in order to bring big bubbles to the surface. Don't overdo it, though! Remember, we created those many small bubbles on purpose, in order to get a spongy cake
6. Place in the middle of your pre-heated oven and bake for 15-25 minutes, depending on the oven and what sort of pan, glass or metal, you use
7. In parallel, take a medium-size bowl and combine the sifted icing sugar and sifted cocao powder
8. Pour the milk into your saucepan, add the butter and heat up together, till butter is melted and milk hot. Add it to the bowl and mix well, till sugar and cacao are dissolved. Let rest till completely cooled down
9. Get the cake out of the oven once done and place it on a cooling reck. Remove the parchment paper, and let cool down completely
10. Depending on your baking pan, the cake might end up with uneven edges, which you shall level, before cutting the whole cake in into beautiful squares of around 2 inch / 5 cm. You should end up with 20 pieces
11. Get two bowls ready, distribute 1/3 of the cacao-sauce in one and 1/3 desiccated coconuts in the other. Coat the sponge cakes well in the cacao sauce first, preferably use forks, elevate and let drain for a few seconds over the sauce-bowl, before dropping them into the coconuts. Use a spoon or your hands to fully cover the cakes in white coconuts flakes and transfer them on a rack to rest
12. Enjoy!

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour 5 minutes 

Servings: 24 bars 

Calories: 187kcal

## Ingredients

* 2½ cups all purpose flour
* 1½ teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1 tablespoon kafe hawaij or pumpkin pie spice
* 1 cup unsalted butter at room temperature
* 1 cup light brown sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 15- ounce can pumpkin puree
* 1 cup labneh
* ⅓ cup granulated sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* ¼ cup maple syrup

## Instructions

* Preheat oven to 350ºF.

## Prepare the dry ingredients:

* In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and kafe hawaij (or pumpkin pie spice).

## Prepare the wet ingredients:

* Place the unsalted butter in a large mixing bowl and beat with a hand-mixer until whipped and smooth. Add the brown sugar and continue mixing until combined.
* Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat for 1 minute.
* Add the pumpkin puree to the wet ingredients and beat until just combined and smooth.

## Combine the wet and dry ingredients:

* Slowly pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Do NOT overmix. It will look a bit lumpy and not as smooth as cake batter, and that's okay. Wash off the beaters.

## Prepare the baking sheet:

* Line the baking sheet with parchment paper, leaving an overhang of paper on all sides.
* Add half the pumpkin mixture to the baking sheet, using a rubber spatula to smooth it out. Set aside.

## Prepare the labneh mixture:

* Wipe out the bowl used for the flour.
* Place the labneh in the bowl. Mix on high with the hand mixer until smooth. Add the sugar, egg, maple syrup, and vanilla extract and continue mixing until completely smooth. Taste and add more maple syrup if you prefer a sweeter labneh.

## Finish preparing the baking sheet:

* Using a spoon, drop half the labneh mixture over the layer of pumpkin mixture and use a toothpick to create a swirl pattern.
* Pour the remaining pumpkin mixture on top and smooth it out with a spatula. It won't be perfect but that's okay! Drop the remaining labneh mixture on top and smooth it out once more and ensure the mixture goes edge-to-edge.

## Bake the pumpkin bars:

* Transfer the baking sheet to the preheated oven for 35–45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

## To serve:

* Allow the bars to cool completely before cutting. Serve with whipped cream and a dusting of kafe hawaij.
* Store the bars in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

Yield: 12 Rolls

If you'd like to see any part of this process, I've made a video, divided by chapters and you can click [here](https://youtu.be/COqDYsxOpHw) to go directly to it.

**Ingredients:**

Dough:

* 350g all-purpose flour
* 200g pumpkin puree
* 60g warm water
* 60g warm 2% milk
* 3 tbsp butter
* 2 1/4 tsp (1 pkg) dry active yeast
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt

Pumpkin Pie Spice:

* 1/2 tsp cloves
* 1 tsp allspice
* 3/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp ginger
* 1 tbsp cinnamon

Filling:

* 1/4 cup margarine (or butter, but I always forget to leave extra out)
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1 recipe \^\^\^ of pumpkin pie spice (roughly 2 tbsp)

Maple Cardamom Icing:

* 4 oz. warm cream cheese
* 1/4 cup 2% milk
* 60g maple syrup
* 1/4 tsp cardamom seed, ground
* 2 tbsp icing sugar

**Preparation:**

1. Mix together water, milk, yeast and 1 tbsp brown sugar.
2. When yeast is nice and foamy, add in all remaining dough ingredients except for 175g (or half) of flour and use a wooden spoon or paddle attachment to mix until combined.
3. Add remaining flour and knead in stand mixer on medium-high for about 5-6 minutes.
4. When dough is smooth and elastic, set aside in greased bowl to rise until doubled in size, approximately 1 hour.
5. While the dough is resting, you can make the spice mixture and icing by just combining the ingredients listed.
6. When dough has doubled in size, flour the top lightly, press out majority of the gas, and flip out onto a generously floured table.
7. Roll dough into a rectangle roughly 1/8 inch thick. You can either flour the top of the dough lightly or a rolling pin for this. I floured my dough.
8. Brush rolled out dough with 1/4 cup of margarine or soft butter, (I used margarine because my memory is similar to that of a goldfish and it's spreadable straight from the fridge) then evenly spread brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice overtop of the margarine.
9. Starting with one of the long sides, gently roll the dough up tightly, trying to avoid large gaps or air bubbles that may make the rolls fall apart.
10. Cut the resulting log into 12 equal pieces and set them cut sides down in a 9 inch oven-safe pan, covered, for 45 minutes to proof.
11. Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 20-25 minutes, until nicely browned and cooked through.

Once the mixture is soaked in butter, get a 9 inch springform pan and grease it generously with canola oil or a non stick spray. 

Pour in your buttery cracker mixture and using a cup or any other dish that has a flat bottom spread(flatten) it out evenly. 

Now place your crust in to a preheated 175 degree celcius oven for 8 to 9 minutes.

Remove it and let it cool until its cooled completley.

For the filling get a big bowl and in that bowl add in 900 grams of softened cream cheese.

Mix and add in around 190 grams of granulated white sugar.

Keep mixing your cream cheese and add in 4 whole eggs and one egg yolk one by one.

Once you've done that mix in 60 milliliters of heavy whipping cream, 50 grams of creme frieche or Sour cream, 7 grams of vanilla extract or around same amount of vanilla sugar, 20 grams of corn startch and a pinch of salt.

Mix.

Then get yourself some aluminum foil and cover your pans bottom with a few layers until about half way.
  
Then pour in your beutiful cheesecake filling inside the pan. 

Shake it a tiny bit to fall into place. 

Now get your sheet pan and place the cheesecake in it.

Then boil a bunch of water and cover the springform pan until about half way. 

While the water is still hot place the whole thing into a preheated 160 degree celcius oven for 1 and a half hours to the bottom rack of your oven, until its still jiggly and a little bit browned inside. 

Now once the CAKE is done open the oven and let it cool in the oven for 45 minutes, that way you don't get any cracks. 

After that let the cake cool on a wire rack with tinfoil removed until its room temp. 
Then Cover it with plastic wrap and set it in a fridge to cool overnight or even more. 
Then your cake is done. 

Remove it from the fridge, open the springform pan and slice this magnificent cake of cheese.

*INGREDIENTS FOR 12-16 BARS*

Base layer:

\- Graham wafer crumbs or, alternatively, digestive biscuits \[1.75 cups / 180 g\]

\- coconut flakes \[1 cup / 75 g\]

\- finely chopped almonds \[1/2 cup / 50 g\]

\- unsalted butter \[1/2 cup / 110 g\]

\- fine/caster sugar \[1/4 cup / 45 g\]

\- cocoa powder \[5 tbsp / 30 g\]

\- 1 fresh egg

Custard icing layer:

\- unsalted butter \[1/2 cup / 110 g\]

\- heavy cream \[3 tbsp / 50 ml\]

\- Bird's custard powder \[2 tbsp / 25 g\]

\- icing sugar \[2 cups / 200 g\]

Coating:

\- unsalted butter \[2 tbsp / 30 g\]

\- semi-sweet chocolate \[4 oz / 120 g\]

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. For the 1st layer: Pulverize crackers, if you can't find Graham wafer crumbs, and - in a big enough bowl - mix those with the finely shredded coconut flakes as well as almonds and set aside
2. Melt butter in a double boiler (""bain-marie""). Whisk in sugar and cacao till well combined, before adding a beaten egg.  When adding the egg, make sure that you're simultaneously whisking the mass, in order for the egg to be incorporated fast. Otherwise you'll end up with junks of scrambled eggs. Continue whisking for a few minutes, till all ingredients unite and the mass thickens
3. Combine ingredients from steps 1 &amp; 2 and distribute over your 8x8 inch / 20x20 cm form. Evenly spread and press it with your spatula to a firm mass, leaving no space in between
4. For the 2nd layer: In a clean bowl, drop the warm butter, and unite it with the cream, custard powder and icing sugar. Once you get an even mass, you gotta grab your whisk and fluff it up! This took me 10-15 minutes, but if you have a proper electric whisk, you'll get there sooner 
5. Now spread that custard icing over the 1st layer of almond-coco-cracker
6. For the 3rd layer, combine the butter an chocolate in the double boiler till fully emulsified, which shouldn't take too long
7. Before pouring it over the 2nd layer, let cool down a bit, till not hot anymore, but still liquid. Evenly spread the chocolate, but be very careful and don't press it into the custard layer. I elevated the form and changed the angle and let the chocolate run all over. It worked out alright
8. Cover the form with plastic wrap and let chill in your fridge for at least 3 hours, before serving! I noticed that it tasted better, when kept in fridge overnight
9. Enjoy!

Difficulty Level - Intermediate

​

TIPS:  
\- If your dough is too soft to be worked with at any point, place it in the freeze for \~10 minutes before continuing, this helps to set it, although you must work quickly as it becomes soft very fast. 

  
\- Oranges contain natural pectin, if you don't have pectin I suggest to use the peels of the oranges themselves (look up how on the internet). However pectin makes the it really easy to make any sort of jams, so i highly recommend to buy it from the store.

  
\- You can make dehydrated/candied Orange slices by placing slices into the oven for around 2-4 hours at around 100°C. Lovely for decoration.

  
\- You can definitely use a normal baking pan for this recipe. However, the perforated ring helps to make it look super professional. If you plan on using a normal baking pan, I suggest the blind bake method

**Ingredients:**

160 g Pitted Dates

120 ml Hot Tea

1 cup Whole Wheat flour

1 cup All -Purpose Flour

2 tsp baking powder

1/2 tsp sea salt

3/4 cups cold unsalted butter

1 egg

2 tsp vanilla extract

1/2 cup almond milk

1 egg

Powdered Monk Fruit Sweetener for topping (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

**Recipe:**

Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit 

Chop or grind dates and pour hot tea over them. Let them sit for 5 minutes.

Sift flours, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Rub the butter quickly and lightly into flour with fingers until the consistency of bread crumbs. 

Drain dates  and discard the liquid. Mix in dates using fingers

Beat egg, vanilla and almond milk together in a small town. Gradually pour egg mixture into the flour mixture a bit at  time. Dough should be wet and sticky but still hold form. Set aside extra egg mixture. 

Dust contour with flour and flatten dough using hands into a rectangle about 2.5cm/1in thick and 6cm/2.5in wide. 

For American-style scones, cut the dough in quarters, and then on a reverse diagonal, cut into eights. Pick up each one, and quickly dust each side so scone is completely dusted. 

Put scones on baking sheet spaced at least 2.5cm/1in apart, as thy will spread when baked. Quickly brush the scones with the remaining egg mixture. 

Bake 14-20 minutes in the preheated open until rise and golden. Dust with powdered monk fruit sweetener with a sifter or eat as is or with butter. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think they turned out good. Tho, I would put less dates in it if I make date scones again. Maybe 100 grams instead.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/put6j1/date_scones_no_sugar/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/put6j1/date_scones_no_sugar/
pujffo,Blackcurrant Bakewell Tart,82,7,1632489008.0,1.0,Dessert,markandana_pantree,https://i.redd.it/o6ed09j59gp71.png,"Bakewell Tarts aren't traditionally made with blackcurrant jam, but we found it works *so* well because the jam has such a zing to it. Obviously the pastry could be shop-bought to simplify things if wanted!

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients**  
*For the pastry:*  
\- 300g plain white flour  
\- 30g white sugar  
\- 1/2 teaspoon fine salt  
\- 200g cold unsalted butter  
\- 1 egg yolk  
\- 3 tablespoons cold water (the colder, the better)  


*For the filling:*  
\- 1 jar blissfully blackcurrant jam  
\- 130g ground almonds  
\- 30g plain white flour  
\- 100g caster sugar  
\- 110g unsalted butter at room temperature  
\- 2 eggs  
\- 1 teaspoon almond extract  
   
  
**Method**  
  
1. For the pastry, start by adding the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor. Cut the cold butter (it needs to be cold and firm) into medium cubes (approximately 1x1 inch) and distrbute the cubes on top of the dry ingredients. Pulse 16 times.  
  
2. Turn off the food processor, add the egg yolk and turn it back on its lowest setting. While it is running, add 2-3 tablespoons of water and process for up to 10 seconds, just enough to combine. The pastry should still be quite crumbly after these steps.  
  
3. Turn the pastry onto a flat clean surface and, working it as little as possible, form it into a ball. Cover it tightly and put it in the fridge for 1 hour.  
  
4. Pre-heat the oven to 180C/160C Fan. Once the pastry has cooled, dust a flat surface with flour and roll out the dough medium-thin, or to the thickness of your liking, into a circle. Roll it up in a rolling pin and unfold it on a tart case. Use excess trimmings to fill up any gaps or holes (tip: use a small piece of dough as a tool to press the pastry against the case, ensuring it is well fit). Leave the overhangings for now, i.e. do not trim the edges, but do save a bit of dough in case you need to fill any holes later.   
  
5. Using a fork, make several holes throughout the bottom of the pastry. Place a piece of greaseproof baking paper on top of the tart case and top it with baking beans, rice or any other grain to weigh it down. Bake for 15-20mins.  
  
6. Remove the case from the oven, remove the baking paper and beans and bake it for another 5 minutes. Remove it from the oven and, while the pastry is still hot, use a serrated knife to carefully go around the edges of the case and trim them. Leave your knife as flat as possible for a smooth cut. Trimming the pastry at this stage rather than earlier reduces shrinkage.  
  
7. Set the pastry aside. For the filling, beat together the butter and sugar using an electric mixer for approximately 5 minutes, until light and fluffy.  
  
8. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well in between, and finally add the almond extract, beating once again to incorporate.  
  
9. Delicately fold in the ground almonds and flour, just until combined. Do not overmix or use an electric mixer for this stage.  
  
10. Line the tart case with a full jar of Blissfully Blackcurrant Jam, and delicately add the frangipane filling on top, using the back of a spoon to carefully spread it throughout the tart.  
  
11. Bake for 35-40mins until the frangipane has set. Let the tart cool fully before removing it from the case. Serve with creme fraiche, and be happy.

prsueh,Tiramisu Cheesecake,1668,26,1632137108.0,0.99,Dessert,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/47rxqhtw7no71.jpg,"The combination of these two delicious desserts is sinful and sexy. Each spoonful asks for another and when everything is gone you look for more, addiction? Very likely!

Preparation is simple but it takes a little bit of waiting for the layers to set. Everything that takes time tastes a lot better and we are here for the quality of flavour! Enjoy cooking friends!

**The Biscuit Base**

For the base layer of the Tiramisu Cheesecake, you can use any type of digestive biscuits. I choose one cover with chocolate to add another layer of love to the recipe.

Be very careful not to add too much butter to the base as this will solidify it too much and you will not be able to dig in. We finish this layer with a nice shot of espresso but you can try different things to your liking.

**Chocolate Middle**

This layer is basically thick chocolate ganache with the liquor, you can skip alcohol completely and substitute it with almond extract or other baking aromas.

**Cheesecake Topping**

For this creamy layer, I like to use full-fat Philadelphia cheese, you can opt for a lighter version and lower the amount of sugar by half but why would you do this? It is a sin worthy dessert! I always recommend vanilla bean paste over the extract but use what's in your cupboard and it will still taste superb. You can also add any type of citrus zest that you like to create another layer of freshness in this dessert.

**Garnish**

If you go for simplicity and a more classical look cocoa powder is just fine. To elevate more use crushed dark chocolate or super tasty chocolate espresso beans.

**Ingredients for base:**

150g (5.3oz) of chocolate digestive biscuits

30g (1oz) of melted butter

3tsp of strong espresso

**Ingredients for chocolate layer:**

250g (8.8oz) of milk chocolate (drops or finely chopped)

150ml of double cream

100ml of coffee flavoured liquor like Tia Maria or Kahlua

**Ingredients for the cheesecake layer:**

150g (5.3oz) of cream cheese

100ml of double cream

1tsp vanilla bean paste

50g (1.7oz) of icing sugar

cocoa powder for garnish

**Instructions:**

For this recipe, you will need 5 dessert jars or glass bowls.

1. Crush chocolate digestive biscuits in a bag with a rolling pin then transfer to a bowl, combine with melted butter and 3tsp of strong espresso. With a help of a spoon transfer to glass bowls/jars and create a flat bottom layer then place in the fridge.
2. For the chocolate layer, place a bowl over a pan of simmering water and add the double cream, chocolate drops and liquor. Once chocolate melts, gently stir with a spatula until combined and pour into the jars. Place back in the fridge to set for 3-4h.

Tip: When cooking over simmering water (Bain-Marie): Make sure that the bowl doesn't touch the water, you want the steam to transfer the heat and do the cooking.

3. Once the chocolate layer is set you can proceed with the cheesecake, to do so use a hand or standing mixer. Beat the cream cheese to soften up then add vanilla bean paste, icing sugar and double cream. Whisk until stiff peaks then transfer to jars. Dust with cocoa powder and place back in the fridge for a couple of hours.

4. You can keep Tiramisu Cheesecake in the fridge for up to 3 days. Enjoy!

- 4.5 tbsp unsalted softened butter  
- 1/2 cup and 2 tbsp all-purpose flour  
- 2 tsp ube extract  
Water Dough  
- 3/4 cup and 1 tbsp all-purpose flour  
- 1 tbsp granulated sugar  
- 3 tbsp unsalted softened butter  
- 1/4 cup water  
   
INSTRUCTIONS  
Ube Paste  
1. In a large bowl, mix together the steamed and grated ube along with the sugar, butter, and water until well combined  
2. Pour the mixture onto a pan on medium-high heat and cook until the paste forms and clings to itself, away from the pan  
3. Transfer the ube paste to a heatproof bowl and cover with plastic wrap so that the plastic wrap touches the surface of the ube paste  
4. Refrigerate until cool  
5. Once cooled, divide the ube paste into 12 equal-sized balls  

Mochi  
1. In a microwave-safe bowl combine the glutinous rice flour, sugar, cornstarch, water, and oil until well combined  
2. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 2 minutes  
3. Remove from the microwave and stir the mochi around  
4. Cover the bowl again and microwave for another 2 minutes  
5. Remove from the microwave and stir the mochi around  
6. Cover the bowl again and microwave for a final 30 seconds  
7. Remove from the microwave and give it one final stir before covering with plastic wrap (so that the film touches the top of the mochi) and allow to completely cool  
8. Once cooled, divide the mochi into 12 equal-sized balls  

Mooncake Pastry  
1. For the water dough, in a large bowl combine the flour, sugar, water, and softened butter  
2. Gently knead the dough until it forms and comes together (does not necessarily need to be smooth or pass the windowpane test at this point)  
3. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and allow to sit for 30 minutes  
4. For the oil dough, in a small bowl combine the flour, butter, and ube extract  
5. Knead the dough until it forms together and then wrap it with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to sit for 20 minutes  
6. Once both of the dough have rested, divide each of them into 6 equal-sized balls  
7. Take a white, water dough ball and flatten it out into a circle. Fully encase this dough around the purple oil dough ball  
8. Repeat this step for all the dough balls  
9. Take one of the encased balls and, with the seam side down, roll out the dough into a long strip  
10. Take the edge with the least amount of white dough and start to roll up the dough from one end to the other until you have a log  
11. Repeat the above two steps with the rest of the dough balls  
12. Then take the dough log, and placing it down vertically with the seam side down, roll it out into a long thin rectangle  
13. Once again roll up the dough into a log and cut it in half  
14. Repeat the above two steps with the rest of the dough logs  
Note: Throughout this entire process ensure that the dough is always covered with plastic wrap once done using it!  

Assembly  
1. Preheat the oven to 340F  
2. Take a ball of ube paste and wrap it around a cooled ball of mochi  
3. Repeat this until you have 12 evenly sized ube mochi balls  
4. Take a halved log of the mooncake pastry and, with the cut side down, carefully roll it out into a circle  
5. Place the ball of ube mochi into the center and wrap the pastry around that (it's important to ensure that the previously cut side of the dough is the side that is on the outside of the mooncake once the ube mochi ball has been wrapped)  
6. Repeat the above two steps for the rest of the ube mochi balls  
7. Place the mooncakes on a lined baking sheet and bake for 20-22 minutes

Recipe VIDEO [https://youtu.be/SIBaCWpIvEQ](https://youtu.be/SIBaCWpIvEQ)

RECIPE 

* 150 ml heavy cream
* 370 ml whole milk
* 6.25 oz (177 g) khoya/mawa (solid milk)
* 4 slices of sandwich bread (not stale bread)
* 1/3 cup mix of almond and cashew
* 2 tablespoons raisins (Soaking in water for some time will help to plump it up)
* 6 green cardamoms
* 3 tablespoons sugar  


1. Grate the khoya to a non-stick skillet, sprinkle 1 and ½ tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons milk and give it mix. Stir it around for 10 minutes in medium heat. It will soften down and then comes together like a dough without sticking to the pan.
2. Take it off once done and keep it aside to be used later.
3. To the same skillet, pour the milk and the heavy cream along with rest of the sugar, crushed cardamoms and give a mix. Let it simmer in medium heat for 10 minutes.
4. Then add 1/3rd of the khoya mixture to the skillet and stir around to incorporate the khoya to the milk. It will make it creamier. Simmer for 5 minutes.
5. Add some of the chopped nuts and soaked raisins, give a mix and keep it aside to cool down a little bit. The malai milk is ready.
6. In the meantime, slice the sides off the breads. And roll it gently to thin it out.
7. If the khoya mixture looks dry, add couple tablespoons of the flavored milk to soften the texture. Spread 1 and ½ tablespoons of the khoya mixture on one end of the bread, and dab water at the other end of the bread. Roll it firmly and press a little to seal it tight. Then slice in half using a bread knife 
8. Layer the bread roll seam side down on a serving platter.
9. The malai milk should be little hot when you pour it on the bread roll. So, if it feels cold, just warm it up and then pour it on the bread roll. Scatter rest of the chopped nuts and soaked raisins on top and enjoy it.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/plbmd4/bread_roll_malai/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/plbmd4/bread_roll_malai/

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C
2. Start with the cake batter: In a big enough bowl, whisk eggs, sugar, apricot jam and warm butter till well combined
3. Mix in the milk and vinegar (we used apple sider, but any vinegar works. It's less about the taste, but rather vinegar acting as a raising agent when combined with baking soda)
4. Combine the flour, baking soda, as well as salt in a separate bowl and gradually sift it into the batter and whisk well
5. Grease an oven safe form \[approx. 8x8 inches / 20x20 cm\], transfer the batter into it and spread it evenly
6. Bake for 30-40 minutes in the middle of your oven, till fully cooked (you can perform the usual wooden toothpick test)
7. While cooking prepare the sauce: In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the sugar, butter, heavy cream and vanilla essence. Mix till butter is fully melted and sugar dissolved, bring to a slight boil, take off the heat, put on a lid and set aside, till cake finishes baking
8. When the cake is done, take it out of the oven and pour the sauce over the cake. The sauce will be fully absorbed by the cake within minutes
9. Let it rest for 10 minutes and serve it warm. Vanilla ice cream and custard go very well with it

* 1 cup of Sugar

* 2 eggs

* 2 tablespoons of Honey

* 2 tablespoons of Butter

* 1 teaspoon of Baking Soda

* 3 cups of Flour

* 1 1/2 cups of Heavy Cream

* 1 1/2 cups of Sour Cream 

* 2-3 tablespoons of Honey 

**Directions**

1. In a saucepan, add the sugar, eggs, honey, and butter. 

2. Mix well, then turn on the fire. Cook this until the sugar dissolves, do not stop mixing so because it burns quickly.

3. Once the sugar has melted add the baking soda, you will notice that it will bubble up keep mixing this for 1 minute then turn off the fire.

4. Add the flour and mix as much as you can.

5. Transfer to a surface so you can continue mixing by hand, be careful it might still be very hot. But it's best to work with dough while warm

6. Once your dough has come together you can weigh it and cut it into 6 to 8 equal pieces. (check tips below to get more ideas) 

7. Roll and flatten each dough piece and cut to the desired shape. Do not throw away the extras, bake them we will use them to decorate.

8. Bake these for around 10 to 15 minutes (maybe a little more), they should be dark golden brown.

9. Once they come out of the oven if your baking sheet isn't flat make sure to move your cookies to somewhere flat (like the countertop or table), because once they cool they will harden and you want a straight cake.

10. The extra pieces that you baked, once cooled place in the food processor until powder-like.

Sour Cream Frosting:
Whip the heavy cream, sour cream, and honey until well mixed (that's it 😂)

**Strawberry marinade**  
\- Chop strawberries into small dice. Add 3 tbsp of sugar and the juice from a half lime, mix well.  
\- Place this marinade in the fridge while preparing other ingredients.

**Cake base**  
\- Add 5 eggs and 1 cup of sugar to a clean bowl, place the bowl over simmering water.  
\- Whisk well until the mixture is slightly warmer than your fingers. Remove the bowl from the warm water bath and keep whisking at room temperature, until it reaches the ribbon stage.  
\- Sift 1 cup of cake flour in, and gently mix well.  
\- Prepare a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Transfer the mixture to the baking sheet and gently cover it evenly.  
\- Bake the cake at 400F for 10-12 minutes.  
\- When the cake is cooled down, cut into 3 circles (the size is based on the bowl that you are using for assembling later, see the video for more detail.)

**Custard cream**  
\- In a saucepan, add 2 and a half cups of milk, and a few drops of the vanilla extract. Simmer the milk over low heat.  
\- In a bowl, combine 4 yolks and 4 tbsp of sugar.

\- Place some plastic wrap in the bowl, so that the cake can be easily removed later  
\- Place the strawberry slices alongside the bowl. Add custard cream over it.  
\- Place the smallest cake circle in, add the marinade strawberry, and then cover with the cream.  Place another circle, marinade strawberry, and cream. At the end cover it up with the biggest cake circle.  
\- Cover the bowl with a plastic film and fridge it for at least 4 hours. So that the cake can keep its shape.  
\- 4 hours later, place a plate on the top and flip it, remove the bowl and the plastic film. And the cake is done. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/oxdqzj/strawberry_custard_cake/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/oxdqzj/strawberry_custard_cake/

Usually I like to whip my own (whip a cup of heavy cream with 2 tbsp sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. When soft peaks form, add a shot of Bailey’s and whip a few seconds longer for Bailey’s whipped cream) but after I shaved down a chocolate bar, I wasn’t feeling like the extra step so I used canned whipped cream. *One thing I have noticed about canned vs. fresh is that the canned stuff melts very quickly into the drink whereas fresh whipped cream will hold throughout the drink so you'll still have some left to slurp up at the end.

If you can get your hands on fresh strawberries, you must grab your whisk and make some of this delicious, perfect summer dessert!

**Enjoy the recipe and** [**our United Cuisines show on YouTube!**](https://youtu.be/L3TqgSEt9gI)

*INGREDIENTS:*

\- fresh strawberries \[0.9 lbs / 400 g\]

\- whipping cream \[1.25 cups / 300 ml\]

\- meringue \[1.1 oz / 32 g\]

\- vanilla extract \[0.5 tsp / 2 ml\]

Servings: 3

*INSTRUCTIONS:*

1. Wash the strawberries and cut into quarters. Remove pedicel and leaf cap except on three strawberries, which you can use for decorative purposes
2. Whip the cream, which probably is the one and only challenge in this recipe! Cool down your whisk and bowl in the fridge, which can make difference, esp. on hot summer days. The cream must be cold, too. We not only stored it in the fridge, but put in into the freezer for 30 minutes before whipping it
3. Perform stiffness test on your whipped cream: it should double in volume and remain in the bowl, when turned upside down shortly
4. Mix in vanilla extract into the cream
5. Assemble the Eton Mess by adding half of the whipped cream to the strawberries and break up the meringue into bite-size pieces and spread on top. Gently mix/fold everything and repeat the step with remaining cream and meringue
6. Transfer into your favorite serving vehicle and enjoy ASAP, otherwise the crunchy meringue will turn soft

**Note:** We did not add any sugar, for the meringue is extremely sweet already, and our ripe strawberries were great without any additional sugar.

This easy dorayaki recipe makes fluffy, soft castella pancakes and a lightly sweetened filling!  Dorayaki is a popular Japanese confectionary, and its most common variety is honey flavored castella cakes with red bean paste. 

Have you already made this type of dorayaki before? I also included a pretty comprehensive list of others flavors/fillings that you can experiment with!

[Full recipe](https://www.assortedeats.com/homemade-dorayaki/) with other flavors/fillings and more info!

Ingredients

* 4 eggs
* 100 g sugar, 1/2 cup
* 63 g honey, 3 tbsp
* 160 g all-purpose flour, 1 1/3 cup
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 2 tbsp water
* red bean paste

Instructions

1. In a large bowl, add the eggs, sugar, and honey. Whisk well until the sugar has dissolved. The eggs do not need to be fluffy.
2. Sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl. Gently whisk the ingredients together until the batter is smooth.
3. Cover and refrigerate the bowl for 15-20 minutes. Five minutes before the dorayaki pancake batter is done chilling, preheat a nonstick pan over medium-low heat.
4. Take the dorayaki batter out of the refrigerator and stir in the water. You may need to add more or less water depending on your eggs and flour measurement. 
5. Pour in a small amount of oil into the nonstick pan and use a paper towel to spread the oil into a thin layer and wipe off excess oil.
6. Add 2 tbsp of the batter into the pan. Cook for about 2 minutes until the bubbles start appearing and popping on the surface of the pancakes. Then, flip the pancakes over and cook for roughly one more minute. 
7. Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and cover them with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out and getting tough. Repeat with the remaining batter.
8. Spread a heaping tablespoon or two of red bean paste onto one pancake, keeping the center thicker. Add another pancake on top and pinch the edge of the pancakes together to create one sandwich. Repeat with the remaining pancakes.
9. Store pancakes in an airtight container for up to 2-3 days.

**Ingredients:**

\- 3 organic egg yolks

\- 2tbsp of caster sugar

\- 2tbsp of whisky (you can also use Marsala or Cognac)

\- 75ml of double or whipping cream

\- few strawberries

\- few blueberries

\- chocolate wafer (optional)

**Instructions:**

1.In the metal bowl, mix 3 egg yolks with 2tbsp caster sugar until sugar dissolves.

2.Add 2tbsp of whisky and combine (You can also use Marsala or Cognac)

3.Whisk Zabaione over the Bain-marie for around 2 minutes, you can control the temperature by lifting the bowl (Be careful not to burn yourself, if the water is boiling to rapidly lower the stove temperature)

4.Once Zabaione turns pale yellow and consistency seems thick but still runny remove from the heat.

5.In the separate bowl whisk 75ml of double or whipping cream.

6.Gently fold in the whipped cream into the Zabaione (Do not mix or whisk)

7.Transfer to the champagne glass, add summer fruits and enjoy this beautiful dessert!

&amp;#x200B;

**Insight:**

\- Egg yolk thickens at the temperature of 65C (149F) and sets at 70C (158F) while egg whites need 80C (176F) to coagulate.

\- By gently folding cream you preserve the air bubbles that were created during the whipping. Mixing, whisking and overfolding destroy this fragile structure.

\- Double and whipping cream foams thanks to the high amount of fat (30%-48%)

**Ingredients** (for 4 cakesicles)  
\- 120g of cake (pound cake/chocolate cake/or any types of cake will work for this recipe)  
\- 1 tsp of heavy cream  
\- Melted Chocolate (1 tsp for the cake dough, 1/2 cup for coating the cakesicles)  
\- Strawberry slices \* 4  
\- 2 tbsp of sugar pearl sprinkles

**Material needed**  
\- Popsicle mold

Video tutorial: [https://youtu.be/4EzSX-BuWG0](https://youtu.be/4EzSX-BuWG0)

**Directions**

1. Break up the cake, add heavy cream and melted chocolate into the cake, it will make it stick together like dough.   
\*\* The ratio of the cream/melted chocolate to the cake is not fixed. I usually add a small amount at a time and roll it together, until it feels wet like a dough, and can be easily stuck together.
2. Melt the white chocolate, then fill the popsicle mold with it. Rotate the mold to spread the chocolate evenly, until it is covered all over the mold. Use a spatula to remove the excess chocolate.
3. Place strawberry slices on the mold, and then insert the popsicle sticks while the chocolate is still warm. 
4. Place the mold in the freezer for 5 minutes. Once take out again, add the second layer of chocolate to make sure the mold is fully covered. Freeze for another 5 minutes.
5. Add the cake dough in and gently press it to make sure it fills in all the gaps inside the mold.
6. Cover more melted chocolate on the top. Use a spatula to spread the chocolate evenly and then remove the excess.
7. Freeze for 5 minutes and it will be very easy to push the cakesicles out of the mold.  
\*\* If there is chocolate cover the strawberry slices, it would be a very thin layer and can be easily removed with a folk.
8. To decorate the cakesicles, add warm chocolate to a piping bag and fill around the edge between strawberry and chocolate. Add sprinkles on the top. The warm chocolate will work like glue and make the sprinkles stick to the cakesicle when it cools down.

3.) Place a large knob of butter in a frying pan, enough to coat the surface. Set the pan to medium heat and allow butter to melt and heat up before adding the cinnamon stick and sliced nectarines, skin side up. Let the face of the fruits caramelise and take on some colour for about 2 minutes. Mind that your butter does not darken too much, turning the heat down if necessary.

4.) Grate fresh nutmeg over the nectaries. Turn them over and add the brown sugar and water mixture into the pan. If the sugar hardens add a little more water into the pan. Spoon the mixture over the top and cook the nectarines down, turning as necessary until they are soft all the way through while still holding their shape.

5.) Serve the nectarines with freshly torn mint leaves , a pinch of cinnamon and a generous dollop of mascarpone to top. Add a scattering of crushed pistachios, salted are nice.

1532z32,Summer Tomato Pasta with Sausage and Zucchini,450,19,1689697338.0,0.99,Pasta,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/knfx33qm1rcb1.jpg,"Grating tomatoes is one of the BEST ways to use up those over-ripe tomatoes. I love it because it's no-mess...you don't have to dice them or blanch them and you won't have skins in the sauce.

You just grate on the large holes of a box grater and you can whizz through a bunch of tomatoes in like 5 mins. You want to use juicy, super ripe tomatoes...avoid Roma tomatoes as they are too dry/firm.

I use this process for homemade salsa because honestly, i just hate chopping up tomatoes (I have slight eczema on my fingers and the acidity of tomatoes really effs up my fingers) so grating is a really nice way to prep them for me!

Just be mindful that there's a LOT of water in the grated tomatoes so you want to cook it off. I don't like straining them because I like cooking down the liquid; I think it makes a more flavorful sauce.

**Ingredients:**

* 1½ pounds large, ripe tomatoes (or use 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes)
* 1 pound hot Italian sausage
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2 small zucchini, trimmed and diced
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* Pinch of sugar optional
* 16 ounces rigatoni
* 5 ounces baby spinach
* 1 lemon, juiced
* ½ cup Parmesan, finely grated; a pinch reserved for garnish
* Salt and pepper

**Prep the tomatoes:**

1. Cut off a very thin slice from the bottom of the tomatoes.
2. Grate the tomatoes into a large bowl using the large holes of a box grater. Discard the skins.

**Cook the sausage:**

1. Heat a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the sausage and cook, breaking it up periodically, for 12–15 minutes until cooked through. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and drain off all but a teaspoon of the oil in the pot.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the onion. Cook for 5–7 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and zucchini and fry for 1–2 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper to taste.
2. Return the sausage to the pot and pour in the grated tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20–30 minutes or until the sauce is thick. Stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from sticking. The grated tomatoes make quite a bit of excess water, so you want to cook it all off!  Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Boil the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add a generous amount of salt and the rigatoni. Cook until 1-2 minutes under al dente. Scoop out 1/2 cup pasta water and drain the pasta.

**Finish the pasta:**

1. Taste the sauce and season once more. Add the baby spinach, lemon juice, and cooked pasta. Toss to coat for 2–3 minutes until the spinach is wilted. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and toss to coat for 1 minute more. Add pasta water if needed to loosen up the sauce and coat the pasta. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls. Sprinkle more Parmesan on each plate. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1532z32/summer_tomato_pasta_with_sausage_and_zucchini/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1532z32/summer_tomato_pasta_with_sausage_and_zucchini/

* ½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, divided
* 12–15 basil leaves, a few reserved for garnish
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions**

**Prepare the citrus salt:**

1. Zest the lemon and transfer the zest to a bowl. Juice the lemon into a separate bowl and set aside. Add the flaky sea salt to the lemon zest and mix to combine. Set aside for garnish.

**Start the sauce:**

1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, for 7–8 minutes. Add the shallot and cook an additional 8–10 minutes or until the chicken is completely cooked through and the onion is softened. Season liberally with salt and pepper.

**Simmer the sauce:**

1. Create a well in the middle of the pot and melt the butter. Once bubbly, add the Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper to the butter and stir to combine until fragrant. Toss to coat the chicken with the butter and seasonings. Taste and add more salt, pepper, or crushed red pepper to taste.
2. Add the cherry tomatoes and turn the heat to high. Once the skins begin to split, pour in the water or chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. The liquid should reduce by half. Taste and season.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a generous amount of salt and cook the rigatoni according to package instructions. Scoop out ½ cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the pasta. Set aside.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Pour the heavy cream and half the pasta cooking water into the sauce. Bring to a boil and add all but 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan cheese. Stir often to melt the cheese into the sauce.
2. Reduce heat to low and add the cooked pasta and toss to combine. Cook for 1–2 minutes to coat the pasta with the sauce, adding more pasta cooking water if needed. Finish the sauce by adding the basil and lemon juice. Cook for 1 minute more. Then, turn off the heat and season once more to your preferences.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the pasta into bowls and serve with the remaining Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of citrus salt on each bowl. Garnish with a few additional basil leaves on top if you like. Enjoy!

Transfer to a plate.

**Start the sauce:**

1. To the pot of rendered chicken fat, add the diced shallots and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook for 3–5 minutes or until the shallots soften.
2. Add the minced garlic and crushed red pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 1 minute until fragrant.
3. Pour in the balsamic vinegar and bring to a boil.
4. Add the canned tomatoes and season all over with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then turn off the heat. Using a potato masher, gently mash the tomatoes. Add the parmesan rind and a pinch of sugar.

**Bake the chicken and sauce:**

1. Arrange the chicken on top of the sauce, skin-side up, and transfer to the oven for 20 minutes. If using bone-in thighs, increase cooking time to 30–35 minutes. Once the internal temperature reaches 165ºF, remove the pot from the oven and turn on the broiler.

**Cook the spaghetti:**

1. While the chicken bakes, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and cook the spaghetti until al dente. Remove 1/3 cup of the pasta cooking water and set aside. Drain the pasta.

**Prepare the fried basil panko:**

1. In a small pot, heat 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the chopped basil leaves and stir constantly for 1 minute until fragrant.
2. Add the panko and stir to incorporate. Cook until the panko deepens in color and toasts. Turn off the heat. Let stand for 5–10 minutes.
3. Stir the grated parmesan into the panko. Add a sprinkle of salt. Set aside.

**Finish the chicken:**

1. Remove the parmesan rind from the sauce and discard it. Sprinkle a bit of mozzarella on top of each piece of chicken. Drizzle the mozzarella with a touch of extra virgin olive oil, if you like. Transfer the pot back to the oven under the broiler, and broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Turn off the broiler and remove the pot from the oven. Scatter a bit of the basil panko on top of the chicken and transfer the chicken to a serving platter. Don’t worry if some of the panko ends up in the sauce!

**Sauce the pasta:**

1. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce. Add the pasta cooking water, as needed, and toss to coat the pasta with the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls and serve with a chicken thigh on top. Spoon more fried basil panko on top and garnish with fresh basil.

* ½ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for serving
* A few fresh basil leaves, optional, for garnish
* Extra virgin olive oil, optional, for serving
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Cook the sausages:**

1. Drizzle 1 teaspoon of oil in a wide pot. Turn the heat to medium-high. Once hot, add the sausages and cook without moving for 3–5 minutes until golden brown. Flip and cook for 3–5 minutes until the other side is golden brown. Transfer to a plate.

**Sauté the onion:**

1. If needed, add another drizzle of oil. Add the yellow onion and cook, occasionally turning, for 6–7 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon butter and a pinch of sugar. Continue cooking the onion until it takes on a light golden brown color for 5–7 minutes.

* Salt
* 5 tbsp Vegetable Oil

&amp;#x200B;

3. Make sure to drain the sauerkraut well after cooking it to prevent the dish from becoming too watery.
4. You can use any type of smoked sausage, such as kielbasa, for this recipe. If you prefer, you can also use another type of sausage or omit it altogether for a vegetarian version.
5. Don’t overcrowd the pan when cooking the vegetables, as this can cause them to become soggy instead of getting nicely caramelized.
6. You can adjust the amount of oil you use in the recipe to your liking. You can also substitute the vegetable oil with another type of oil, such as olive oil.
7. This dish can be served hot or cold, so it’s a great option for leftovers or meal prep.

10kdstm,Skillet Lasagna Recipe,1390,27,1674588462.0,0.99,Pasta,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/9cuz9wmml1ea1.jpg,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Skillet Lasagna Recipe**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/skillet-lasagna-recipe/)

I should preface this by saying that this recipe was kind of an accident. I wanted to make skillet lasagna but didn't realize that that was a class of recipes that mostly involved chopping up some cooked pasta, tossing it with sauce, and finishing with cheese. instead, this is literally lasagna in a skillet.

I do like that if you use no-boil pasta sheets, everything can be done in one skillet (I used an 11-inch skillet), and I like that it gives ya a bigger ratio of crispy pasta edges than with baking-tray lasagna. I will definitely be making this kind of lasagna again in the future! If you have questions about how I layered it, let me know. It was kind of hard to explain in the recipe instructions! I do have progress pics of the lasagna if anyone want to see how it came together!!

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 1 hour 10 minutes

Inactive time: 40 minutes

Total Time: 2 hours 5 minutes

Servings: 8

Calories: 477kcal per slice

**Ingredients**

**Sauce:**

* 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 pound ground beef
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
* ½ teaspoon onion powder
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* 24 ounces jar of your favorite tomato sauce
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Spinach-ricotta filling:
* 5 ounces baby spinach
* ¼ cup water
* 16 ounces ricotta
* 1 egg
* ½ cup grated mozzarella cheese
* ¼ cup grated Parmigiano-reggiano
* ½ lemon, juiced
* 2 tablespoons fresh basil, finely chopped
* 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For assembly:**

* 12 ounces lasagna sheets
* 1½ cups grated mozzarella
* Extra virgin olive oil

**For serving:**

* Fresh basil leaves

**Instructions**

**Prepare the noodles:**

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil if you aren't using no-boil lasagna. Cook the lasagna sheets for exactly 5 minutes. If you aren't ready to assemble the lasagna immediately, rinse the lasagna sheets with cold water to prevent them from sticking. Transfer them in a stack to a cutting board and cut them in half crosswise.
2. If using no-boil lasagna sheets, soften them in water for 15 minutes. Then, cut in half crosswise and set aside.

**Prepare the spinach:**

1. In an 11-inch skillet, heat 1/4 cup water over medium heat until warm. Add the spinach and cook for 5 minutes, occasionally stirring, until it wilts. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and place the plate in the freezer for 10 minutes. Remove the spinach from the freezer and squeeze out all excess water. Roughly chop the spinach and set aside.
2. Wipe out the skillet and return it to the stovetop.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. In the same skillet, heat 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil. Add the beef and onion and cook, often stirring, for 10–15 minutes until the beef is browned and the onion softens. Drain off excess fat if needed. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, onion powder, and a generous sprinkle of crushed red pepper. Cook for 1–2 minutes.
2. Pour in the prepared sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20–30 minutes until thickened. Taste and season to your preferences.

**Prepare the spinach-ricotta filling:**

1. In a bowl, combine the ricotta, egg, mozzarella cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, lemon juice, fresh basil, and fresh parsley, and stir until the egg is completely incorporated into the cheese and the mixture is well-combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the reserved, chopped spinach and toss to combine. Set aside.

**Assemble the lasagna:**

1. Preheat oven to 350ºF.
2. Spoon out ¾ of the tomato sauce into a bowl. You should have enough left in the skillet to coat the bottom with a thin layer of sauce.
3. Divide the lasagna sheets into thirds. Arrange one-third of the lasagna squares in a circle, with the squares slightly overlapping each other. Place two squares in the center and ensure that the bottom of the skillet is covered with pasta.
4. Cover the pasta with half of the ricotta filling and smooth it into an even layer. Add a third of the reserved sauce and smooth it into an even layer over the cheese. Sprinkle with half the mozzarella cheese.
5. Add the second pile of lasagna sheets in the same pattern as the first, ensuring the squares overlap and placing two squares in the center. Add half of the remaining pasta sauce and the remaining ricotta filling and smooth into an even layer. Arrange all of the remaining pasta sheets on top and smooth the remaining pasta sauce on top. Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese. Drizzle the top of the lasagna with 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil.

**Bake the lasagna:**

1. Cover the skillet with foil and transfer to the oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and broil for 3–5 minutes to brown the top of the cheese.
2. Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes.

**To serve:**

1. Garnish the lasagna with fresh basil leaves. Cut into eight slices and enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10kdstm/skillet_lasagna_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10kdstm/skillet_lasagna_recipe/

* 1 large yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 8 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* ¼ cup tomato paste
* 1 28- ounce can crushed tomatoes
* 1 15- ounce can crushed tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* 4 sprigs basil
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Filling:**

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 16- ounce package fresh spinach or use 2 10-ounce packages frozen, thawed spinach
* 16 ounces ricotta cheese
* 8 ounces (2 cups) grated mozzarella cheese
* 2 eggs
* 8 basil leaves, minced
* ½ lemon, juiced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* 8-ounce package manicotti
* ½ cup grated mozzarella
* Fresh basil leaves, optional

**Instructions**

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 6–8 minutes. Add the butter to the pot. Once melted, add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
2. Add the tomato paste and mash it into the onion and garlic. Cook for 4–5 minutes until it deepens in color.
3. Add the crushed tomatoes, sugar, crushed red pepper, and basil sprigs. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low.
4. Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and continue simmering for at least 1 hour, uncovered, until the sauce is thick and jammy. Taste and season to your preferences, and discard the basil sprigs.

**Cook the spinach (optional):**

1. If using fresh spinach\*, heat 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet. Once hot, add the spinach and ¼ cup of water. Cook, turning regularly, until the spinach wilts completely. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
2. Place the spinach on a paper towel-lined plate in an even layer. Transfer to the freezer for 5–10 minutes. Once the spinach is cool enough to handle, squeeze out all of the excess moisture and then roughly chop. Set aside. 

**Prepare the cheese filling:**
1. Mix the ricotta, mozzarella, eggs, basil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper in a large bowl. Mix with a spoon until smooth.
2. Add the chopped spinach and stir until combined. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until needed.

**Cook the manicotti (optional):**

1. If parboiling the manicotti, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil first. Add the manicotti and cook for precisely 5 minutes. Drain and rinse until cold water. Set aside. *(See boiling notes below.)*

**Prepare the manicotti:**

1. Preheat oven to 350ºF.
2. Add half the pasta sauce to the bottom of a 9”x13” baking dish and smooth it into an even layer. Set aside.
3. Stuff the manicotti with the filling using a long spoon or a piping bag. Be sure each piece of pasta is fully stuffed, but be careful not to overstuff as it will split the pasta. Place the stuffed manicotti into the baking dish on top of the sauce. Continue on until all of the manicotti are stuffed.
4. Spoon 1–2 cups more sauce on top of the manicotti and smooth into an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup mozzarella on top of the manicotti. Cover the baking dish with foil and transfer it to the oven. Bake, covered, for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes.
5. Turn on the broiler and broil for 1–3 minutes until the cheese is browned and bubbly. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5–10 minutes.

**To serve:**

1. Scatter a few fresh basil leaves on top of the casserole. Serve the manicotti with any remaining pasta sauce. Enjoy!

**Notes:**

\*If using frozen, thawed spinach, skip sautéing and freezing the spinach. Simply chop it up and continue with the recipe as-is.

You don't have to boil the manicotti! Here are my suggestions depending on how you want to boil the pasta:

* **No boil:** Cover and bake the casserole for 55 minutes at 350ºF. Remove the cover, bake for 10 minutes more, and then broil for 1–3 minutes.
* **5 minute boil time:** Cover and bake the casserole for 40 minutes at 350ºF. Remove the cover, bake for 5 minutes more, and then broil for 1–3 minutes.
* **9 minute boil time\*:** Bake uncovered for 30 minutes at 400ºF. Broil for 1–3 minutes.

\*This is based off the recipe on the back of the Barilla box. It’s the shortest baking time which may be tempting, but these will be the most difficult to stuff. While you can make manicotti without boiling the noodles, I do recommend a 5 minute boil time for the shortest baking time.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10do3rp/spinach_and_cheese_manicotti_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10do3rp/spinach_and_cheese_manicotti_recipe/

1. Before the squash finishes roasting, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and the pasta. Cook until al dente. Scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water. Set it aside and then drain the pasta.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Remove the skillet from the oven. Transfer the garlic to a plate and let it cool. Remove and discard the thyme sprigs. Once the garlic is cool enough to handle, carefully pop the cloves out from the skin. Transfer the garlic to the skillet. Using a fork or potato masher, mash squash and garlic until mostly smooth. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
2. Add the pasta cooking water and cream to the skillet and stir until smooth. If needed, continue to thin out the sauce with more water, cream, or vegetable broth until the sauce reaches desired consistency. Bring to a low boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 10 minutes.

**Sauce the pasta:**

1. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat. Taste and season once more. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Finish the pasta with a splash of lemon juice if you like. Divide between bowls and finish with freshly minced parsley or chives, if you like.

it's kinda like rigatoni lasagna; very comforting and rich! I think pasta al forno may typically have pork, veal, or sausage in it...I made mine with mushrooms, but you can add whatever meat you want. just cook it first, then do the mushrooms, and so on...and add the cooked meat back with the tomatoes.

**Mushroom-tomato sauce:**

* 2 1/2 cups whole milk, warmed in the microwave for 1–2 minutes
* Pinch of white pepper
* Salt

**For assembly:**

* 16 ounces rigatoni
* 6 ounces grated mozzarella
* 4 ounces grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Fresh basil, for serving

**Prepare the mushroom-tomato sauce:**

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. heat neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add half the mushrooms and cook for 8–10 minutes until they turn golden brown and crisp up around the edges. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl. Add a bit more oil and the remaining mushrooms, and cook an additional 8–10 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of mushrooms.
3. Add the onion to the pot and cook for 5–6 minutes until it begins to soften. Return the mushrooms to the pot and add the garlic, dry thyme, and a big pinch of crushed red pepper.
4. Turn the heat to high, and as soon as the mushrooms begin sizzling hard in the pot (be careful not to burn them!), pour in the sweet vermouth. Stir to lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat and cook for 3–4 minutes.
5. Add the crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce to the pot and bring to a boil. Add a pinch of sugar if you like. Reduce heat and stir in the basil and parsley. Simmer, uncovered, for 30–40 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the pasta:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients**

Pumpkin Gnocchi

* 1 cup pumpkin puree (remove as much moisture)
* 1 medium russet potato
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 medium egg
* 1/2 tsp fine salt
* Cloves (used as the stem and not edible)

Asian-Inspired Butter Sauce

* ¼ cup  unsalted butter
* 1 1/2 tablespoons Sesame Oil
* 1 tablespoon Soy Sauce
* 1 teaspoon garlic, minced
* 1/4 teaspoon ginger, grated

**Instructions**

Making pumpkin gnocchi dough

1. Boil water in a small pot. Once the water starts to boil add the russet potatoes and boil for 15-20 minutes. The time will vary due to the size of the potatoes. Use a fork to poke it and if the fork slides in easily it is cooked.
2. Take the russet potatoes out and let them cool down. Once it's slightly cooled down and can be handled begin to peel the skin off. Use a sharp knife and score the skin down to make it easier to peel.
3. Put the peeled cooked potato through a potato ricer to get a soft and consistent texture.
4. Lay out the paper towel and spread the pumpkin puree on top and let it sit for 2-3 minutes. Complete this step 2-3 times until the pumpkin puree is dry.
5. Mix the flour, dried pumpkin puree, potatoes and salt in a bowl. The dough should be a soft texture. Add minimal flour if the dough is too wet. Avoid adding too much flour this will make the gnocchi tough in texture once cooked.
6. Dust a flat surface with flour and pour the dough and knead for about 5 minutes. Cut the dough into 6 pieces. Roll into a 1-inch rope and cut into 1-inch wide pieces.

Forming the pumpkin shape gnocchi

1. Roll the cut pieces of dough into a ball with both of your hands in a circular motion. Press the ball down from the top to give it a flattened pumpkin shape. The best tool to create the pumpkin grooves is with a toothpick or string. Press down from the top and press along the sides. I do this 4 times on the top to create the groves all around the pumpkin.
2. Freeze for 30 minutes to keep the shape before cooking.

Cooking

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the pumpkin gnocchi for 1-2 minutes or until the pumpkin gnocchi floats to the top.
2. In a medium saucepan melt the butter and add the garlic and ginger on medium heat. Cook for 2-3 minutes until you can smell the garlic and singer infuse into the butter. Add the soy sauce and sesame oil. Stir for 30 seconds and add the cook pumpkin gnocchi and mix well. Place the cloves on top of each pumpkin gnocchi to make them look more realistic.
3. Serve immediately. Remember to remove the cloves as they aren’t edible.

**Tips**

Freeze the pumpkin-shaped gnocchi in the freezer for 30 minutes to hold the shape better before cooking.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/yvapkd/pumpkin_shaped_gnocchi_with_asianinspired_butter/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/yvapkd/pumpkin_shaped_gnocchi_with_asianinspired_butter/

**Ingredients**

* 1 tbsp butter
* 8 oz of penne pasta
* 2 1/2 cups water or broth
* 14 oz can of crushed tomatoes
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/4 cup vodka
* 1/2 onion, diced small
* 3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning
* 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper
* 1/8 tsp black pepper
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan, plus more for topping
* 1 tsp salt

**Instructions**

**STEP 1**

Using a pan over medium-high heat or the saute mode of your multi-function pressure cooker, melt the butter and add the onions. Cook until translucent and soft, 3-5 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook until no longer raw.

**STEP 2**

Pour in the vodka and cook, stirring, until mostly evaporated; about a minute. Then add the crushed tomatoes, spices, herbs, and salt. Cook until this resembles a paste, stirring occasionally.

**STEP 3**

Add the water and pasta, stirring to dissolve the paste into the water and mixing everything together.

**STEP 4**

**FOR STOVETOP:**

Reduce the heat to medium, then cover the pan with a lid cooking until the noodles are done per package instructions or to your taste. Stir every few minutes to prevent the noodles from sticking together. If the noodles aren’t cooked to your liking by the time the liquid is reduced to a thick sauce, just add an extra quarter cup of water and give it a stir, then continue to simmer until it’s done.

**FOR INSTANT POT, NINJA FOODI, OR PRESSURE COOKER:**

Close the lid and cook on high pressure for two to four minutes, depending on what the table above suggests for your brand of pasta or choosing the time the table suggests that most closely matches your boil time. When the time is up, do a manual release of pressure by turning the valve and waiting for the hissing to stop or until it’s safe to open. Then open it and proceed to the next step.

**STEP 5**

Stir in the cream and parmesan cheese, stirring until the parmesan cheese melts into the sauce. At this point, stir in any add-ins or top with more cheese, then serve and enjoy!

* Spaghetti ̴ 60 grams
* Olive oil ̴ 25 grams

* Onion ̴ 60 grams
* Dried parsley, oregano, thyme ̴ 5 grams each ̴ 15 grams all together
* Sugar ̴ 6 grams
* Chilli flakes ̴ 2 grams
* Tomato puree ̴ 60 grams
* Milk ̴ 40 grams
* Cheddar cheese ̴ 15 grams
* Basil ̴ 2 to 3 medium sized leaves
* Black pepper ̴ 6 grams
* Italian seasoning ̴ 6 grams

DIRECTIONS

1. Cook the spaghetti according to packet instructions in salt water. Save some of that pasta water. Keep it al dante.
2. Chopping isn’t fun but you gotta do what you gotta do. Chop the onion into small cubes and garlic finely.
3. I prefer cast iron in this kind of recipes but you can use non-stick or any kind. Add some (or may be, a lot more than ‘some’) olive oil. Keep the heat on medium.
4. Add the garlic and onion. Fry for a minute. Don't burn it or brown it too much.
5. Next, add the dried herbs and chili flakes and a pinch or two of sugar. Fry until the onion’s translucent.
6. Time for the tomato puree to go in. Mix well and cook for 2 minutes.
7. Add a splash of milk and mix and cook for 2 minutes.
8. Drop a little pasta water and cover &amp; cook for 10 to 12 minutes or until the raw smell of tomato disappears.
9. Uncover and do a taste check. If needed, add salt (most probably, you won’t need to add anything).
10. Add the cheese and cover until the cheese melts.
11. Now add the spaghetti and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
12. Rip the basils and drop ‘em in the pasta.
13. Serve hot with a sprinkle of black pepper and Italian seasoning.
14. TIPS or so: Do NOT cook the spaghetti and store it. Cook the spaghetti WHILE you make the sauce. This will give a better taste and texture to your spaghetti.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/y738gk/spaghetti_cooked_in_classic_marinara_sauce/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/y738gk/spaghetti_cooked_in_classic_marinara_sauce/

Time: 30 min

**Ingredients**

* \~10 oz turkey Lit’l Smokies cocktail franks, \~⅔ of package (can sub other varieties, but turkey are the healthiest)
* 8 oz short pasta such as anelletti or ditalini (can use any short pasta)
* 1 10.8 oz can condensed tomato soup
* ⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for topping
* ¼ cup half-and-half
* ½ tbsp freshly minced garlic
* ¼ cup fresh basil leaves, julienned (optional, for topping)
* 2 tbsp butter
* ¾ cup chicken stock, or sub water

* olive oil

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions**

1. Begin bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta. Around step 3 add the pasta to the water and cook per package instructions for al dente (usually around 15 min for anelletti). Drain and set aside until needed.
2. Pat the little smokies dry with paper towels and cut them into thirds (I do an angled cut).
3. Warm a drizzle of olive oil (about 2 tsp) over medium heat in a large skillet. Once warm, add the sliced sausages and cook, stirring occasionally, until they’re crispy, about 3-5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm, do not wipe the skillet clean.
4. Reduce heat to medium-low and add the butter to the pan. Once melted, add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring constantly, for about 1 minute (should be fragrant), then add the condensed soup (do NOT add the water as directed on the can). Mix to incorporate.
5. To the soup add the half-and-half, chicken stock, white sugar, onion powder, thyme, oregano, and black pepper. Raise the heat to medium to bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.
6. Add the parmesan and mix until fully melted and incorporated. Taste the sauce and add salt to taste if desired.
7. Remove the skillet from heat. Add in the cooked pasta and sausages, mix together. Serve immediately, topped with more parmesan and fresh basil.

&amp;#x200B;

Above is the recipe as stated from [this source](https://www.purewow.com/recipes/jalapeno-avocado-mac-and-cheese)

I was excited about the jalapeño/avocado combination, but I have a standard creamy Mac &amp; cheese recipe I’ve been using for years, so I decided to merge the two. Below is what I ended up doing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients**

**Mac &amp; cheese**

* 1lb conchigliette (mini shell) pasta
* 4 tbsp butter
* 1/4 cup flour
* 4oz can of green chiles
* 2 fresh jalapeños, roughly chopped. (I left the membrane and seeds in because mine is a spicy household, but you can scrape out the interior if you don’t like spice.)
* 5 green onions, roughly chopped
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 cup milk
* 8 oz ghost pepper cheddar
* 4 oz gruyere
* 4 oz white American cheese
* 2-3oz white Vermont cheddar (the previous three cheeses would have been fine, but I had a bit of extra Vermont cheddar that needed to be used so I threw it in as well.)
* 1 tbsp sodium citrate
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp MSG
* 1/2 tsp dijon mustard
* 1 tsp hot sauce

**Topping**

* 2 tbsp butter
* 1/2 cup panko

The directions are basically the same as above. The only alterations are that I added the last five ingredients to the sauce once the cheeses started to melt and thicken. Some people might say the sodium citrate is unnecessary if I’m already adding American cheese, but all I know is that I’ve been tweaking this Mac &amp; cheese recipe for a long time and this combination is perfect for that thick, creamy consistency I love.

Once the pasta was mixed in, I put the combined Mac &amp; cheese in an oven safe dish then topped it with the butter+panko mixture and baked at 375F for about 15 min.

Unfortunately, once I opened one, it turned out my avocados were not yet ripe so I wasn’t even able to use them. Oh well. It was absolutely delicious as is and I’m looking forward to trying it again with avos. It’s a heavy dish so maybe in a month or two.

We also topped it with pulled pork and chopped fresh parsley, basil, and green onion. It’s not nearly as pretty or color corrected as the picture from the original recipe, but here’s the finished result: [link](https://i.imgur.com/ezhGOHz.jpg)

This is for a 5-ingredient project that I'm testing recipes for so that's why the ingredients are sparse! You can definitely add to this recipe. Garlic, spinach, kale, or cherry tomatoes would be great additions! If you eat meat, you can also add a protein like sweet Italian sausage or grilled chicken.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced
* 1 cup loosely packed basil, divided
* 8 ounces plant-based or dairy cream cheese
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (or basil-flavored oil)
* 16 ounces paccheri or rigatoni
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Roughly chop the basil and set it aside.
2. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook, stirring often, for 25–30 minutes until caramelized. Stir regularly and adjust the heat as needed to prevent the onions from burning. Season with salt and pepper.
3. As the onion cooks, combine the cream cheese and half the basil in a food processor. Pulse until completely blended. Add water, as needed, in tablespoon increments until the mixture is smooth and creamy. You will likely need 2–3 tablespoons of water total. Season with salt, to taste.
4. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the paccheri and cook until al dente. Scoop out 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta and set it aside.
5. Add the pasta cooking water to the caramelized onions and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes or until the liquid reduces by half. Add the remaining basil and the pasta and cook for an additional minute or two. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Turn off the heat.
6. Spoon the basil cream onto plates and smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Pile the pasta on top of the cream and serve with a few additional basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil if you like.

This is for a 5-ingredient vegan project I'm working on (not including oil, water, salt, and pepper) You can add more ingredients to the sauce as you like. My sun-dried tomatoes are preserved with garlic, but you can add minced garlic to the sauce. Or you can sauté a diced onion or shallot prior to adding the sun-dried tomatoes to the pot.

If you're not vegan, a splash of cream to finish the sauce would be delicious too. And if you want a bit of protein, some diced grilled chicken would be great in this.

Spinach would also be a great addition. Add it to the sauce before stirring in the pasta.

**INGREDIENTS:**

* 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, diced
* 1 tablespoon of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes
* 4 ears of sweet corn, husked and cut from the cob
* 1 cup water or vegetable stock
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
* 1 ounce fresh basil, thinly sliced, a few leaves left whole and reserved for garnish
* 16 ounces dry rigatoni or orecchiette
* Extra virgin olive oil for garnish
* Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

**METHOD:**

**Cook the tomatoes:**

* Add 1 tablespoon of oil from the jar of sun-dried tomatoes to a wide pot. Turn the heat to medium.
* Once hot, add the diced sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes until softened. Add the corn and cook an additional 3–5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.

**Simmer the sauce:**

* Pour in the water or vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Add the halved cherry tomatoes and reduce heat and simmer for 15–20 minutes. The liquid should reduce by half. Taste and season once more to your preferences.
* Finish the sauce by adding the sliced basil. Toss to combine.

**Cook the pasta:**

* As the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook the rigatoni until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta.
* Add the pasta cooking water to the sauce and bring it to a boil. Add the pasta and reduce heat to low. Toss to coat for 1–2 minutes until glossy. Turn off the heat and season one final time to your preferences.

**To serve:**

* Divide the cooked pasta between bowls. Garnish with a few basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, if you like.

Deep fry your beef and set it aside.


2. Boil your pasta with some salt for 3 minutes less, drain the water and set it aside.


3. Chop fresh tomatoes and other vegetables. Pour some oil into a pan, throw some chopped onions into it and let the onions fry for about 2 minutes.

4. Once tomatoes are cooked, add stock from your cooked beef and stir. Then add half a cup of water and leave it to cook. After 10 minutes, add one shrimp Maggi cube, grated ginger, grated garlic, and the other spices which are; one teaspoon of black pepper, one teaspoon of chili powder pepper, and one teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of curry powder, 1/4 teaspoon of oregano and stir. Add another half cup of water and leave it to boil for 7 more minutes.


5. Then add chopped bell pepper, mushrooms, and chopped carrots, and leave it to cook. After 5 minutes, add spinach and fried beef, and again, leave it to cook.


6. After about 3 minutes, add your boiled pasta and let it sit on the fire for 3 more minutes.

I was never too fond of meatballs until I tried this recipe, it takes a bit of prep but it's well worth it. Now it's a family favorite.

Instructional video for my [meatball recipe here](https://youtu.be/ceUqCCLAnLY)

**INGREDIENTS**

**For the meatballs**
* 500g pork mince




* 500g beef mince


* Salt


* 100g good quality bead (sourdough, ciabatta etc) crusts removed


* 100ml milk 


* 1 beaten egg

 
* 50g parmesan (plus extra to serve)


* 1 handful of chopped parsley (plus extra to serve) 


* 1 pinch of nutmeg


* 1 tbsp dried oregano


* 6 cloves of garlic


* Salt and pepper


**For the sauce**
* Olive oil

* 4 cloves garlic, slices

* 1 cup red wine

* 1 tbsp red wine vinegar

* 3 tins chopped tomatoes

* Salt and pepper


**STEPS**

1. Season the pork and beef with salt and combine. Set aside and in a separate bowl combine the milk and bread.
2. Leave to rest for 30 minutes.
3. Add the bread/milk mixture to the meat along with the remaining meatball ingredients. Season well and combine.
4. Form into meatballs, I like them somewhere between a golf ball and tennis ball in size, then refrigerate for 1 hour.
5. When ready to cook, heat the olive oil in a pan and cook in batches then set aside.
6. In the same pan, add the remaining oil and fry off the garlic for 1-2 minutes.
7. Add the wine and vinegar to the pan and make sure you scrape the pan to release all of the charred meatball juice.
8. Add the tomatoes, season well and leave to simmer for 10 minutes.
9. Return the meatballs to the pan and continue to simmer for at least 20 minutes.
10. Serve with homemade pasta, chopped parsley and parmasan.

**TIPS**
* The fattier your meat the better it will taste - we're not here to lose weight. I used 20% fat beef and 12% fat pork.


* Meatballs can be made the day before and left in the fridge.


* The more browning you get on your meatballs and in the pan the better your sauce will taste.


* The longer you simmer the sauce before adding the meatballs the thicker and richer it will become.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/u8gmzk/family_favourite_meatball_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/u8gmzk/family_favourite_meatball_recipe/

* 15 basil leaves roughly chopped, plus more for serving
* ½ cup mascarpone cheese
* 16 ounces rigatoni penne, or ziti, 1/2 cup pasta cooking water reserved
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### For serving:

* Chili oil optional

### Instructions

#### Brown the sausage:

* Heat the olive oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook for 15 minutes, breaking it up as it cooks. Once the sausage is completely cooked through, transfer it to a bowl.

#### Cook the aromatics:

* Add the onion and sweet potato to the rendered fat from the sausage. Cook over medium heat for 8–9 minutes until just beginning to brown and soften. Season with salt and pepper.
* Add the minced garlic and red Fresno chili pepper to the pot and cook for 1 minute.
* Create a well in the middle of the vegetables and add the butter. Once melted and bubbly, add the oregano and thyme and let them sizzle in the butter for 30–45 seconds. Toss to coat the vegetables with spices.

#### Deglaze the pot:

* Pour in the water, stock, or wine, and scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat.

#### Simmer the ragù:

* Add the tomatoes and the cooked sausage to the pot. Add the maple syrup or sugar, and then season with salt and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, for 30–45 minutes. Stir the ragù occasionally, breaking up the tomatoes and lightly mashing the sweet potato as it cooks. Taste and season once more with salt and pepper.

#### Finish the ragù:

* Taste the ragù and season once more. Add the chopped basil and the mascarpone cheese and cook for 5 minutes more.

#### Cook the pasta:

* While the ragù simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the rigatoni until al dente. Next, scoop out 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water.

#### Sauce the pasta:

* Drain the ragu and add it to the sauce and toss to coat. Add a bit of the pasta cooking water to thin out the seasoning. You may not use it all! Turn off the heat once the pasta is glossy and coated with the sauce.

#### To serve:

* Divide the pasta between shallow bowls and garnish with more basil. Add a drizzle of chili oil, if you like. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tk8t5a/sweet_potato_and_sausage_ragu/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tk8t5a/sweet_potato_and_sausage_ragu/
szo5v5,"Vegetarian Caramelized Onion ""Carbonara""",2087,42,1645640590.0,0.96,Pasta,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/ni0tw52qkmj81.jpg,"**Recipe here originally: [Caramelized Onion “Carbonara”](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/caramelized-onion-carbonara-recipe/)**

This caramelized onion ""carbonara"" recipe is a vegetarian take on the Roman classic. While there is no guanciale in this dish, smoked shoyu adds a great meaty flavor.

If you don't have smoked shoyu, you can add a touch of liquid smoke to taste or simply replace it with a touch of soy sauce.

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 55 minutes

Servings: 4 

Calories: 629kcal

### Equipment

* Wide sauté pan
* Large pot
* Whisk
* Colander, if needed

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 2 yellow onions peeled and diced
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 16 ounces spaghetti, rigatoni, or bucatini
* 1–2 tablespoons smoked shoyu more to taste if desired
* 4 egg yolks
* 2 eggs
* ⅓ cup freshly grated parmesan plus more for serving
* Freshly grated black pepper
* Salt

### Instructions

#### Caramelize the onions:

* In a wide sauté pan, heat the butter and extra virgin olive oil over medium heat until the butter is frothy and bubbly. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring regularly, until the onions deepen in color. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent it from burning. About 15 minutes in, add the sugar and smoked shoyu and continue cooking the onions for an additional 15–20 minutes until fully caramelized and deep, golden brown. Season with salt. Turn off the heat.

#### Cook the pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until 1–2 minutes under al dente. Scoop out 1½ cups of pasta cooking water and drain the pasta. Note: depending on how you time it, you may be ready to cook the eggs right as the pasta finishes cooking, in which case, you can just use tongs to transfer the pasta straight from the water to the pot of caramelized onions. If you aren't ready, just drain the pasta first!

#### Prepare the egg mixture:

* In a large bowl, combine the egg yolks, eggs, parmesan, and ground black pepper to taste. Whisk for 3–5 minutes until smooth and creamy. Set aside.

#### Temper the egg mixture and finish the carbonara:

* Whisking constantly, pour half of the pasta cooking water into the bowl of eggs to temper the egg mixture.
* Return the heat on the skillet of caramelized onions to medium-low. Add the cooked pasta and toss to coat with the onions.
* Keeping the heat on low, slowly add the egg mixture, tossing regularly, until completely coated. Turn off the heat as soon as the sauce is coated, and the pasta is warmed through (about 1–2 minutes). If the sauce is quite thick, add more of the remaining pasta cooking water until the sauce reaches your desired consistency. It should be glossy and stick to the pasta! Taste and season with salt and more freshly ground pepper to taste.

#### To serve:

* Immediately serve the carbonara in shallow pasta bowls and garnish with more parmesan and black pepper. Enjoy!

### Instructions

#### Mince the peppers and garlic:

* Transfer the garlic and Calabrian peppers to a food processor and pulse until minced. Set aside.

#### Start the pasta:

* Place a large pot of well-salted water on the stove and turn the heat to high.

#### Prepare the sauce:

* As you wait for the water to boil, prepare the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a wide, ovenproof pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 3–5 minutes until it begins to soften.

* Taste the sauce and season to your preferences. Add half the basil leaves to the sauce along with the baby spinach and stir until wilted. Add the diced mozzarella to the sauce and toss to combine.
* Pour in the reserved pasta cooking water along with the cooked pasta and toss to coat. Turn off the heat.

* Turn the broiler on. Arrange the mozzarella rounds on top of the pasta and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Transfer to the broiler and broil until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown, about 5-6 minutes, depending on your broiler.

#### To serve:

* Scatter the remaining basil leaves on top of the pasta and divide the pasta between shallow bowls. Serve with a touch more hot honey if you like. Enjoy!

pargn7,Pasta alla Norma (ish!),103,9,1629824603.0,1.0,Pasta,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/6s9cilhq7cj71.jpg,"When I was in Rome, I visited Tram Tram and fell in love with the orecchiette alla norma. It’s not on the menu currently, but it was orecchiette in a red sauce and topped with small pieces of pan-fried eggplant. It was then topped with grated ricotta salata (the traditional way to serve pasta alla norma!). I didn’t have ricotta salata, so I omitted it for this recipe.

For the eggplant, you can follow the Ottolenghi approach to peeling which involves alternating peeling off strips so the eggplant ends up looking like a zebra. Or, you can follow the Tram Tram (and my) approach and leave the skin on completely.

This pasta alla norma is a yummy take on pasta with crispy eggplant. Serve it with orecchiette and simple marinara for a delish dinner!

Prep Time: 45 minutes

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

 Servings: 4 

Calories: 620kcal

### Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot
* Skillet
* Sieve

### Ingredients

* ¾ pound eggplant trimmed and small-diced
* 2 pounds Roma tomatoes or use 28-ounce canned tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 10 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper more to taste if desired
* 2 tablespoons plant-based or dairy butter
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes optional
* 16 ounces orecchiette or pasta or choice
* 2 tablespoons avocado oil plus more if needed
* 15 fresh basil leaves plus more for garnish
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Prepare the eggplant:

* Transfer the diced eggplant to a sieve over a bowl and season liberally with salt. Set out at room temperature for 30 minutes as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

#### Blanch the tomatoes (if using fresh tomatoes):

* Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes until the skin splits. Transfer the tomatoes to an ice bath for 5 minutes. Once the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, remove the skins and the cores. Crush lightly with your hands and transfer to a bowl.

#### Prepare the sauce:

* Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring regularly, for 6-8 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

#### Simmer the sauce:

* Melt the butter into the garlic and onions. Once frothy, add the crushed tomatoes and mash lightly with a wooden spoon. Season with salt and pepper. Add 1/4 cup of water and bring to a boil.
* If using, add the cherry tomatoes to the sauce. Reduce heat and simmer for 35 minutes until reduced and thickened. Taste and season to your preferences.

#### Cook the pasta:

* 15 minutes before the sauce is finished, cook the pasta until al dente. Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta.

#### Cook the eggplant:

* While the pasta cooks, heat 2 tablespoons of avocado oil in a skillet. While you wait for the oil to heat, pat the eggplant dry thoroughly with paper towels.
* Cook the eggplant in batches in the hot oil for 2-3 minutes per side, stirring occasionally, until browned and crispy all over. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent the eggplant from burning. Carefully transfer the eggplant to a paper towel-lined plate.

#### Finish the sauce:

* Lightly mash the cherry tomatoes and add the torn basil to the sauce. Immediately add the pasta and a few splashes of reserved pasta water and toss to coat the pasta with the sauce. Turn off the heat.

#### To serve:

* Divide the pasta between shallow bowls and pile the hot eggplant on top. Garnish with more basil leaves, if desired. Enjoy!

This pasta salad is a perfect side dish for your next summer BBQ! One batch makes around 9-10 cups (so about 10 small side servings) perfect for a gathering.

oh6ibq,Shortcut Pumpkin Ravioli (Freezer Friendly),1360,20,1625870574.0,0.97,Pasta,yellowjacquet,https://i.redd.it/4ifnqb1gm9a71.jpg,"Shortcut pumpkin ravioli!! Get the delicious homemade filling without the hassle of making fresh pasta!

This is one of my favorite freezer meals to make, it’s so easy to pull these out for a quick lunch or dinner. They use premade dumpling wrappers to skip the process of forming the ravioli from scratch (which has its place, but for me that’s much less often)! For a quick lunch I will just serve them tossed in olive oil, but if I’m pulling them out for dinner I like to dress them up with browned butter and fresh thyme as pictured.

You can also use this as a filling in standard ravioli with the dough made from scratch and it’s delicious, or apply this trick with your favorite ravioli filling. The result is a thinner pasta than a traditional ravioli but still a delicious meal.

# Shortcut Pumpkin Ravioli

**Makes:  50 rav, 6 servings  (\~8 rav per serving)**

# Ingredients

**For batch prep:**

* 2  15 oz cans of unflavored pumpkin puree
* 1 pack of 50 dumpling/potsticker wrappers
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 1 cup freshly grated parmesan (see note)
* 4 tbsp butter
* 3 tbsp light brown sugar
* ¼ tsp ground nutmeg
* Salt

**To prepare each serving (see instructions):**

* 1 tbsp salted butter or olive oil
* 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves (optional)

**Notes**

I do not recommend using canned parmesan in this recipe, it does not melt down as nicely.

# Instructions

1. Make sure your garlic is minced and parmesan is grated before beginning. Open your cans of pumpkin so they can be quickly added in a later step. In a small bowl combine the nutmeg, brown sugar, and 1 tsp of salt.
2. Melt the butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Once melted, stir frequently until the butter browns and gives off a nutty smell, about 1 to 3 minutes depending on the temp of your stove. Once the butter is lightly browned add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 more minute.
3. Quickly add the pumpkin to the skillet and mix to incorporate it into the butter and garlic mixture. Cook the pumpkin over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes.
4. Sprinkle the sugar/salt/nutmeg mixture over the pumpkin in the skillet and mix to incorporate. Continue cooking for another 2 minutes.
5. Remove from heat and mix in the grated parm, stir until it’s fully incorporated. Allow the mixture to cool to room temp before filling the ravioli.
6. To fill, place a leveled tablespoon of filling on the dumpling wrapper, slightly off-center (I use a cookie scoop for this step). Dip your finger into a small bowl of water and wet along the edge of the wrapper to seal, then fold the wrapper in half to create a semicircle. Pinch the wrapper closed, pressing from the edges in towards the center to avoid squeezing out any filling. (Optionally, press the tines of a fork around the edge to create the ridged ravioli look, this is just for looks and is not needed to seal the ravioli, typically I skip this step to save time.) \[Note -- I have a picture that explains this better on my post to another sub, this sub doesnt allow multiple images\]

**To Freeze:**

* Arrange the rav on a cookie sheet so they do not tough, freeze for 15+ mins then transfer to a zip bag to freeze long term. (If freezing, do not skip the cookie sheet step, otherwise they will all stick together in the bag and be ruined).

**To Prepare:**

* Boil the rav for 2 minutes (from frozen), or \~90 seconds (fresh). I recommend freezing them first to help them hold their shape a bit better even if you’re preparing them right away.
* Toss each serving (\~8 rav) in 1 tbsp of browned butter or 1 tbsp of olive oil, then optionally top with 1 tsp of fresh thyme leaves. (For a quick lunch I just do the olive oil, for a nicer meal I do the brown butter + thyme). To prepare the browned butter melt butter over medium heat, mix constantly until the butter begins to brown, then remove from heat and let cool for \~3 mins before using.

**Enjoy the recipe and** [**our United Cuisines show on YouTube!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2sN4bTXW0U)

*INGREDIENTS*:

\- cannelloni pasta \[14-18 tubes / 7 oz / 200 g\]

\- spinach \[1 pound / 450 g\]

\- olive oil \[2 tbsp / 30 ml\]

\- garlic \[2 cloves\]

\- ground nutmeg \[1/4 tsp\]

\- salt &amp; pepper

\- onion \[1 medium-sized\]

\- canned plum tomatoes \[14 oz / 400 g\]

\- canned cherry tomatoes \[14 oz / 400 g\]

\- basil leaves \[a handful\]

\- lemon juice \[1 tbsp / 15 ml\]

\- a bay leaf \[optional\]

\- one large egg

\- oregano \[1 tsp\]

\- ricotta cheese \[1.1 lbs / 500 g\]

\- Parmigiano Reggiano \[4.2 oz / 120 g\]

\- mozzarella \[4.4 oz / 125 g\]

\- young gouda cheese \[4.4 oz / 125 g\]

Servings: 6

*INSTRUCTIONS*:

1. Over medium-low heat, sauté one crushed garlic in 1 tablespoon olive oil for a minute and add the spinach (all of the spinach might not fit at once, but it will wilt a lot, so add one batch after another into the pan)
2. With a kitchen tong, mix and turn spinach upside down until fully cooked (wilted and takes on a dark green color). Put in a bowl and set aside to cool down
3. Finely chop the onion and sauté in the empty pan with a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-low heat for a few minutes till translucent
4. Crush in a garlic clove and sauté together for another minutes
5. Add the canned plum and cherry tomatoes by scrunching them through your clean hands over the pan
6. Add a handful of basil leaves (chopped) and the lemon juice, as well as one bay leaf (optional)
7. Let simmer for approximately 20 minutes till sauce thickens a bit. Season to taste with salt &amp; pepper
8. Squeeze the spinach, which should have cooled down by now, and chop it in small pieces. Discard the spinach water
9. In a big enough bowl, mix the spinach with the ricotta, an egg and a handful of grated Parmigiano Reggiano. Season to taste after thoroughly mixing it
10. Spread a bit of tomato sauce over the casserole pan
11. Start injecting the spinach-ricotta mix into the cannelloni (we used an icing-bag) and place them in the casserole pan
12. Pour all of the remaining tomato sauce evenly over all cannelloni and sprinkle with a teaspoon of oregano
13. Grate the cheese you want to use for the casserole's top: we used mozzarella \[4.4 oz / 125 g\], young gouda \[4.4 oz / 125 g\] and Parmigiano Reggiano \[2.8 oz / 80 g\]
14. Cover everything with the grated cheese and cook in pre-heated oven \[355°F / 180°C\] for 30-40 minutes. We put it on the lower third part of our electric top-down-heat oven an it turned out great. It might differ in your oven! If cheese darkens too quickly, cover with alu foil
15. Let cool down for a few minutes and enjoy!

na4j9l,Butter poached lobster with a parmesan herb butter linguine!,3081,68,1620759282.0,0.99,Pasta,The__Grapist,https://i.redd.it/58obvnhtfjy61.jpg,"RECIPE!!

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------

&amp;#x200B;

\* Linguine

\* 

\* Two small or one large lobster tail

\* 

\* 4 sticks of COLD butter for the poach, +3 tablespoons for the sauce

\* 

\* 4 cloves of garlic

\* 

\* 3 Tablespoons of fresh oregano

\* 

\* 3 Tablespoons of fresh parsley

\* 

\* 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan, +more for plating

\* 

\* 3/4 cup of heavy cream

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Linguine noodles boiled in heavily salted water to just about al dente.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

FOR THE LOBSTER

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The lobster was butter poached, so I took about a tablespoon and a half of water, boiled it, reduced the temperature to low and added a clove of smashed garlic and some cracked black pepper, adding a tablespoon of COLD butter and whisking maniacally until just about dissolved and then adding another tablespoon of butter, repeat that, whisking nonstop until all of your butter is melted. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for the nonstop whisking is you're creating a butter emulsification to poach the lobster in. The amount of butter you'll need will vary depending on the amount of lobster you have and the size of your pot. You want the lobster to be fully submerged! 

&amp;#x200B;

The cook time will vary on the size of your lobster tail, so about 5-8 minutes is a safe bet. You don't want to overcook it! 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

FOR THE SAUCE

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Start off with 3 tablespoons of butter on medium low temperature to melt it, add 3 cloves of smashed garlic, let that cook for a few minutes to get that butter all garlicy and junk, add the fresh oregano and parsley and about a cup of the pasta water, bring that to a simmer, add a half a cup of fresh grated parmesan, getting it all melty and delicious, after that's all melted, add 3/4 a cup of cream, bring that to a simmer, add desired amount of pasta to pan, get it all stirred up and junk and let it all get to know each other over medium low heat for about 10 minutes until the sauce thickens up to your desired consistency!

&amp;#x200B;

Plate up and top with some more grated parmesan and some of that delicious lobster poaching butter sauce! EZPZ",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/na4j9l/butter_poached_lobster_with_a_parmesan_herb/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/na4j9l/butter_poached_lobster_with_a_parmesan_herb/

1. **Start with the sauce**: in this recipe I like to use a combination of red lentils and tomato sauce
2. **Make the white cream**: in a pan fry the chopped onion and garlic, in a bit of Olive oil for about 2 minutes. Then pour the soy cream and let it steer for around 8-10minutes. 
3. **Grab the lasagna pasta**: follow the instruction on the pasta box for having it ready. 
4. **Layer it u**p: Start with a little sauce in the bottom of the pan to ensure your noodles don’t stick to the bottom, then top with noodles, cream, and sauce and then repeat. Dump allllll of that extra mozzarella on the top for good measure!
5. **Cover and bak**e: Covering the lasagna with foil to bake ensures that the moisture stays inside and cooks the noodles. We will uncover once we add the cheese and let it sit at room temperature for some time before slicing to help it set well.

Ingredients


16 Oz. Pasta of choice

Water, for boiling

Lots of salt, for pasta water


1 lb. Ground Beef or Lamb

1 Medium Sweet Onion, diced

6 Garlic Cloves, minced

1 Large Carrot, peeled &amp; grated (fine)

1 28-oz. Can San Marzano Tomatoes

1 Tbsp. Tomato Paste

2 Tbsp. Salted Butter

Oregano, Dried Oregano, Red Pepper Flakes, Salt &amp; Pepper, to taste

Parmesan Cheese &amp; Black Pepper for topping

Steps

Sauce:

1. In a large pan with high sides, (or a dutch oven), melt butter over medium-high heat.

2. Once butter is melted, add diced onion and stir to coat with butter. Add a pinch of salt, cook onion until soft and translucent, stirring semi-frequently, about 5-10 minutes.

3. Once the onion is cooked, add garlic to an open space in the pot and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly browned and fragrant. Once lightly browned, stir together with the onion.

4. Push onion and garlic mixture to the edge of the pan and add the ground beef or lamb. Break up the meat with a wooden spoon, season with more salt, and cook until no pink remains.

5. Once the meat is cooked, reduce the heat to medium then add tomato paste, grated carrot, and canned tomatoes. Stir to fully combine.

6. Add herbs and spices to your liking, (about a teaspoon of each to start), and stir to combine.

7. Allow sauce to simmer, and once the sauce has been reduced slightly, (less watery liquid), turn the heat to low and keep covered while you prepare the pasta. (I recommend lifting the lid occasionally to give a quick stir. Also, taste a small amount of the sauce and adjust the seasoning to your liking, such as adding more salt, pepper, basil, etc.)

Pasta &amp; Assembly:

1. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat.

2. Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add a generous amount of salt and stir to combine.

3. Add pasta and cook al dente according to box directions, stirring occasionally.

4. With about half a minute left in the pasta’s cook time, reserve a small amount, (roughly half a cup), of the pasta water and set it aside.

5. Drain pasta then immediately add to the pan with sauce. Toss to combine. (When combining the pasta and the sauce, slowly drizzle in some of the pasta water to help the sauce bind to the pasta. You don’t need to use all of what you’ve set aside, but it’s better to have too much reserved than too little.)

6. Remove the pan from the heat and serve. Either transfer to a large serving dish or serve into bowls straight from the pan.

7. Top with grated parmesan and a few grinds of black pepper.

The ingredients are simple and genuine, the making of tortellini requires a little time and commitment but the taste worth the effort without doubt.

Fun fact: Legend claims that Tortellini was inspired by the goddess Venus' navel. One evening after a day of battle between Bologna and Modena, Venus, Bacchus and Mars found refreshment at the inn Corona in Castelfranco Emilia. The next morning Mars and Bacchus moved away from the inn leaving Venus dormant;

When she woke up, she called the other companions to hear where they were. the innkeeper came to see if he could help and saw the little-dressed goddess was so impressed by its splendid shapes that he returned to the kitchen and created a pasta inspired by Venus' navel…and so was born the Tortellini.

* 150 gr ( 5.29 ounce ) grated parmigiano
* 10 gr ( 0.35 ounce )  butter
* 2 eggs
* nutmeg
* black pepper
* salt

&amp;#x200B;

For the dough

* 320 gr ( 11.29 ounce ) all-purpose  flour
* 80 gr ( 2.82 ounce ) semolina flour
* 4 eggs
* 25 gr ( 0.88 ounce ) extra virgin olive oil
* salt

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTION**

* in a pan put 10 gr butter and 100 gr pork loin diced
* let the pork loin brown well and drain from the excess of butter
* in a meat grinder put the pork loin, 100 gr mortadella and 100 gr cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )
* add to the mixture half nutmeg grated, 150 gr grated parmigiano, black pepper and 2 eggs
* Mix well the mixture and add salt if needed ( you should taste the mixture because the flavor can vary depending on the type of cured ham and mortadella)
* cover with a plastic wrap and let it rest for 2 hours

Now let's prepare the homemade pasta as usual so 1 egg every 100 gr flours. For the flours we will use all-purpose and semolina flour in a proportion 4 to 1 so for this filling about 320 gr all-purpose and 80 gr semolina flour

* Put the flours on a pastry board making a hole in the center where you will put 4 whole eggs and 25 gr extra virgin olive oil.
* With a fork amalgamate the eggs and let the flour be incorporated, salt the dough and continue this operation until it will be possible to work it by hand.
* work the dough until it is smooth and even. Leave it to rest in a film in the fridge for 30 minutes at least.
* work the dough with a rolling pin and divide in several part
* now with the help of a pasta machine begin to lower the thickness of the dough
* the dough will be ready when it is less of one millimetre thick. I usually use the lower setting of thickness
* now cut the pasta dough to obtain squares 4 cm long, i use a pasta cutter to obtain several squares at the time and speed up the process
* Take a pasta square and put a little of filling in the middle then fold the square into a triangle. Finally, roll up the triangle and join the angles creating the typical shape of the tortellini like you can see in the video
* if the pasta dries too much you can moisten the edges of the dough square with a finger wetted in a little water. this will help to seal the tortellini.
* Put the tortellini on a tray lined with parchment paper. If you want you can also frozen tortellini, to do so put the tray in freezer a few hours, in this way they will remain intact and will not stick during freezing, when the tortellini are well frozen you can transfer them in bags to save space in the freezer
* Cook tortellini into boiling beef and poultry stock. If frozen, do not unfreeze.
* You can also prepare tortellini without broth. Cook them in abundant salted water, when they are ready ( 4/5 minutes usually) drain them and season with a heavy cream sauce with ham and peas. If you want more precise instruction for this kind of seasoning ask in the comment section

kaqoeu,How to Make Italian Lasagna! The Traditional Italian Recipe,1611,114,1607643837.0,0.96,Pasta,italian_cook,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kaqoeu,"Lasagna is an italian dish know in all the world. This is a classic recipe, tasty and delightful, simple mouth watering. If you want to see the [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/hCcA34_jD9w) and if you want to subs you are welcome \^\_\^

The quantity are for a baking dish 22 x 31 cm servings for 8/10, well in my family is more for 6/7 but we love lasagna!

Ingredients Servings for 8/10

* Salt
* Black Pepper
* Grated Parmigiano

Bolognese sauce:

* 500 gr minced beef
* 250 gr minced pork
* 1 celery ribs
* 1 onion
* 1 carrot
* 120 gr extra virgin olive oil
* 130 gr tomato paste
* 500 ml water
* 1 glass red wine

Bechamel Sauce

* 100 gr butter
* 100 gr all purpose flour
* 1 liter milk nutmeg

Homemade Lasagna sheet

* 200 gr all purpose flour
* 200 gr semolina flour
* 4 eggs
* 28 gr extra virgin olive oil

Lasagna have several separate preparation so let's begin with the longest one, ragu bolognese

* chop finely 1 celery ribs, 1 onion, 1 carrot in a large size pot put the vegetables and 120 gr extra virgin olive oil
* when the vegetables are browned add 500 gr minced beef and 250 gr minced pork when the meat is well browned and the liquid is a bit evaporated add 1 glass of red wine and let it fade
* add 130 gr tomato paste and mix well after that add 500 ml water
* cover with a lid and cook at medium/low heat for 2 hours and half stirring occasionally

meanwhile we can prepare homemade lasagne or bought it at the grocery

* Put all-purpose flour and semolina flour on a pastry board in equal amount ( for example 150 gr all purpose and 150 gr semolina flour ), making a hole in the center where we will put 1 whole eggs every 100 gr flours and 7 gr extra virgin olive oil every 100 gr flours
* With a fork we amalgamate the eggs and let the flour be incorporated
* salt the dough and continue this operation until it will be possible to work it by hand.
* work the dough until it is smooth and even.
* Leave it to rest in a film in the fridge for 30 minutes at least.

Now let's prepare béchamel sauce

* in a medium size pot put 100 gr butter and let it melt
* add 100 gr all purpose flour and mix well Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.
* Slowly add 1 liter milk, one ladle at a time whisking constantly, until mixture is smooth.
* Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, for 10 to 12 minutes or until sauce comes to thickens
* Add a pinch of nutmeg and salt and let the bechamel sauce cool

For homemade lasagna

* work the dough with a rolling pin and divide in several part now with the help of a pasta machine begin to lower the thickness of the dough
* the dough will be ready when it is one millimetre thick or a little more
* make large rectangles, i usually do 15 x 10 cm

If we use homemade lasagne we don't need to cook them first take a baking dish and let's compose our lasagne

* Put a ladle of ragu, a ladle of bechamel and a handful of parmigiano and mix
* let's cover with the pasta and repeat this operation until the baking dish is full
* i suggest between 6 to 8 layers at max

If instead you want to use bought pasta you should cook the lasagna sheets before you put in the baking dish, even if there is written in the instruction that you can put directly in the baking dish, is better to cook them for 3/4 minutes. In this way you don't have to do a too liquid bechamel

For a baking dish 22 x 31 cm you will need about 450 gr lasagna sheet, 900 gr bolognese sauce and 700 gr bechamel sauce

For a baking dish 22 x 16 cm instead about 300 gr lasagna sheet, 500 gr bolognese and 400 gr bechamel

* Cook the lasagna in oven for 30 minutes at 190° and let it cool a bit before serving

k6ra3q,Creamy Kabocha Pasta,1456,30,1607108856.0,0.97,Pasta,TheGrumpyGarbanzo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/k6ra3q,"# [Creamy Kabocha Pasta](http://grumpygarbanzo.com/Meals/Creamy%20Kabocha%20Pasta/)

A kabocha squash makes an excellent door stop. It's hefty enough to prop your door firmly open while allowing the world to view your superb taste in squash. I know this because I bought a kabocha squash on a whim, ignored it for a week, and demoted it from food to doorstop for another week because I was too intimidated to attempt Thai curry at home.

But you know what's less intimidating than curry? Pasta.

This recipe boils down to a few steps (see what I did there?): roasting kabocha squash and removing the peel, caramelizing an onion, blending and seasoning the sauce, cooking pasta, and baking the squash skin to create a crunchy and pretentious topping. I seasoned my peels with smoked paprika for bacon vibes. You can blend the squash skin–and–all, but the sauce may turn an unpleasant color due to the dark peel mixing with the bright orange flesh. I hesitate to give exact measurements for the sauce because everyone has different taste preferences; just add small amounts of seasonings at a time, taste test, and stop messing with it when you've made a delicious sauce or are too tired to care anymore.

# What:

1 kabocha squash

1 yellow onion

garlic

non-dairy milk

orecchiette pasta

olive oil

seasonings:

* nutritional yeast
* tomato paste
* apple cider vinegar and/or sour kraut juice
* vegan chicken broth paste
* soy sauce
* chili paste or flakes
* smoked paprika
* salt &amp; pepper

# How:

Pasta:

* Cook orecchiette according to package. Reserve some pasta water (about 1/3 cup) for the sauce.

Blend the sauce:

* Remove baked squash from the oven and let it cool enough that you can handle it without burning yourself.
* Use a spoon to scoop the flesh of the squash from the skins and into a blender.
* Add enough oat milk to allow the squash to blend into a paste. Make the sauce thicker than you would like, because it will be thinned by additional liquid ingredients.
* Blend in the caramelized onions.
* Now comes the experimentational part of the recipe: seasoning the sauce. This should be done to taste, but I'll explain what the ingredients do for the sauce and give rough estimations of the quantities I used. Melted vegan butter or oil (1.5 tbsp) will create a rich, creamy base. Our umami friends: tomato paste (1.5 tbsp), vegan chicken broth paste (1 tsp), and soy sauce (1 tbsp); add these a little at a time. Nutritional yeast (2–3 tbsp) will provide that almost–cheesy flavor. Apple cider vinegar or sour kraut juice will give you a much–needed tang to balance out the richness; add a little at a time. I think you know what chilis, salt, and pepper do. Use pasta water to thin the sauce to your final desired consistency.

Crispy topping:

* Toss or spritz the squash skins with oil. Salt and pepper to taste.
* Bake at 450ºF until crispy.
* Sprinkle with smoked paprika for a bacon–ish flavor.

Assemble:

* Mix pasta with sauce over heat and top with crispy squash skins.

# What did I use and why?

Oat milk: I find that it is the creamiest of vegan milks.

Better than Bouillon No Chicken Base: Because this is a paste, it's ideal for adding a bit at a time without diluting the sauce.

Trader Joe's Italian Bomba Hot Pepper Sauce: I'm obsessed with this paste made from Calabrian chilis. It's fermented, but not funky, and a nice alternative to Sriracha.

k5fu1f,Cheesy Baked Layered Rigatoni With Sausage &amp; Ricotta,1550,25,1606935845.0,0.99,Pasta,swilliams2207,https://i.redd.it/pztxioemnt261.jpg,"INGREDIENTS

* 1 pound of rigatoni or ziti
* 1 pound ground sweet Italian sausage
* 1/2 pound 85% lean ground beef
* 24 ounces marinara
* 15 ounces ricotta cheese, transferred to a bowl and stirred to soften
* 8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into bite-sized cubes
* 1/3 + 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese, divided
* 6–7 chopped fresh basil leaves
* salt and pepper, to taste

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 425 °F.
2. Bring a large pot of water with a pinch of salt to a boil. Cook pasta al dente, strain, and transfer to a bowl or back into the boiling pot once it’s cooled. Stir in 1/3 cup parmesan cheese and 1 1/2 cups marinara. Mix and set aside.
3. Meanwhile, bring oil in a large pan or skillet to medium heat. Cook sausage and beef until browned and fully cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Use the tip of your spatula to break the sausage and beef into small chunks. Season with salt and pepper, to taste and set aside.
4. Take half of the pasta and layer filling the entire bottom of a 13X9 casserole dish. Layer with half of the beef and sausage mix, and then half of the ricotta cheese. Spread the ricotta with a rubber spatula, doing your best to spread thinly and evenly. It will tend to stick. It’s best to work in small dollops and spread as best you can. **It does not need to be perfect!**
5. Repeat step 4 with the remaining ingredients. Pasta, sausage/beef, then ricotta.
6. Layer top with 1 cup of marinara. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes uncovered. Remove from the oven, top with a layer of 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and all the fresh mozzarella. Bake for 20-25 additional minutes or until cheese is fully melted and starting to turn golden. Sometimes a 2-minute broil at the very end will help deliver a perfect golden singe.
7. Let cool for 10 minutes, top with basil, and serve cut in squares

* 1 pound penne, rigatoni, or ziti
* 3/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup tomato paste (about 4.5 ounces)
* 1 shallot, finely chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, minced 
* 3 tablespoons vodka
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 3–4 chopped fresh basil leaves, for garnish

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta until al dente. **Reserve 2 cups of pasta water before draining and set aside.**
2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter with olive oil. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for about 4 minutes or until very tender. Do not burn!
3. Add tomato paste, red pepper flakes, and vodka. Stir until paste fully coats the shallots and garlic. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Add **1 cup** of pasta water. Stir until smooth. Bring sauce to a simmer, add cream, and turn off the heat. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Fold in the pasta until fully coated in the sauce. Add parmesan cheese and continue to toss/mix.
5. Add additional reserved pasta water as needed (a little at a time) if the sauce is too thick. I like a creamy sauce that is just thick enough to really coat the pasta without being too runny. **I usually just do 1 cup total.**
6. Serve garnished with more Parmesan and chopped fresh basil.

I would have opted to add flour after sautéing the butter, onion and garlic to make a roux that would then thicken the addition of broth, then added the cream after that for final thickening. 
-OR- I would have made a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken the broth mixture at the end.
-OR- I would have tossed the cheese with cornstarch, but typically that only works when the cheese is a bit more “wet” than Parmesan (like a cheddar, Gouda, etc).

But it seems you aren’t using any of those methods. Are you adding cornstarch directly to the sauce? If so, how do you avoid lumps? Does cornstarch thicken well this way if not used in a slurry?",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/k3girf/skillet_chicken_broccoli_ziti_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/k3girf/skillet_chicken_broccoli_ziti_recipe/

Equipment

* Large pot
* Colander
* Wide pot

Ingredients

* 1 pound dry sea scallops muscle removed
* ¾ pound large shrimp peeled and deveined, tail removed or left on depending on preference
* 16 ounces dry linguine
* 4 tablespoons butter divided
* 2 teaspoons cooking oil plus more, as needed
* 2 shallots peeled and finely diced
* 1 fennel bulb fronds reserved, bulb cored and finely diced
* 4 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 1 pint cocktail tomatoes halved or quartered, depending on size
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper trimmed and minced
* ½ cup dry white wine
* ½ cup reserved pasta cooking water
* ⅓ cup fresh parsley leaves minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

InstructionsPrepare the Scallops:

* Remove the muscle from the scallops and sprinkle with salt. Put them on a plate and transfer to the refrigerator as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
* Peel and devein the shrimp and pat dry. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the refrigerator.

Start the Pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Prepare the Seafood:

* Once all of the ingredients have been chopped and diced, prepare the scallops to be sautéed. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a wide pot over high heat.
* Pat the scallops dry thoroughly once more. The dryer the better!

Cook the Scallops:

* Melt 2 tablespoons butter into the wide pot. Once melted and frothy, add the scallops and don’t move until a beautiful crust has formed, about 1 minute 30 seconds. Flip and cook an additional 30 seconds or so. The scallops should be slightly undercooked. Transfer to a plate.
* Pat the shrimp dry once more. Add them to the pot and cook in an even layer for 2-3 minutes until almost cooked through. Transfer to the plate with scallops. Loosely tent with foil as you finish the sauce.

Cook the Pasta:

* Right before beginning the sauce, add the linguine to the boiling water. Cook until al dente and reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.

Cook the Sauce:

* Carefully wipe out the excess butter from the wide pot. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the pot over medium heat. Once melted and frothy, add the finely diced shallot and fennel and cook for 4-5 minutes until softened.
* Add the tomatoes and red Fresno pepper (or crushed red pepper) and season everything with salt and pepper. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the tomatoes begin to soften.
* Turn the heat to high for 1 minute. Pour in the white wine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and boil the sauce for about 5-7 minutes until it reduces. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Finish the Sauce:

* Add the reserved pasta cooking water to the pot. Bring to a boil and cook for 3-4 minutes until reduced. Taste and season again to your preferences. Stir in the minced parsley.

Finish the Seafood Linguine:

* Add the cooked linguine to the pot and toss to coat. Add the seafood and cook for 1-2 minutes more until the shrimp are opaque and the scallops are warmed through. Turn off the heat.

To Serve:

* Divide the pasta and seafood between shallow bowls. Garnish with more parsley and fennel fronds. Enjoy!

joq65v,Easy &amp; Delicious Pesto!,1240,44,1604607408.0,0.98,Pasta,ZenRowndys,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/joq65v,"Pine nuts can be expensive, but the best thing about this recipe is you can use a variety of different nut and leafy green combinations! (The one pictured above was Walnut &amp; Kale!)

Recipe for the sauce can be found here!: https://bezeninthekitchen.com/pesto

Ingredients

2 Cups Leafy Greens (Basil, Spinach, Arugula, or Kale are best)

3/4 Cup Shredded Parmesan

1/2 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil

1/3 Cup Nuts, roasted (Pine Nuts, Walnuts, or Cashews are best)

3-4 Cloves of Garlic, minced

Kosher Salt &amp; Black Pepper, to taste

Steps

1. Roast nuts in a small pan over medium heat until golden brown and fragrant, (when you REALLY smell them, you’ll know they’re ready), remove from heat and let cool slightly.

2. In a large bowl, add your greens of choice, parmesan, roasted nuts, minced garlic, a pinch of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper and toss together lightly to combine.

3. IF USING AN IMMERSION BLENDER: Pour olive oil over the top of the ingredients in the mixing bowl and blend together with the immersion blender. Start on a lower speed setting until the ingredients have reduced in volume by at least 50%, then blend on high speed until fully combined. (Feel free to make it as smooth or as chunky as you’d like! Also, stop to clear the blade of the blender a few times as well as scrape down the sides of the bowl in the blending process, just DO NOT forget to unplug the blender first.)

4. IF USING A REGULAR BLENDER: Add the ingredients from the mixing bowl to the blender and blitz together ingredients have reduced in size and appear more or less combined. Then, add the olive oil and continue to blend until reaching your desired consistency. (Also stop to scrape down the sides of the blender, as necessary.)

5. Now, it will be ready for whatever use you want! Pasta, pizza, sandwiches, it does not matter… but if you are not using it right away, press plastic wrap on the top of the pesto and make sure there are no air pockets, then place in the fridge until ready for use, (this will protect the bright green color of the pesto, if there is too much air, the sauce will turn a sickly brown).

6. Enjoy!

Simple to make and delicate but at the same time tasty and delicious.  

Malfatti in italian means ""poorly-made"" because of the irregular shape. But don't worry the taste is superb! For the video recipe [HERE](https://youtu.be/DSieZFgoZoA)  
 

&amp;#x200B;

 **INGREDIENTS:**

*  Ricotta cheese  500 gr ( cow or sheep ricotta)

* Parmigiano or Grana cheese  40 gr   
* Boiled spinach  135 gr
*  Nutmeg 
*  Salt 
*  A spoon of extra virgin olive oil  
* Garlic clove 
*  Black Pepper 

&amp;#x200B;

 **FOR THE SEASONING**:  

*  Butter   
* Sage  
* Parmigiano or Grana cheese  

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTION**

* Take the ricotta cheese and put in a colander for 30 minutes, and let it drain off the excess liquid in the fridge  
* In a pan, put in the olive oil and the garlic clove. When the garlic starts to brown put in the spinach and the salt. Let them flavor in the oil for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally.  
* Remove the garlic and let the spinach cool.  
* Take the food processor and put all the ingredients and add a sprinkling of nutmeg, salt  and black pepper. Mix until the ingredients are well blended ( a couple of minutes are enough normally).  Leave the mixture to firm up in fridge for about 1 hour. 
*  Now with the help of two spoons shape the malfattI ( you should look the video for the technique but  don't worry they are good even if with a different shape and Malfatti in italian means ""poorly-made""  )
*  When the Malfatti comes to surface they are ready. Keep/Reserve  a half glass of the cooking water. 
*  In a pan put the butter and the sage in. Let the butter start to melt and add the cooking water. When the butter is completely melted add the malfatti and let it cook for minute with the butter.

* After a few minutes of cooking, add your spinach and continue cooking for a few more, adding small amounts of the pasta water to maintain a saucy consistency.

**FINISH IT UP**

* Once pasta is cooked, drain the remaining water and put your pasta aside. 
* After a few minutes your spinach will be cooked down and no longer look like chopped leaves, add your pasta and stir the entire lot together.

# Ingredients:

## Filling:

### Pumpkin:

500 gr pumpkin peeled in little dices

200 gr parmesan cheese + some extra to put on the top of the lasagna.

Olive oil

## Bechamel:

50 gr butter

50 gr flour

500 ml milk

## Pasta:

200 gr pasta flour type 00

2 eggs.

# Method

## Pumpkin Fillling:

Put the pumpkin in an oven plate. Mix it with two tablespoons of olive oil. Put it in a preheated oven (180°) for one hour. Let it cool down. Rasp the parmesan cheese on top of it then mix well. Season with salt and pepper.

## Bechamel:

Melt the butter in a pan but don’t let it become brown. Mix the flour with the melted butter. Let it dry a bit in the pan (until it smells like baked biscuits). Add the milk step by step while stirring. At the end you should have a consistent sauce. Let it cool down. Season with salt and pepper.

Mix the pumpkin with the bechamel.

## Pasta:

Mix the flour with the eggs. Knead the dough for 5 to 10 min. Roll it in a ball and put it in cellophane paper and in the fridge for 30 to 60 min.

Roll it out with a pasta machine and slice it in lasagna sheets. Cook each of the pasta sheet 3 min in boiling water.

## Lasagna: 

Take an oven plate and butter it. Put one sheet of lasagna, then some pumpkin sauce, then one sheet of lasagna … until the plate is full. Rasp some parmesan cheese on top of it.

Put it in a preheated oven (200°) for 20 min.

This creamy rigatoni with seared scallops is comfort-food heaven. Perfectly seared scallops nestled into a creamy, spicy sauce make for an incredible dinner!

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 40 minutes

Total Time: 55 minutes

Servings: 4

Calories: 751kcal

Author: Kylie Perrotti

# Equipment

&amp;#x200B;

* Wide Pot
* Large pot
* Medium Skillet

# Ingredients

**Spicy Rigatoni:**

* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
* 1 sweet onion peeled and sliced into thin wedges
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons capers drained
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper more or less to taste
* 1 cup white wine or chicken stock
* 1 cup chicken stock
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes quartered
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 16 ounces dry rigatoni
* 1 lemon juiced
* 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Scallops:**

* 1 pound dry-packed sea scallops muscle removed
* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Salt and pepper to taste

# Instructions

Start the Sauce:

* In a wide pot, heat the neutral cooking oil over medium heat until hot. Add the onion and cook for 5-6 minutes until just beginning to soften.
* Add the garlic, capers, and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

Deglaze the Pan:

* Add the white wine and chicken stock and bring to a boil.

Simmer the Sauce:

* Add the cherry tomatoes to the sauce and bring to a boil. Taste and season lightly with salt and pepper. The capers and chicken stock will lend a lot of salt to this recipe, so be careful with salting too heavily. Reduce heat and simmer as you prepare the rest of the meal.

Boil the Pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the rigatoni and cook for about 2-3 minutes under al dente.

Finish the Sauce:

* Pour the heavy cream into the sauce. Scoop out 1/3 cup pasta water from the rigatoni and add it to the sauce. Using a spider strainer, add the slightly undercooked rigatoni directly to the sauce. Bring to a very gentle bubble – not boiling, but slightly above a simmer. And cook for 5-7 minutes more until the sauce is very thick and the pasta is tender. Stir in the lemon juice and minced parsley. Taste and season again to your preference.

Sear the Scallops:

* Pat the scallops dry. Season lightly with salt and pepper and pat dry again.
* Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Melt the butter into the skillet. Once melted and frothy, add the scallops, without overcrowding the pan, and cook for 1-2 minutes until very well seared. Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes more until the scallops are opaque and cooked through.
* Turn off the heat on the scallops and immediately transfer the scallops on top of the pasta in the skillet. Turn off the heat.

To Serve:

* Divide the pasta and scallops between shallow bowls. Garnish with more minced parsley, if desired. Enjoy!

ilanye,Cacio e Pepe with Black Trumpet Tagliatelle,1730,30,1599065926.0,0.99,Pasta,saucesandwich_,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/ilanye,"  

Recipe as follows and a link to a short video of the process below.

**Black Trumpet Tagliatelle**

Ingredients

430 g 00 Flour

20 g dehydrated wild mushroom powder

250 g eggs (beaten before mixing)

\*Portioned for 5 - 6 people

Directions

1. Using a spice grinder (or similar) blitz your dried mushrooms into a very fine powder. Here I’m using black trumpets but you could easily substitute with any other edible wild mushroom.

2. Mix together the mushroom powder and flour into a bowl, and dump out onto your clean work surface.

3. Use your hand to form a well (like a volcano) in the center of the flour.

4. Carefully pour your eggs into the center and begin slowly mixing together with a fork. Gradually, carefully, work your way all around to incorporate the eggs with the flour, without breaking the outer wall.

5. After about 5 - 10 minutes it will start coming together into a shaggy mass. Begin using your hands to knead the dough together. Work diligently for another 5 minutes until it is no longer shaggy.

6. Use the edges of your hands, knuckles, to work the dough until it starts to form a smooth ball. Roll it, applying pressure, into the work surface. Fold it. Roll it again. After about ten minutes it should be a smooth, and ready to rest.

7. Cut the dough into two and wrap each in plastic wrap. Set into the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

8. The following steps revolve around using a pasta attachment on a Kitchenaid - but you could also do this by hand with a rolling pin. Remove one of the dough balls, unwrap, and cut off a portion of the dough. Lightly flour and cover the rest back with plastic. Press gently and form a rectangle.

9. Pass the dough through the sheet pasta attachment at it’s widest setting. If it feels sticky, add a little more flour. Gradually tighten the settings of the pasta attachment, one click at a time, and pass the pasta sheet through until it is light and delicate. For tagliatelle, I normally go to the 6th setting.

10. Allow the sheet of dough (sfoglia) to dry for 2-3 minutes and fold in half. With a knife, trim off irregular edges. Gently fold the dough into about 3 inch folds, over and over until you have a nice compact roll.

11. Using your knife, carefully begin cutting strips of the roll into about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) pieces. With your fingers, unroll each strip and sprinkle with a light coating of semolina. You can make little nests with each batch that is finished. Repeat until all of your dough has transformed unto tagliatelle.

12. Cook right away of store in the fridge covered with a towel.

**Cacio e pepe**

Ingredients

1 1/2 cups freshly grated Pecorino Romano

1 1/2 tsp. of freshly ground black pepper

3 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil

Salt

1.5 cups pasta water

Directions

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add a dash of salt.

2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and add in crushed black pepper. Stir until the pepper becomes very fragrant. Turn off the heat.

3. Boil the fresh pasta.

4. Reserve about 1.5 cups of pasta water as the pasta finishes. The starch from the water is why you wouldn’t just use regular water here.

5. Transfer the cooked pasta into the skillet with pepper and oil. Toss until all of the noodles are coated.

6. Add about a cup of pasta water to the noodles and stir. This may feel like a lot but it will all come together when you…

7. Add all of the freshly grated Pecorino to the pasta, and stir very well until the cheese and water form a luxurious creamy coating all over the noodles. Add more pasta water as necessary.

8. Divide the pasta into individual plates and sprinkle on a little more fresh Pecorino. Garnish with basil is optional.

hki2ep,Greek Pasta Salad,9,1,1593778731.0,0.82,Pasta,ebianco123,https://i.redd.it/vi050t8xwm851.jpg,"[Steps with pictures ](https://www.tastefullygrace.com/2020/07/02/greek-pasta-salad/) 

Happy Fourth of July weekend! Like me, I’m sure many of you are headed to a picnic at some point this weekend. It’s not always easy to find something to bring that’s portable, delicious, and summery. This pasta salad is all these. AND it’s quite healthy (which is a major plus when you’re already sipping beers, eating ‘dogs, chips, dips, and shoving desserts in your mouth like me!).

Get all the flavors of a yummy Greek Salad loaded with kalamata olives and feta, and combine them with whole wheat pasta in a light lemony dressing. This Greek Pasta Salad is picnic pleaser certified: my go-to summer party dish!

 

Makes: for 4 people

THE INGREDIENTS
1 pound whole wheat penne rigate

4 pickling cucumbers, cut in slices

1 heaping cup cherry tomatoes, cut long-ways and in quarters

½ cup (4 ounces) kalamata olives, pitted and halved

1 small red onion, shaved (cut into paper thin slices)

¾ cup (6 ounces) crumbled feta

24 shrimp, chilled and tails off

1 lemon, juiced

Extra virgin olive oil

1 large clove garlic, minced

Cracked black pepper

Fresh basil for garnish (optional)

 

THE STEPS
In a bowl, add cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, red onion, feta, and shrimp.

Bring water to a boil and add pasta. Cook pasta to al dente according to box instructions.

While pasta is boiling, whisk together lemon juice, garlic, olive oil and black pepper to taste. I recommend using about 1/3 parts lemon juice to 2/3 parts olive oil! Pour dressing in with the cucumbers, tomatoes, and other ingredients.

Remove pasta from boiling water and drain. Rinse pasta in cold running water to remove some excess starch and to stop the pasta from cooking.

Pour pasta in with other ingredients. With a large spoon, toss all ingredients.

Plate or store in a big bowl or Tupperware. Garnish with basil (optional). Best served at room temp!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/hki2ep/greek_pasta_salad/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/hki2ep/greek_pasta_salad/

You will get a better result if you use a microplane to grate the cheese. A microplane will produce a light fluffy grate that incorporates really well.

The trick to cacio e pepe and carbonara is to always incorporate the cheese off the heat. Peorino and Parmesan will clump if there is too much heat.

The frying pan method is good because you use less water. The only thing is that the starch level in the water is much higher than the normal method using lots of water. It is a great method but can get gummy if you are not careful.

¼ cup parmesan

¼ cup mozzarella

**Sautéed Seasoning:**

Reserve fat from the meatballs

½ medium onion (finely diced)

2 bay leaves

2 teaspoon dried basil

2 teaspoon Italian seasoning

2 cloves garlic

***Vegetable Puree:***

1 28 oz can diced tomatoes 

1 stalk celery (6-8 in long)

1 medium carrot (or 1 tsp sugar)

½ cup water

½ teaspoon salt

**Pasta:**

2 quarts water

1 tsp salt

12 oz pasta

**MEATBALLS INSTRUCTIONS:**

Heat the milk in the microwave for about 30 seconds, or until warm. Keep a close watch so it doesn’t boil over. Soak the breadcrumbs in the milk and set aside for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine the other meatball ingredients in a large mixing bowl and mix well.

Add the soaked breadcrumbs to the mixture and thoroughly combine with a spatula or your hands if necessary.

Preheat a large nonstick skillet at least 10 inches in diameter and 2 ½ inches deep on medium heat – you will use the same skillet to finish the sauce.

Form meatballs roughly 1 ½ inch in diameter using your hands and place them in the skillet. *To ensure they’re the same size, use a trigger release ice cream scoop. This recipe makes about a dozen medium-sized meatballs.*  

Cook the meatballs for approximate 10 minutes, until they hold their shapes and have browned. *Make sure to turn them gently a few times during the cooking process to ensure even browning.*

**SPAGHETTI SAUCE INSTRUCTIONS:**

Remove the meatballs once they’re done cooking but leave the fat in the skillet. *If you’re only making the sauce, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil instead.*

In the same skillet, sauté the diced onion on medium heat until lightly golden, then add the rest of the seasonings and sauté for an additional minute.

In a blender, puree the diced tomatoes, celery, and carrot. Add this puree into the skillet, then add the water and salt. Bring the sauce to a slow boil, and let it simmer with the lid on for 15 minutes. *If you’re using fresh tomatoes, increase the amount tomatoes to 32 oz and skip the ½ cup water; let this sauce simmer for 1 hour. If you’re skipping the carrot, add 1 teaspoon of sugar instead to dull the acidity of the tomatoes.*

Add the meatballs back into the skillet. Simmer with the lid on for another 30 minutes.

**PASTA INSTRUCTIONS:**

Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil, then add the salt. 

Cook the spaghetti for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the desired consistency is reached. 

Drain and add to the spaghetti sauce to serve.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/gom59j/spaghetti_and_meatballs/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/gom59j/spaghetti_and_meatballs/

As the morel  season in the northeast winds down, this was pure magic on a plate. If  morels are not readily available or in season, any fresh wild mushroom  would work nicely. [Video of the whole process (from forest to plate) is available here and the recipe is as follows](https://youtu.be/Xve1KklPNDQ)**.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Morel Cream Sauce**

Ingredients

Fresh morel mushrooms

2 -3 finely diced ramp leaves (or cloves of garlic)

1 cup of heavy cream

1/4 cup white wine

Salt and pepper

1/2 stick of butter

1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan (plus more for finishing)

Instructions

1. Clean and slice the morels into pinky sized pieces.
2. Bring a skillet to medium heat and melt the butter.
3. Sauté the mushrooms for a few minutes and add the diced ramp leaves. Sauté for another minute.
4. Add the wine and bring up to a simmer so it starts to render down.
5. Continue stirring the mushrooms and slowly add in the heavy cream. Continue stirring and bring back to a simmer.
6. Simmer for another 5 minutes or so, and add more cream (or water) to adjust if necessary.
7. Add the freshly grated parmesan cheese and continue stirring. The sauce should be thickening, creamy, and will start to smell incredible. Season with salt and black pepper after tasting. The parmesan cheese is already quite salty and you don’t want to over salt.
8. The mushrooms should be tender, and completely cooked down. The total time should take about 20 minutes.
9. Transfer your cooked pasta directly into the pan with the cream sauce. Using tongs, roll the pasta around so the sauce complete coats all of the noodles.
10. Garnish each plate with some more freshly ground black pepper and parmesan cheese.

Ingredients

350g pasta of your choice

1 cup thickened cream

100g salted butter cut into six cubes

1 lemon

1/4 - 1/2 cup pasta water

1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

500g smoked barramundi

Salt to taste 

Cracked black pepper to serve

Method

Using a peeler, peel off two strips of lemon skin and cut very finely into thin strips. Finely grate the remainder of the lemon skin and juice half of the lemon. Set this all to the side. 

In a large pot with heavily salted boiling water, cook your pasta al dente. Follow the cooking instructions on the back of the pasta packet. While your pasta is cooking begin to make the sauce. 

In a large pot on a low heat, add your cream and lemon zest and bring to the simmer while stirring quite frequently with a whisk. To ensure you emulsify the butter and cream, add one cube of butter into the cream and whisk through until it is fully melted and combined with the cream. Repeat this step 5 times until all the butter is mixed through. Take your sauce off the heat. 

Reserve 1/4 - 1/2 cup pasta water and drain your pasta. Add your pasta into the sauce with the pasta water and stir through on a low - medium heat for several minutes. Start with 1/4 cup pasta water and add more in if your sauce is too thick. Add your fish, cheese, lemon juice and salt to taste and continue to stir through for 1 - 2  minutes or until everything is well combined. You should have a smooth and silky sauce.

## Ingredients 

### For the lobster bisque 

* 50g unsalted butter 
* 1/2 bunch of spring onion stalks roughly chopped 
* 1/2 cup white wine 
* 1kg fresh lobster cut in half (ask your fishmonger to do this for you) 
* Pinch of salt and pepper 
* 1 tablespoon olive oil 

### For the mac n cheese

* 1kg cooked lobster meat that was used to make the bisque 
* 100g unsalted butter 
* 4 crushed garlic cloves 
* 50g plain white flour 
* 3 cups full fat milk
* 100g grated gruyere or white cheddar
* 50g grated parmeson 
* 300g macaroni pasta 
* 1 tablespoon olive oil 
* Pinch of salt and pepper 

## Method

### Lobster bisque 

* In a large pot on a low to medium heat, combine all ingredients. Pop the lid on your pot and leave to simmer and steam for 10 minutes until the lobster meat is cooked and the shell has turned pink. Make sure you do not clean your lobster as you want all of the flavour to go into your bisque. 
* Take your lobster out of the pot and set to the side. Through a mesh strainer, drain your bisque into a separate bowl and set to the side. 

### Mac n cheese

* Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius. 
* In a large pot with heavily salted water, cook your pasta following the pasta instructions on the back of the packet. 
* Remove the meat from your lobster shell and roughly chop. 
* In a large fry pan or wok on a medium heat, melt the butter. Add the olive oil and crushed garlic and cook for 3 minutes making sure you stir occasionally so the garlic does not burn. 
* Add the flour to your pan and cook for several minutes stirring quite consistently with a whisk until a paste like texture forms. Add in your milk one cup at a time, stirring until smooth. Once all your milk is added, leave to simmer for 3 minutes until your sauce has thickened and is at a consistency you like. You can add more milk if needed. 
* On a low heat, stir the drained pasta, half of the cheese and lobster through your sauce. Spoon your mac n cheese into your baking dish and sprinkle the remainder of the cheese on top. Pop into the oven for 20 minutes. 
* Serve immediately with your lobster bisque on the side.

ftnwp2,Pan Fried Gnocchi with Wild Ramp Pesto,200,5,1585839977.0,1.0,Pasta,saucesandwich_,https://i.redd.it/zbu5u2iu6fq41.jpg,"It’s still a bit early in the season so most ramps are too young to harvest. With a little effort we found a more mature patch along a sunny south eastern facing ridge. We harvested just enough leaves for a small batch of pesto and left the bulbs in the ground. For the pesto I kept it super simple. Ramps, pistachios, olive oil, and salt blitz in the food processor and served on top of pan fried gnocchi (in lots of butter) and some freshly grated Parmesan and ground pepper. It’s a once a year kind of meal. 

If harvesting ramps, don’t yank the bulbs, don’t raze entire hillsides, don’t take more than you need. They take seven years to reach maturity. 

[Recipe is as follows, and here's a short video of the entire process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kcXlAPDPCQ)

&amp;#x200B;

**Gnocchi Ingredients**

2½ pounds russet potatoes (about 4 large)

1¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting

2 teaspoons kosher salt

1 egg

Butter 

**Instructions**

1. Boil potatoes for 35 - 45 minutes until fork tender.
2. Drain and allow to cool so you can handle them but they need to still be warm for the next step. If allowed to cool they’ll become gummy.
3. Peel the potatoes with your fingers or by using the edge of a spoon. Cut up the potatoes into small chunks.
4. Press all of the warm potatoes through a potato ricer into a large bowl. 
5. Sprinkle on the flour and salt, and work together with your hands for about 30 seconds. Make a well in the center of the bowl and pour in the egg, which should already be beaten. 
6. Mix together with your hands for another 30 seconds. 
7. Pour out the contents of the bowl onto a well dusted work surface and continue to knead together for another 1 - 2 minutes. An important note is to not overwork this dough. The more you work it, the denser the gnocchi will be. 
8. Divide the dough into about 4 - 6 different balls and dust each with more flour. 
9. Begin rolling each ball out with your hands to create a long rope of rough about ¾ inch thick. Use more flour if it feels like the dough is sticky. And again, don’t overwork!
10. Using a knife or bench knife, cut each rope into approximately 1 inch pieces. 
11. You could stop here, and transfer them to a tray dusted with semolina to prevent sticking. 
12. Or you can continue with embellishing them a bit by using the tines of a fork to create the classic dimples and grooves you might often see. Carefully take each individual piece in your fingers, and with your other hand press the tip of your fork into the center of the gnocchi, and roll it gently to form the grooves. Now you can set it into your tray with semolina until ready to cook.
13. Bring a big pot of water to boil. Cook the gnocchi for about 4 minutes until they float to the surface. Drain the gnocchi. 
14. In a heavy skillet, melt butter and bring up to medium/high heat. 
15. Transfer the boiled gnocchi into the hot pan and allow to crisp for about 3 minutes on each side. They’ll start to turn golden brown and form a nice texture on the shell, while the interior stays light and fluffy.
16. Now toss the pan fried gnocchi with the pesto. Plate each portion and top generously with freshly grated parmesan and black pepper. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Pesto Ingredients**

¼ cup of pistachios

½ cup olive oil

Sprinkle of salt

Two handfuls of washed ramp leaves

Grated parmesan (optional)

**Instructions**

1. Shell the pistachios and blitz in the blender
2. Add all of the other ingredients and blend until smooth 
3. Add more olive oil if pesto is too thick

Ingredients 

500g Italian pork sausages

500g chorizo pork sausages 

6 tablespoons olive oil

1 white onion diced

2 garlic cloves crushed

1 tablespoon tomato paste

2 x 700g passata 

2 tablespoons brown sugar

Salt and pepper to taste

1/2 lemon

1/2 cup water

1 red chilli (optional)

500g pasta of your choice

Method

Remove the meat from the sausage casing. This can be done by using your hands and squeezing it out through the ends. In a large pot with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, fry your sausage meat for five minutes on a medium heat breaking it down with a wooden spoon so it is more mince like and less chunky. Take the sausage meat out of the pot and set to the side. Don’t worry if it’s not cooked all the way through as it will continue to cook when we simmer it in the sauce. 

In the same pot, add 4 tablespoons olive oil and the onion and stir for 5 minutes until fragrant and soft. Add in the garlic and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add in the tomato paste and stir through for 30 seconds then add the passata, sugar, lemon juice and salt and pepper. I like to add a splash of water into my passata bottles and swirl it around to ensure I am getting everything out of the bottle. I then throw this into the pot. It equals to roughly 1/2 cup water. 

Add the sausage meat into the pot with the sauce and leave to simmer on a low heat for 45 minutes. 

In a large pot with heavily salted boiling water, cook your pasta el dente. Follow the cooking instructions on the back of the pasta packet.

fhsmyh,"A delicious lovechild of some of my favorite Italian pasta dishes! Basically equal parts Cacio e Pepe, Aglio e Olio and traditional Alfredo.",10,4,1584067102.0,1.0,Pasta,Andrewriley12,https://i.redd.it/87s2ydj9rcm41.jpg,"Cheesy Peppery Pasta Sauce Thing

Is it Carbonara? Is it Cacio e Pepe? Is it Alfredo? Is it Aglio e Olio? Yes. It’s all of these things and none of them at the same time. I’m losing my mind. Send help. 

Recipe for 2 adult servings. 
Possible substitutions listed below recipe. 

Ingredients:
8 oz (1/2 of a normal package) of pasta. My preference is fettuccine or other long flat noodle. 
3 garlic cloves, finely minced or crushed
1 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano or Pecorino Romano (plus more to garnish)
2 Tbsp butter
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 tsp coarse ground black pepper (plus more to garnish)
1 tsp sodium citrate
3/4 cup pasta cooking water (see recipe)

Directions:
Fill a pot with ~6 cups of water and bring to a boil. Add the noodles to the water (with all the sodium in the sauce from the cheese and sodium citrate there’s no need to salt the water) and set timer for box recommendations for al dente (usually 7 minutes in my experience). If your noodles are especially long it will seem like they can’t fit, but after 30 seconds the noodles will start to fall as they re-constitute. By the one minute mark noodles should be fully submerged. If not, gently push noodles down.

Add butter and olive oil to a large skillet over medium heat. Once butter is melted, add garlic and cook, stirring dutifully, until garlic has lightly browned. Remove skillet from heat and incorporate black pepper. 

When noodles are done cooking, use a pyrex measuring cup to take out 3/4 of a cup of the pasta water and set to the side (The starches from this water, in addition to the sodium citrate, will help the sauce come together and achieve the right consistency). Drain the noodles but do not rinse. Set aside. 

Add the reserved pasta water to the skillet with the butter, oil, garlic and pepper. Slowly add the cheese, stirring vigorously until cheese has melted but sauce still hasn’t come together. Add the sodium citrate and stir for another 2 minutes until sauce is creamy and silky smooth. 

Add pasta to skillet and toss in the sauce (😎) to incorporate fully; et voila! 

To serve:
Use a carving fork with a twisting motion to assemble a delicate bird’s nest of pasta on a plate if you’re taking pics for the gram. If you’re a normal person, just take some tongs or a spaghetti serving spoon and put a pile on a plate. Top with extra black pepper and grated cheese. Eat with a fork, or your hands if you’re feeling frisky. 

Substitutions/Alterations: 
You can substitute goat butter or clarified butter (ghee) for standard butter if you have issues with lactose. Also be sure to use Pecorino instead of Parmigiano.

Gluten free pasta is totally acceptable and will not negatively affect the sauce in my experience. 

Feel free to use any hard, aged cheese you may already have instead of the Pecorino/Parmigiano. Asiago comes to mind. I have this aged manchego in the fridge that’s definitely going to end up in this the next time I make it. 

Feel free to use less pepper, especially if serving to children. You can always add more as you serve.

If making this for a larger family, you can basically double everything in the recipe. When doubled, this recipe will easily feed two adults and two kids plus leftovers.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fhsmyh/a_delicious_lovechild_of_some_of_my_favorite/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fhsmyh/a_delicious_lovechild_of_some_of_my_favorite/

https://www.chefsteps.com/activities/droolworthy-calabrian-sausage-ragu-and-homemade-capunti-with-jason-stoneburner

Ingredients
* 500 g ground pork
* 10 g smoked paprika (sweet)
* 10 g sea salt
* 4 g Calabrian chili, dried and ground (or 2g chili flakes)
* 3 g fennel seed, whole
* 15 g olive oil (1 tbsp) 
* 150 g white wine
* 200 g tomato juice
* 240 g chicken stock
* 400 g chicken stock
* 40 g butter
* 2 g Marjoram
* Salt, as needed
* Black pepper, as needed
* 20 g Pecorino
Directions
1. Season the ground pork with the paprika, salt, chili, and fennel. Mix gently to keep that meat looking like sausage instead of meat paste.
2. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat and lightly brown the sausage mixture. Take care not to break up the sausage too much. 
3. Once the meat is mostly brown, add the wine to deglaze, and scrape the bits of good, crispy meat from the bottom of the pot. Turn the heat down and let simmer until the wine is heavily reduced and the pan is almost dry. 
4. Add the tomato juice and let it reduce by half.
5. Add the stock and continue to simmer until the sauce is reduced by half again. 
6. Finally, add the tomato sauce and simmer until you have achieved “ragù consistency”: the liquid will stick to the back of a spoon but still pool just a little bit on a plate.
7. Add butter and marjoram leaves to the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper if needed.

Note: If using dried pasta put it in boiling when adding the stock. If using fresh pasta cook it shortly before the sauce is finished. For fresh pasta I use 500g Italian type 00 flour, 250g of eggs (around 4) + 2 egg yolks and a little bit of water (if needed to get a nice, smooth consistency)",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/f5fts2/calabrian_sausage_ragù/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/f5fts2/calabrian_sausage_ragù/

ricotta cheese, full fat 250 g
*   
**TO SERVE**   
rocket / arugula 100 g  
lemon 1/2 medium 

**Directions:**

*  *PREP* \- chop the onions, mince the garlic.  

* *PASTA* \- bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook according to package directions until al dente (still a little firm). Drain + toss with a little olive oil to prevent sticking while you make the sauce (or you can rinse it instead). Meanwhile... .  
SAUSAGE - while the water is coming to a boil, heat some oil in a large pan over med-high. Squeeze the sausage out of its casing into the hot pan in small blobs. Break up any large chunks as it cooks. Don't stir too much (so it browns instead of steams). Add a pinch of salt.  

* *SAUTE* \- once the meat has mostly browned, add the onions + saute until translucent and starting to caramelize, \~5 mins. Add the garlic, seasonings + saute for a minute.  

* *SIMMER* \- stir in the tomato sauce + bring it to a simmer. Add chopped basil (save a bit for topping the ziti at the end)  

* *PREHEAT* \- turn oven to 175C / 350  

* *LAYER* \- grate the mozzarella + parm. Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a casserole pan, then dot the surface with some ricotta (use a spoon to make little blobs). Place in a bowl (or the pot you cooked it in) with a ladle of the meat sauce, stir well then add to the casserole.  

* Pour the remaining sauce over the pasta, dot the rest of the ricotta on top, followed by the mozzarella + parm to finish.  

* *BAKE* \- place in the oven for \~20 mins, until the cheese is melted + golden.  

* *SERVE* \- while the ziti bakes, make a simple salad of (rinsed) rocket, lemon juice, oil + a generous pinch of s+p.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/esm8ia/easy_baked_ziti/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/esm8ia/easy_baked_ziti/

400g pasta   (Short pasta such as penne, mezze penne, maccheroncini is preferable)    
1 small onion finely minced/grated     
250g canned crushed tomatoes    
200g diced bacon    
200g cooking cream/heavy cream    
Olive oil, salt, black pepper, Parmesan.   

Directions    

In a pan cook the bacon until crispy. Once the bacon is done, take it out but leave the bacon grease. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and then add the finely minced onion and sauté it gently. Once cooked add the canned crushed tomatoes and the bacon and let it cook covered for 15-20 min on low heat. Stir it occasionally and add a pinch of salt if necessary.    

Cook the pasta in boiling salted water. Drain the pasta al dente and put it directly in the sauce, add the cooking cream, some parmesan and pepper, stir it a couple of times and then serve it.    

Note:    
 
Cooking cream can be added/removed according to your taste. If you add more you need more salt since cooking cream tends to mitigate the saltiness of the bacon, if instead you decide to use less cream be mindful with salt. Also remember there is the Parmesan, so just make sure to taste it before serving.    
You can also add chili flakes.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/dx9zoc/pasta_al_fumè/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/dx9zoc/pasta_al_fumè/

Courtesy of [Smitten Kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/02/spaghetti-pangrattato-with-fried-eggs/) 


**Crumbs**

- 2 tablespoon olive oil
- 1  large or 2 small garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
- Salt and red pepper flakes, to taste
- 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, minced
- Few fine gratings fresh lemon zest


**Crispy Egg**

- 1 glug of olive oil per egg
- 3 eggs
- Salt and pepper


**Pasta and Assembly**

- 8 ounces dried spaghetti
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 teaspoons small capers, drained (rinsed if salted), chopped
- Handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped
- 1/3 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese (optional)


**Make crispy crumbs (pangrattato)**:  Heat olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add garlic and let sizzle for barely a minute, just until it begins to turn a pale golden color. Add breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, rosemary and lemon zest and reduce heat to low, cooking mixture slowly until all of the crumbs are an even golden color, about 5 minutes. Set aside.

**Cook pasta**: Bring a large pot of well salted water to a generous boil and cook pasta until al dente about 1 to 2 minutes shy of package directions. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta cooking water before draining pasta.

**Meanwhile, make crispy eggs**: Wipe out breadcrumbs skillet. Return to stove over high heat and add a generous glug of olive oil per egg. Once hot enough that the oil begins to smoke, add egg(s). They’re going to hiss and splatter so step back as soon as you do. Spoon some of the cooking oil over the eggs, carefully. Season with salt and pepper. In 1 to 2 minutes, the egg(s) will be brown and very crisp underneath and around the edges. Shimmy a thin spatula underneath the egg(s) (a flexible fish spatula works great here), being careful not to break the yolk. If you’re cooking for someone who shouldn’t be eating runny yolks (ahem), you can flip the egg over and cook it for another 30 seconds or so before removing it. Transfer cooked egg(s) to paper towels to drain.

**Assemble dish**: Once pasta is drained, return it to the empty pot or a large skillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a splash or two (or all, if needed to loosen pasta) of reserved cooking water. Over high heat, toss with capers and parsley for 1 minute. Divide among bowls or plates. Sprinkle with Pecorino, if using, then 1/3 of breadcrumb (pangrattato) mixture. Place an egg over each dish, and break up with a fork. Eat immediately.

**my edits**
- I do not use lemon zest or rosemary in the bread crumbs, and I just use seasoned crumbs.

- just make a normal over easy fried egg.  Each time I’ve tried to get them crispy the overcook, and you need the yolk runny

- I also used my non-stick pan for the fried egg.  Just easier.

Ingredients:


-1 pkg Boars Head diced uncured pancetta (diced bacon would work too) 

- 1 shallot

- 1/2 lb Brussels sprouts, shaved

- 1 small carnival squash (your fave squash would do) 

- 1 small pkg frozen peas

- sage

- Italian parsley

- optional: smashed pecan or walnut pieces, or pumpkin seeds 

- 1/2 lb Orechiette pasta

- 2 tbsp butter

- 1 egg

- 1 cup fresh grated Parmigiano reggiano


Instructions:


1) preheat oven to 400 F. Thinly slice Brussels sprouts from top to stem, discarding tough core (I couldn't find shaved sprouts, and I don't own a mandoline). Peel squash and dice into 1/2 inch pieces. Toss squash and sprouts in a little oil, salt, and pepper; spread on baking tray. Roast for fifteen minutes, turning squash around minute seven.


2) set well-salted water to boil for pasta. Preheat a large flat-bottom pan over medium-high heat and add pancetta. Cook, turning infrequently, until pancetta is crispy and fat is rendered, around 5-7 min. Take pancetta from pan and place in paper towel. You may wipe the pan if you prefer (though I like the pancetta fat flavor myself!)


3) dice the shallot and add to pancetta fat in pan over medium heat. Roughly chop sage and add to pan, together with nut pieces, if using. Add the butter. Once the butter begins to brown, add the frozen peas so they thaw gently. Add the roasted veg and combine in sage-butter sauce. Turn heat off and set aside.


4) cook pasta according to package directions. While pasta cooks, break egg into small bowl and whisk with fork. Once pasta is done, reserve around 1 cup of pasta water and add pasta to veggies. Slowly drizzle a bit of pasta water into egg while continuously whisking. 


5) Once egg is tempered, combine with around 1/2 cup of pasta water. Whisk in as much parmesan as you like (add more water if it gets too thick) and add to veggie/pasta mix. Turn to combine veg and pasta w sauce. Thin with pasta water until sauce is your preferred consistency.

* 3tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* 1lb pancetta or bacon lardons
* 3 cloves minced garlic
* 2 cured egg yolks
* 5oz pecorino romano
* 1 duck egg
* 3 egg yolks (duck or chicken)
* 4oz salted butter
* Cracked black pepper

Mix the duck egg, egg yolks, grated cured egg yolks, grated pecorino romano, and a good lot of freshly cracked pepper (perhaps a tablespoon or so) in a large bowl and set aside.

Parcook the pasta (about 3-5 minutes) in heavily salted water. Heat a large sauce pan (or cast iron skillet) over a medium flame and add olive oil. Turn the flame up a touch and add the lardons and garlic. 

Add the parcooked pasta along with the salted butter (it helps to slice it up first before adding) and a cup of pasta water. Toss around until evenly coated and somewhat reduced (about another 3-5 minutes).

Cut the flame and gently fold in the egg mixture. Keep the pasta moving as not to scramble the eggs. If you need to, especially if using a cast iron skillet, let the pasta sit and reduce some more and cool down beforehand.

Serve on a heated dish with grated cured egg yolk and more cracked black pepper. Good luck pairing a wine, because eggs are very hard to pair. (I'm open to suggestions if anyone has any!)

**Cured egg yolks :**

* 1.5lbs kosher salt
* 1lb white sugar
* 12 egg yolks

In a blender or food processor, pulse the salt and sugar together to evenly distribute and even-out in size. Pour into a deep pyrex tray.

Separate the yolks from the whites. Do your best to also remove the chalazae (the stringy white threads attached to the yolk). There should be no remaining white attached. Gently place into the tray about an inch and a half away from each other. Cover each yolk with the surrounding salt mixture until it does not shine through.

Cover tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for one week (you can do longer if you like, it doesn't hurt).

After a week, rinse each yolk off very well and place onto a baking sheet. Bake at 200°F for about 20 minutes. Check in on them every so often so they don't cook. We're drying them out, not roasting them.

Let cool and use as needed. Store in a dry container in the refrigerator.

**Pasta :**

* 3lbs all purpose flour (or 2lbs all purpose flour and 1lb semolina flour)
* 6 eggs and 3 egg yolks
* 1 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1/3 cup kosher salt

Spread a heavy layer of all purpose flour out onto a large, clean, flat surface. Form a doughnut of the flour mixture, and in the center add the eggs, yolks, olive oil, and salt. Beat the egg mixture, grabbing flour as you go. When it becomes too doughy to beat, knead with floured hands (but don't overwork!).

Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough out evenly until it is close to translucent. If this proves too difficult, thicker noodles are okay too. Keep the surface, top of the dough, and rolling pin heavily floured to prevent sticking.

Cut off rough edges so that your dough is a perfect rectangle. Cut 1cm thick strips.

## Grade:

Serves: 4-5

Cost: $5.42 per serving

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 35-40 minutes

## Ingredients Tomato-Basil Pasta with Walnut Gremolata

**Walnut Gremolata:**

1/2 cup unsalted walnuts

1/2 cup fresh parsley, minced

Zest of 1 lemon

1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated

Salt and pepper to taste

**Tomato-Basil Pasta:**

1 yellow onion, peeled and finely diced

2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil

4 tablespoons butter

1 and 1/2 pounds ripe Roma tomatoes (red, gold, or a mix), quartered

2 teaspoons crushed red pepper

16 ounces pasta of your choice (we used rigatoni), 3/4 cup pasta cooking water reserved

Juice of 1 lemon

1 cup basil leaves, torn

Salt and pepper to taste

## Method

## Cook the Pasta:

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente and reserve 3/4 cup pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta and set aside.

## Prepare the Walnut Gremolata:

Add the walnuts to a large skillet and turn the heat to medium. Cook, turning often, for 1-2 minutes or until the walnuts are well toasted. Transfer the walnuts to a mortar and pestle, food processor, or zip lock bag and mash or pulse until finely chopped.

In a bowl, combine the walnuts, lemon zest, minced parsley, and parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper.

## Start the Tomato-Basil Sauce:

In the same pan used to toast the walnuts, heat the neutral cooking oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 6-7 minutes until translucent and softened.

Add the butter to the pan. Once it is melted and frothy, add the tomatoes and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook without moving for 4-6 minutes, adjusting the heat if necessary, until the tomatoes begin to char and soften. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper.

## Finish the Tomato-Basil Sauce:

Pour the reserved pasta cooking water into the pan and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Bring to a low boil and keep the liquid at a slow and steady boil for 4-5 minutes until the broth is reduced and thickened.

Stir in the torn basil leaves and the lemon juice. Taste and season the sauce to your preferences and reduce heat to low.

## Sauce the Pasta:

Add the pasta to the pan and toss to coat with the sauce. Once the pasta is glossy and well-coated, turn off the heat.

## To Serve:

Divide the cooked tomato-basil pasta between shallow pasta bowls and pile the walnut gremolata on top. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/d5j2r0/tomatobasil_pasta_with_walnut_gremolata/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/d5j2r0/tomatobasil_pasta_with_walnut_gremolata/

cw6hgq,Spaghetti alla Nerano,828,13,1566921818.0,0.98,Pasta,PossiblyAgree,https://i.redd.it/xghe5ebdl0j31.png,"A couple of years ago me and my family visited the village of Nerano in Italy and had pasta alla nerano there. We’ve been in love with it ever since but haven’t really been able to recreate it the way we remember it since then. This week I finally came the closest we’ve ever been to how it was when we were served the dish by our hostess. What really made the taste stand out was using provolone piccante instead of parmesan, which is easier to find. I haven’t seen any recipes for it on reddit yet so I thought it might be nice to share it here.

# Ingredients

3 or 4 zucchini (around 800 grams)

500 grams of spaghetti

2 or 3 cloves of garlic, minced

200 grams of provolone (piccante, or if you can find it provolone de monaco), grated

# Instructions

1. Slice all the zucchini. For the sauce itself, slice the majority of the zucchini in circles, about 5 mm thick. For extra sauted zucchini, slice however you like them. They are basically a side dish and can be round, strips, donut form, whatever you prefer.
2. Saute all of the zucchini. Do this until they are tender and slightly but not completely brown, except the ones for the side dish. Saute these until they are how you prefer to eat them. Keep the ones for the side dish separate from the rest.
3. Boil the pasta. Keep the pasta water.
4. While boiling pasta, saute the minced garlic in olive oil.
5. Add the pasta to the garlic and stir them around to mix.
6. If you want to, you can blend a small part (about 1/4th) of the zucchini and add it as sauce. My friend and me kept all the zucchini in tact and just put them under the pasta. Add salt and pepper to the zucchini. Either blend zucchini and add the paste and the rest of the zucchini to the pasta or add all the zucchini (again except for the ones as side dish) under the pasta.
7. Start adding the cheese under the pasta. Add in a little bit of the pasta water as well until the pasta is coated in a paste that is the consistency you like. It may not be too watery or too dry. Make sure to season well to taste. The zucchini should slightly melt away.
8. Serve as soon as possible, while still hot. Top with the zucchini you set aside and some extra provolone.

cqn0ff,Cacio e Pepe (Cheese &amp; Pepper Pasta) with Cured Egg Yolk on Top!,1178,82,1565857052.0,0.96,Pasta,ButtaChicken,https://i.redd.it/ktnwmerfnkg31.jpg,"**Ingredients**

 • Spaghetti

 • Pecorino Cheese 

 • Parmesan Cheese

 • Black Pepper

 • Egg

 • Soy Sauce 


**Directions**

 • Grate some Pecorino Cheese and set aside. You'll need a handful of grated Pecorino for each serving.

 • Fill a pot with water and salt the water until it is almost as salty as the sea. Cook the pasta in this water until 'al dente'. Drain, but reserve the pasta water. 

 • Now, crack an egg open and separate the yolk from the white (you only need the yolk). IMPORTANT: use a VERY good quality free range or organic egg. Place the yolk in a small bowl and place about 4 tablespoons of soy sauce in the bowl, and place in the fridge. This will ""cure"" your egg yolk. If you leave it long enough, the yolk will firm up to the point where it seems almost as though it has been partially boiled. We need it runny though. 

 • Place a pan on medium heat and add a few ladels of the pasta water (this will be the base of your sauce, so use as much as you need for the amount of pasta you will cook). Let it come to a simmer, then add the grated Pecorino cheese and mix. The cheese won't fully melt and will coagulate and look rather unpleasant, but soldier on. 

 • Add the cooked pasta to the pan, and keep mixing everything up until the pasta water has reduced, and the cheese has fully melted into the pasta. Grind quite a bit of black pepper into the pan, then mix and fold into the pasta. You should be left with a creamy, cheesy light coating of sauce. 

 • Plate the pasta. Scoop the egg yolk you left in the fridge out of the soy sauce, and carefully place on top of the pasta.

 • Grate some parmesan on top if you wish.

ENJOY!

This summer pasta with squash blossoms and heirloom tomatoes is the best late summer dinner and is chock full of our favorite summery ingredients.

Squash blossoms cook incredibly fast, so you want to make sure your sauce is nearly ready to plate when you add them. Don’t overcook them.

If you cannot find squash blossoms, simply omit from the recipe.

### Grade

Serves: 4

Cost: $

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: About 25-30 minutes

### Ingredients for Summer Pasta with Squash Blossoms and Heirloom Tomatoes

1 tablespoon cooking oil

16 ounces thin spaghetti, 1/4 cup pasta cooking water reserved

1 onion, peeled and diced

4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

3 tablespoons butter

1 pound heirloom tomatoes, core removed, and quartered

1/2 cup chicken or vegetable stock

5 squash blossoms

1 small bunch basil, leaves picked from the stems

A splash or two of heavy cream, optional

Salt, pepper and crushed red pepper

For Serving

Grated parmesan cheese

Extra virgin olive oil

### Method

###### Cook the Pasta:

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until al dente and drain, reserving 1/4 cup pasta cooking water. Set aside.

###### Add the Tomatoes:

Melt the butter into the onions and garlic and season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Add the heirloom tomatoes and cook without moving for 5 minutes.

Add the stock and bring to a boil. Continue boiling for 3-5 minutes until reduced slightly.

###### Cook the Squash Blossoms:

Add the reserved pasta cooking water and the squash blossoms and basil leaves, tearing the basil leaves right before adding, and toss to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes or until the blossoms and basil leaves just begin to wilt.

###### Finish the Sauce:

Add a splash or two of heavy cream, if desired, and taste and season with salt and pepper once more.

Add the cooked spaghetti and quickly toss to combine with the sauce and vegetables, being careful not to overcook the squash blossoms.

###### To Serve:

Divide the pasta between shallow pasta bowls and serve with fresh basil leaves, a sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese, and a drizzle of oil, if desired.

1 1/2 cups of pastry flour

1 1/2 cups of semolina flour

4 eggs

Sauce

1 Tbs of Olive oil

3 medium garlic cloves

1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes

1/2 tsp dried basil

1 can of San Marzano tomatoes (crushed by hand or blend 3/4 of it in a blender for a smoother sauce)

few tablespoons of tomato paste

about half a stick of butter

1/2 cup of cream

salt and pepper to taste

parmesan cheese

Mix together the pastry flour and semolina flour in a bowl or on a large cutting board by hand for funsies (: then make a large well in the middle and add the eggs and beat them with a fork, while slowly incorporating the flour. Continue doing this until you've mixed the flour and eggs enough and start kneading by hand. \*important\* knead the dough for at least ten minutes and you'll notice the dough becomes supple and smooth. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for half an hour. Meanwhile, heat a pan and add olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, and dried basil. Cook at a low/medium heat to really draw out the flavor of the garlic and the dried herbs (about 3 minutes). Add the tomato paste and cook for about another 4 -5 minutes while mixing often so it doesn't burn. (This cooks out that metallic flavor- it'll become slightly darker in color). Add the tomatoes prepped at your favorite consistency, and cook for at least an hour. While the sauce is developing all of it's yummy flavors, you can take the pasta dough and cut it in half and begin rolling it out with a pasta maker or rolling pin. Cut the pasta into noodles and get water boiling with lots of salt. (as salty as the sea!) Go ahead and add the butter and cream to the tomato sauce and let it cook for another 10 - 15 minutes, tasting to see if there is enough salt and pepper. Add parmesan cheese at this point as well if you want to impart more flavor!

Cook the pasta in the boiling water for about 3 - 4 minutes, drain, then toss with sauce and garnish with some more parmesan cheese.

* **500ml pure cream**
* **50g butter**
* **Salt**
* **Black pepper**
* **Pasta (I used Fettuccine)**

akzop7,"Easy, simple lasagna recipe",8,2,1548766151.0,1.0,Pasta,everything_by_pasha,https://imgur.com/gallery/g5BBmWH,"Comrades, I decided to make lasagna. For some reason, I was under impression that lasagna was difficult to make (probably because I failed to create edible lasagna in the past) but I decided to give it one more try, and since then I love making it because it is simple and delicious.

I made kind of fun video of cooking it which can explain process bit more here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H4qt02rgQ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H4qt02rgQ0)

**Ingredients:**

* 0.5kg/1.1 pound ground beef and pork (each).
* ricotta, mozarella and parmezan cheese (quantity depend on how cheesy you want it to be. I used 4 big mozarella balls, 300gr/10.5 ounce of ricotta and about 200gr/7 ounce of parmezan)
* 2 onions
* 2 carrots
* lasagna sheets or fresh pasta
* 2 cans of crushed tomatoes (in my case, this is about 300gr/10.5 ounce per can)
* some celery (I hate celery, so I use 2 stalks only)
* basil
* red wine
* garlic, salt, pepper, oil and bay leaf

**Directions:**

1. I always start by preparing all vegetables.  
Cut onions into small pieces.  
Cut carrots into quarters.  
I cut celery into very big pieces so I can take them out later. If you like celery, you can cut it into small pieces.
2. Add a little oil to a pot and add your ground meat. We are rendering the fat.
3. Once meat is gray in color, turn off heat and drain the liquids into container, we will use this later.
4. With a bit of fat still in pot, add your onion, carrot, celery and squeeze two or three cloves of garlic through squeezer.
5. Fry vegetables until they give nice smell and create fond on bottom of the pot.
6. Add about 200ml/6.7 ounces (i honestly never measure) red wine to the pot and scrub bottom to deglaze.
7. Allow wine to boil for a bit to evaporate alcohol, and add back your meat to pot.
8. Add the liquid from the meat, two cans of crushed tomatoes and a little bit of water to the pot (I usually add enough to clean the can of the tomatoes). You can also add chicken or beef broth if you have.
9. Add basil, 2  teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon sugar and a bit of ground pepper. (you can also add some chilli flakes or oil to make sauce bit more spicy)
10. Let this boil with closed lid, then open lid and let pot simmer for half hour.
11. **Make sure to taste the sauce.**
12. Optional - take out celery from the sauce.

**Assembly:**

1. Put layer of sauce on bottom of your dish.
2. Put 1 layer of your sheets of lasagna on top.
3. Put layer of sauce on top of the lasagna sheets.
4. Put a mixture of your cheeses (tear mozarella balls into smaller pieces, ricotta with a spoon and shredded parmezan).
5. Repeat step 2 - 4 until you are out of sauce.
6. Make sure (I did not have enough cheese when I did this) to have a bunch of shredded parmezan on top of the lasagna, so it forms a ""lid"" when it melts.
7. Shove this into preheated oven at 180C/356F for 40 minutes.

**Important -** Let lasagna rest a bit when you take it out of the oven before you serve.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/akzop7/easy_simple_lasagna_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/akzop7/easy_simple_lasagna_recipe/

&amp;#x200B;

Vodka Sauce:

1/2 yellow onion

3 - 4 medium to large cloves of garlic (1 or 2 extra if you're a garlic fiend like myself)

32 ounces of canned crushed tomatoes (this time I actually bought Italian plum tomatoes and crushed them by hand and added half the mixture to a blender for a smoother consistency)

2 Tbs of tomato paste

1/3 cup of vodka

about 1 cup of heavy cream

1/2 cup of parmesan cheese

1 stick of butter

1 tsp of good Italian seasoning

1 tsp of red pepper flakes

salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

&amp;#x200B;

This recipe has a smoother consistency because the onions and garlic are blended up instead of chopped. Also, I usually use rigatoni pasta for this sauce, but found this paccheri and its ABSOLUTELY perfect for this sauce. So delicious.

&amp;#x200B;

Quarter the onion and peel and roughly crush the garlic and add it to a blender with about a 1/3 cup of water and blend until smooth. Add mixture to a heated pot with some olive oil. Cook until excess water has mostly evaporated (Warning: Your kitchen is going to have some strong odors during this step!). Then add the vodka and cook for about another 5 minutes to evaporate the alcohol. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, and taste for seasoning before cooking it on medium low for about an hour and 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. The taste will develop over this time and round out nicely. Add the butter, stir until melted. Then add the heavy cream and parmesan while stirring and bring to gentle simmer- seasoning again with salt and pepper if necessary. Let the flavors meld together at a low simmer for about 15 - 20 minutes. Serve sauce over a tube shaped pasta of your choice - enjoy!

2 vidalia onions  

4 stalks of celery  

4 carrots  

3 8-ounce containers of Baby Bella mushrooms  

3 tablespoons dry porcini mushrooms  

2 tablespoons miso  

1 8-ounce can of tomato paste  

4 tbs soy sauce

2 28-ounce cans of San Marzano tomatoes

1 bundle of rosemary, sage, and thyme secured with twine  

14 cloves of garlic  

2 cups dry, red wine  

salt  

pepper  

cayenne  

 

_____________________________________________________________

Directions  

Two hours before you begin cooking, soak the dried porcini mushrooms in half a cup of warm water.  

Dice the vidalia onions and set them aside. After, chop your celery and carrots (I used a julienne slicer for this to save time). Next, rinse the Baby Bella mushrooms and chop those as well. Chop garlic by hand or use a garlic press and set aside.  

Place a large pot on medium heat and drizzle olive oil until it covers the base. Allow it to warm and then toss in your mushrooms. Cover them in half a tablespoon of salt and 1/4 tablespoon of pepper.  

Cook the mushrooms down until they have shrunk significantly, browned, and the liquid has evaporated. This may take 20-25 minutes. Once the mushrooms are done, scoop them into a bowl and set them aside.  

Drizzle more olive oil until the bottom of the pan is once again covered, and add the onions, celery, and carrots. Top with 1/4 tablespoon of salt. Cook until onions are translucent and veggies are softened. Then add the bundle of herbs and cook for two minutes (by now the kitchen should smell insanely good).  

Add the garlic and cook for a maximum of one minute (do not brown the garlic). Next, add the tomato paste, soy sauce, and miso. Stir the mixture together. Then add the wine (which you are hopefully drinking while you do this). I prefer Cabernet but it’s up to you.  

Stir and cook the mixture until the wine has reduced and the mixture has thickened. Add the mushrooms back and allow to sit for a couple of minutes as you gather the cans of tomatoes. Add the San Marzano; some choose to puree the tomatoes but I prefer to crush them in the pan with my stirring implement as I go along.  

Don’t waste the porcini liquid from the soaking mushrooms! Add it at this time and raise the temperature to medium high heat until you see bubbles.  

Stir the mixture and decrease the temperature to medium low and cover. Allow at least an hour. The finished product should look like the above image. Fish out the herbs, and it’s ready to serve! Top with parsley if desired. The yield should be enough to freeze plenty for future use. Enjoy!

Creamy Pappardelle with Leeks and Bacon (substitute fettuccini)
https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/creamy-pappardelle-with-leeks-and-bacon

Here is a recipe I make a lot:

Start cooking pasta. In a large frying pan heat 5 tbs. good olive oil over med high. Add 2 or 3 cloves finely minced garlic and 1 tsp freshly grated pepper and cook for 3 minutes. Add 2 cups bread crumbs (if you have fresh - if not use 1 1/2 cups panko or regular). Cook until golden (about 4 or 5 minutes). Add cooked drained pasta with 1 tsp lemon zest. Toss to cover the pasta with bread crumbs. Top with grated parmesan and more lemon zest if you want - serve.

8hfsrj,How I (Italian born and raised in Italy) make Carbonara Spaghetti for my Canadian husband,985,102,1525619483.0,0.94,Pasta,ilaria903,https://imgur.com/a/AwG5GVQ,"(The picture is just for showing the dish) I have made this version of carbonara spaghetti cooking for my Canadian husband. I am Italian and the original recipe is slightly different. You should be using just pecorino cheese and guanciale (pork's cheek) for it but it seems like this version has more flavour and so I just cook it that way for him and my friends now. Everyone loves it! English is not my first language so don't mind all the spelling mistakes you might find.                    
  __________________                                
 Ilaria's carbonara (4 servings)                 
500 g spaghetti                
 200 g pancetta (Italian bacon)              
 50 g pecorino cheese              
 30 g parmesan             
 4 eggs              
black pepper              
salt                 
1) Cut the bacon in thin cubes. Fry it on the pan (without any oil) at a low flame until crispy. Keep it in the pan with the fat you'll add to the pasta mix later.             
 2) Boil the water with a bit of salt. Make sure not to put a lot of it because the bacon already gives the dish a lot of flavour. The water has to be slightly less than half of the pot.             
 3) In a bowl mix the eggs with a fork for just a few seconds.             
 4) Grate the pecorino cheese and the parmesan and keep aside.            
 5) Cook the pasta when the water's boiling and cook it until ""al dente"". This means cooking the pasta until just moment before it's ready, when it is slightly tougher to bite into. This is ""al dente"" (lit. at a tooth). Before using the strainer keep a glass of cooking pasta, in case you need to make the pasta more creamy later.                 
 6) In the bowl with the eggs add all the other ingridients: bacon (with the fat from the pan), pecorino and parmesan and then the pasta, and some black pepper and then mix well. If the eggs and the cheese look too dry on the pasta and you want to make it creamy pour the glass you kept from the cooking water to give it a more creamy texture, and keep mixing. Lastly add more cheese or pepper if needed.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/8hfsrj/how_i_italian_born_and_raised_in_italy_make/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/8hfsrj/how_i_italian_born_and_raised_in_italy_make/
8cybs4,Crispy chorizo pasta bake,38,11,1523986017.0,0.95,Pasta,dublinflavourdoc,https://i.redd.it/c97i88s77is01.jpg,"(makes 5 portions) 
Ingredients:


1 tbsp olive oil

50g chorizo chopped

1 onion chopped

3 garlic cloves chopped

1 chilli chopped

0.5 tsp oregano

2 400g tins chopped tomatoes

1 tsp salt

1 tsp pepper



400g dried pasta (I used tortiglioni)

1 pack light mini mozzarella (~125g drained)

gratered parmesan

(optional breadcrumbs)


Method:

Fry the onions and chorizo with the olive oil over medium heat until onions are translucent (7 min). Add the garlic, chilli, oregano and cook for a further 3 min. Add the chopped tomatoes, salt and pepper and simmer on low for at least 30 min. Taste and adjust for salt.
In the meantime pre-heat oven to 210 celcius, cook the pasta as per the cooking instructions but reduce the cooking time by 3 mins (as they will slightly cook in the oven). Drain and empty into a suitable oven-dish. 
Cover the pasta with the sauce, mix and then top with the chopped mozzarella, then gratered parmesan and then the breadcrumbs. 

Place in oven and cook for approximately 15 mins until all the cheese is melted and you have a nice browned/crispy surface. Serve with a crisp salad and enjoy!


Hope you all like this recipe. I feel it could work with the addition of chicken if you want to incorporate more protein into your meal. However at the time I thought it better to just serve it on the side.

Recipe yields 4 servings and can be easily halved to serve 2 if needed!

***

**Ingredients**

   * 12-16 oz shrimp (fresh or frozen and thawed)
   * 8 oz Chickapea Pasta
   * 1 TBSP oil for sauteing (avocado, olive, coconut, etc...) plus extra as needed
   * 2 bell peppers, any color
   * 1 medium onion
   * 3/4 tsp chili powder
   * 1/2 tsp cumin
   * 1/2 tsp paprika
   * 1/4 tsp garlic powder
   * 1/4 tsp sea salt
   * 1/8 tsp black pepper
   * 1 cup enchilada sauce, plus extra if desired

**TASTY TOPPINGS**

   * 2-4 oz grated cheese (skip for dairy-free)
   * 1 jalapeño, sliced thin
   * 1/2 lime, cut into wedges
   * chopped green onion and/or cilantro, to taste

**OPTIONAL EXTRAS**

   * guacamole or chopped/sliced avocado
   * a dollop of sour cream or greek yogurt
   * pickled/marinated red onion
   * pico de gallo
   * hot sauce

***
**Instructions**

1. If you plan on popping this bad boy in the oven to melt the cheese, use an oven-safe pot/pan and pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees F. Prefer to stir the cheese into the pasta? Skip the oven!
    
2. Clean and peel shrimp, defrosting if needed. Lately we've been buying frozen, deveined, easy-peel shrimp. All I have to do is defrost, peel, and cook! You can also buy your shrimp already peeled if you'd like! Set shrimp aside and start on the pasta.
    
3. Cook pasta, uncovered in a large pot of boiling water. Season with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-8 minutes or until desired tenderness is reached. Rinse in a colander with cold water. Drain and set aside
    
4. While your pasta boils, slice your bell pepper and chop your onion. Bring a large high-sided pan or skillet to medium-high heat with 1 TBSP of oil. Sauté onion and peppers until edges are browned and softened. Reduce heat to medium.
    
5. Pat shrimp dry and season with chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well to coat both sides.
    
6. Move veggies to the side, add a bit more oil, as needed, and add your shrimp to the pan. Cook on each side for about 2 minutes until shrimp curl and become opaque. The cook time will depend on the heat setting you choose and the size of your shrimp, but regardless they’ll be perfectly cooked in a matter of minutes. Add your cooked, drained pasta and enchilada sauce. Gently fold everything together. If you'd like, feel free to use additional sauce! Sometimes I go light and other times I'll make it extra saucy!
    
7. Add your cheese. You can swirl it into the pasta or sprinkle on top and use an oven mit to transfer pot to oven, uncovered, for a few minutes until hot and melty!
    
8. Now pile on the toppings! I added lime wedges (I love to squeeze a little lime juice into the dish before diving in) along with cilantro and fresh jalapeños. It's also kind of amazing with a dollop of sour cream and some salsa!

887n8l,Authentic Roman Spaghetti alla Carbonara,714,32,1522382461.0,0.97,Pasta,ItalianFlyer,https://i.redd.it/9kp05q1zpto01.jpg,"Being originally from Rome, Carbonara is my favorite pasta, and a very controversial one for that matter. Some things are generally agreed upon, such as the fact that there should be no cream in the dish, but even within Italy people can't agree on how it should really be made! Do you use Guanciale (cured pork cheek) or Pancetta? Do you use onion, or garlic, both, or neither? Does Parmigiano have a place in it or should it be purely Pecorino Romano? Here is my take on the controversy. This is the traditional Carbonara how I used to make it in Rome and how I still make it now, living in the US  
  
**Ingredients (for 2 people)**:  
•	2 Eggs. If you want a more rich texture and deeper color, you can add an additional yoke  
•	2 slices of Guanciale/Pancetta/Bacon  
•	½ of a small Onion, chopped finely  
•	Grated Pecorino Romano  
•	Black Pepper  
•	200g of Pasta (I recommend either Spaghetti, Rigatoni, or Mezze Maniche)  
   
**Directions**  
  
1.	Chop the onion finely and cut the guanciale/pancetta/bacon into little stripes or cubes, depending on the thickness of slice you chose to use.  
2.	Grate the Pecorino Romano cheese  
3.	Beat the eggs until uniform, then add the grated cheese to them. I cannot recommend an exact amount as this needs to happen by feel. Start with a fist’s full and see what the consistency turns out to be (that should put you pretty close already) then adjust to achieve a creamy mixture.  
4.	Begin to boil a pot of water with some coarse sea salt. A rule of thumb is that for every 100g of pasta, you use 1 liter of water with 10g of salt. Every liter of water you add, add 10 more grams of salt.   
5.	Heat up a non-stick pan over high heat and add the guanciale/pancetta/bacon when it’s hot. There is no need to add any oil as the pork will kick out a significant amount of fat.  
6.	 When some of the fat has been rendered out, add the onions and continue cooking together until the guanciale/pancetta/bacon is crispy and the onions are fully cooked.  
7.	When everything is cooked, turn off the fire and take the pan off the heat. Physically move it away from the stove. Let it cool for a minute or two then add the mixture of eggs and Pecorino cheese. Don’t add it too soon after turning the heat off or you’ll end up with scrambled eggs.   
8.	Season with abundant black pepper  
9.	When the pasta is ready (al dente, don’t overcook it!), drain it and toss it around in the pan with the sauce with the heat off to mix everything together before serving.

Makes 5 portions

Ingredients:

400g pasta (I used conchiglie)

1 large head of broccoli chopped into small chunks

1 tbsp oil

600g chicken cubed

Handful of cherry tomatoes, chopped

50g low fat pesto

100g ricotta

salt &amp; pepper

Parmesan

Method:

Turn on oven to 200 Celsius.

Cook pasta in heavily salted water according to instructions on pack but reduce cooking time by 3 mins. When the pasta is 3 min from being ready, add all the broccoli. Cook for 3 further mins and then drain, reserving the pasta water (KEY).

In the meantime, heat the oil over high heat, add the chicken and cook for about 5 mins (not fully cooked), add salt and pepper.

It's our one year wedding anniversary today, so we decided to treat ourselves to something a bit decadent and spicy. This dinner came together really quickly and makes a TON!

#GRADE

Serves: 6-8

Cost: $$

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: 1 hour (30 minutes inactive)

#INGREDIENTS

16 ounces pasta of your choice

2 teaspoons olive oil

1 small bunch of fresh parsley

1 medium yellow onion

1 tablespoon garlic butter (Or 1 tablespoon butter and 2 garlic cloves)

1/4 cup dry red wine

28 ounces crushed tomatoes

28 ounces petite diced tomatoes

Crushed red pepper, salt, pepper, and sugar to taste

1 pound peeled deveined shrimp (tails on or tails removed depending on your preference)

2 cups fresh spinach

1/2 cup heavy cream

Extra virgin olive oil for serving

#METHOD

Prepare Ingredients: Bring a large pot of salted water with the 2 teaspoons of olive oil to a boil. Mince the parsley. Dice the yellow onion. Pat the shrimp dry and season with salt and pepper.

Start the Sauce: Heat a slick of olive oil over medium high heat in a large pot. Once hot, add the onion and cook, stirring regularly, for 8-10 minutes until very brown. Add the garlic butter and continue cooking an additional 3-4 minutes until the butter is very frothy and browned. Add the red wine and reduce heat to a simmer, scraping off any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in all the tomatoes and season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste. Stir in a sprinkle of sugar. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes.

Cook the Pasta Stir the pasta into the boiling water and cook until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining. Toss the pasta with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and the minced parsley and set aside.

Finish the Sauce: Taste the sauce and season with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, or sugar according to your taste. Stir in the shrimp and spinach and cook for 5-7 minutes until the shrimp are opaque and cooked through and the spinach has wilted. Stir in the heavy cream and reserved pasta cooking water and cook an additional 4-5 minutes. Toss the pasta in the sauce and cook for 1-2 minutes more before removing from heat.

To Serve: Serve the pasta in shallow bowls topped with a tiny drizzle of extra virgin olive oil (if desired) and a crack of fresh pepper.

Noodles:

* 2 boxes (750g) oven-ready lasagne noodles

Meat Sauce:

* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 large white onions, diced
* 2 large yellow zucchini, diced (or 3 small ones)
* 225g button mushrooms, diced
* 450g each ground beef, pork and veal
* 350g tomato paste
* 2L tomato coulis (plain tomato sauce with no additives)
* 20g table salt

Mornay Sauce:

* 15g butter
* 15g flour
* 250ml heavy cream (35%)
* 10g fresh ground pepper
* 2 wedges of Laughing Cow cheese

Cheese Crust:

* 500g mozzarella, grated
* 270g aged cheddar, grated
* 12 slices of provolone
* Dried oregano and parsley, to dust

Directions:

In a large hot frying pan, drizzle lightly with olive oil and press small chunks of each of the ground meats onto the surface carefully. Turn after 30 seconds or so with thongs, to allow a crust to form on each side. Place crusted chunks to the side once done.

In a large pot, drizzle bottom with olive oil and add minced garlic and diced onion on medium heat. Sweat for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add mushrooms and zucchini, and cook for an additional 5-7 minutes. 

Add tomato paste, tomato coulis, meats and salt. Stir thoroughly to break up the chunks of meat and cover. Once simmering, reduce heat to low and stir occasionally, allowing sauce to thicken considerably. Remove covering and slightly increase heat if a faster reduction time is desired; this may require more frequent attention and stirring. I generally leave this stage for a good 3-4 hours. Once sufficiently thickened, remove from heat.

While meat sauce is cooling, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat and mix flour in to form your roux. Allow to cook for about 5 minutes, whisking often to prevent burning. Add cream, pepper and laughing cow wedges, broken into chunks. Increase heat to medium high until bubbling, whisking constantly. Remove from heat after about 5 minutes.

Once sauces are cooler, arrange lasagne noodles in a deep oven pan, layer meat sauce then drizzle Mornay above it before adding the next layer. On the top layer, before adding the shredded cheese, add the remainder of the meat sauce as a buffer, to prevent the noodles from buckling. 

Add the shredded cheeses and then provolone slices to the top. Dust with herbs, then bake at 175ºC (350ºF) for about 30 minutes. If needed, set oven to broil at the end to achieve desired brownness for the cheese crust.

Allow to cool for a minimum of 20 minutes before serving - it retains a lot of heat, and you don't taste anything when your mouth is being burnt!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/6u4w4y/3meat_lasagne_with_mushrooms_and_zucchini_pepper/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/6u4w4y/3meat_lasagne_with_mushrooms_and_zucchini_pepper/

62udmm,Need a fantastic recipe for Mac and cheese,64,30,1491070015.0,0.88,Pasta,Drag0nV3n0m231,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/62udmm/need_a_fantastic_recipe_for_mac_and_cheese/,"I personally love this one and use it excessively.

The amounts depend on the glassware size and personal preference.

Baked macaroni:

-Half a stick of butter

-A glass pan

-Macaroni

-Sharp Cheddar

-Feta cheese

-2-4 cloves of garlic

-Half an onion or onion powder

-Any other cheese you desire

-Whole milk

-Fresh grounded pepper

Step zero: preheat oven to 350f

Step one: melt half a stick of butter into the glass pan.

Step two: add diced or crushed garlic, and diced onion or onion powder to the buttery glass pan.

Step three: fill the glass pan halfway with un*cooked* macaroni.

Step four: add shredded sharp cheddar and feta and other cheeses

(Variant) shake some macaroni then add some cheese. Repeat until pasta and cheese are semilayered. It doesn't much matter how organized all this is.

Step five: shred fresh pepper on top. I like a medium amount ~10ml

Step six: slowly pour milk over entire dish getting all the cheese and macaroni wet. Do this until the milk is level with the pasta. A little more to make it a but runny. Any less will make it crunchy.

Step seven: bake at 350 for 45 minutes.

Edit:This ""recipe"" requires a good eye and knowing what you like. I wouldn't over do it with the onion so be conservative with it. The reason I use sharper cheeses is because the milk makes it all more mild. Feel free to use loads of cheese.

I don't have this written down but thankfully anything you might make excess of is dirt cheap.

First cook enough mac to fill the casserole dish ~3/4 full once cooked. Assume the pasta will approximately double in size from dry. This is one of the step where cooking to much costs you 12 cents, better be safe.

Next make a [white sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlMtbX-0ABA). Again it's flour butter and milk, if you make 3x more then you need it costs pennies. 

Once cooked ""measure"" the pasta by putting it back into the casserole dish. Discard the excess, and move the rest to a pot, on a low heat. Add in a white sauce, and make it runny'er or thinner then you would think, the pasta absorbs it. 

From there I add a can of escargot. Walmart sells them in a tin, 4 oz. Roughly chop them and add. Also add ~8 oz of clams, also from a tin, roughly chopped. Once that is mixed in I add ~5 oz of the 9 oz tin of tomato pesto, that you can also buy at Walmart.

The very last thing I do is mix in the cheese. I like sharp cheddar and parmesan. Then put this all in a pan, cover with bread ""chunks"" (not crumbs) and bake at 350 for about 30 min.

3eezv5,[Request] Hit me with your best mac and cheese recipe.,17,13,1437718162.0,0.82,Pasta,ms_sea_cat,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/3eezv5/request_hit_me_with_your_best_mac_and_cheese/,"Here's roughly what I do, I generally don't measure, and I like to add stuff if I feel like it. 

You need:

2 tablespoons of butter

2 tablespoons of flour

2 cups milk

~2 cups pasta, cooked al dente (never actually measured this, I just eyeball it per the amount of sauce I've got going)

~2 cups cheese of your choice, 1/2 cubed, 1/2 finely shredded (same as pasta, I always eyeball this amount)
Salt, pepper

Optional: bacon/ham, garlic

Directions:
Preheat oven: 350F
1. Get pasta cooking

2. Brown (but don't burn!) butter in a medium saucepan

3. Once butter is a nutty brown color, mix in flour to create a paste.
 
4. Once the flour is fully incorporated, immediately add the milk and whisk the mixture together

5. Simmer on low heat until boiling, season as desired (salt, pepper,  maybe some minced garlic)

6. Remove from heat and add grated cheese, mix thoroughly

7. In a medium baking dish, mix together the sauce, pasta, and cubed cheese. If desired, mix in cubed ham or precooked, chopped bacon, and sprinkle the top with more cheese. I also like to give it a sprinkle of smoked paprika before tossing it in the oven. 

8. Bake at 350F for about an hour, or until a brown crispy layer has formed on top. 

Tips:
The browned butter really adds a whole depth of flavor, don't skip that part, but be extra careful not to burn it, *especially* once you have added the flour. That can be dicey. I usually go for a three/four cheese mix, sharp cheddar, smoked gouda, muenster, and Gruyere are my typical go-to's.

Seems good :) I'd say to add a bit of salt in the flour, when you start. Also a spoon of olive oil. There's no agreement on these, you should try and tell me what way you like it most.

You missed ham. It's a very tasty extra.

Next time, try red wine or water instead of beer or martini. I don't drink wine, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't kill the taste, like beer or even worse martini.
Of course, it could take longer to get drunk so you are free to ignore me.

Oh, if you are sober again, I'd like to recommend [this recipe](http://ricette.giallozafferano.it/Ragu-alla-bolognese.html).

8. Stir fry the diced chicken breasts until they are nicely browned.
9. Take the chicken breasts out and set them aside.
10. Add 1 tsp of vegetable oil to your pan or wok.
11. While the oil is still cool, add 1 + ½ tbsp red oil bean paste then keep stirring until you can see visible red oil spreading. (Keep the heat at a lower setting if it is your first time cooking Chinese food.)
12. Add in the chopped leek gently and stir fry for a few minutes, until softened.
13. Add the stir-fried diced chicken breasts and mix well.
14. Add the fried peanuts.
15. Gently mix the sauce again and pour into your pan or wok, mix well with the rest of the ingredients. Turn heat to maximum.
16. Keep stirring until the sauce is thickened and coated nicely on the rest of the ingredients in the pan or wok.
17. Plate and serve with rice.

**Portions:** 4

**Prep time: 30 min**

**Cook time: 1,5h**

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

**\* 4 Chicken legs separated into thighs and drumsticks**

**\* 3 cups Red Wine (750 ml) preferably Burgundy or a similar full-bodied wine**

**\* 1 cup Pearl Onions (200g) peeled**

**\* ½ cup Lardons (100g) or thick-cut bacon, diced**

**\* 3 Sprigs of fresh Thyme**

**\* 2 Bay Leaves**

**\* 4 Garlic Cloves minced**

**\* 2 Shallots finely chopped**

**\* 1 cup Button Mushrooms quartered**

**\* 2 tbsp Brandy (optional)**

**\* 2 tbsp Unsalted Butter**

**\* 2 tbsp All-purpose flour**

**\* Salt to taste**

**\* Black Pepper to taste**

**\* Fresh Parsley for garnish**

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

1. In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, red wine, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, minced garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well, ensuring the chicken is well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.
2. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the lardons or bacon and cook until crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
3. In the same skillet, add the remaining butter. Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving the wine and herbs. Pat the chicken dry and brown on all sides, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set aside.
4. Add the chopped shallots to the skillet and sauté until translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for another minute. Add the mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and become golden.
5. If using, pour the brandy over the vegetables and carefully ignite with a long lighter. Allow the flames to subside.
6. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes.
7. Pour in the reserved wine from the marinade, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Allow the wine to simmer and reduce by a third.
8. Return the browned chicken pieces and crispy lardons to the skillet. Add the pearl onions, thyme, and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper.
9. Stove top cooking method: Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let the chicken simmer in the wine for about 1-1.5 hours, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened.
10. Dutch oven cooking method: After combining the chicken, lardons, pearl onions, thyme, and bay leaves in the Dutch oven, cover with the lid and bake in a preheated oven at 325°F (165°C) for 1-1.5 hours until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened, checking occasionally and adding broth or water if needed.
11. Once cooked, remove the thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve the Coq au Vin hot, sprinkled with fresh parsley. Pair with crusty French bread or potatoes and enjoy this classic French dish! I prepared potato pancakes to go with it 🙂

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

Servings: 4

Calories: 413

**Ingredients**

* 3 pounds bone-in chicken
* 8 cups water more as needed
* 1 head garlic halved crosswise
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and thinly sliced
* 2 jalapeños trimmed and sliced into rounds
* 1 large bunch cilantro roughly chopped, a pinch reserved for garnish
* 10 scallions trimmed and minced, a pinch reserved for garnish
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Toasted bread
* Sliced avocado
* Lime wedges

**Boil the Chicken:**

* Place the chicken into a large soup pot and cover with 6-8 cups of water. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Add the halved garlic head and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes until chicken is completely cooked through and falling off the bone. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl to cool. Remove the garlic and transfer to a plate to cool.
* Bring the broth back to a boil for 15 minutes until it reduces down a bit. (Note: you can skip this step, but I like a very rich, reduced broth).
* Strain the broth into a bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.
* Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat and discard the skin and carcass.
* Pop the garlic cloves out of the paper and discard the paper. With a fork, mash the cloves into a paste and set aside.

**Prepare the Chicken Verde Soup:**

* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the sliced yellow onion and cook for 5 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic paste and cook for 45 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.
* Pour in reserved chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the cilantro, scallions, jalapeño, and shredded chicken. Reduce heat and cook for 15 minutes or until the onion is very soft and the broth is aromatic. Taste and season to your preferences. Add more water if needed. Turn off the heat.

**To Serve**

* Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the reserved cilantro, scallions and avocado. Squeeze lime juice over each bowl. Enjoy!

Aji amarillo paste is a perfect accompaniment to creamy arborio rice in this a aji amarillo risotto with chicken.

Prep Time: 20 minutes

Cook Time: 40 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour

Servings: 5

**Ingredients**

* 1 tablespoon olive oil for frying
* 1 yellow onion peeled and minced
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and finely chopped
* 5 cloves garlic peeled and very thinly sliced or minced
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 2 cups arborio rice
* ¼–¾ cup aji amarillo paste, more or less to taste, depending on how spicy your brand of aji amarillo is
* ¾ cup dry white wine (or use more stock)
* 5-6 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil for frying
* 5 skin-on chicken thighs
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Parsley, optional, for serving

**Before starting:**

1. Warm the stock in a microwave or in a small pot on the stove. Turn heat to low and keep warm. Preheat oven to 425ºF.

**Start the Risotto:**

1. Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 2-3 minutes until it just begins to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook for 12-13 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are golden brown. 
2. They should release all their liquid, and the liquid should evaporate from the pan. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the Chicken:**

1. As the mushrooms are cooking, start the chicken. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat neutral cooking oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook without moving for 5 minutes until the skin is very crispy and browned. Flip the chicken and transfer to the oven for 20-25 minutes until completely cooked through. Turn off the oven and keep the chicken in the oven as you finish the risotto to keep it warm.

**Cook the Rice:**

1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the rice. Cook, stirring regularly, for 2-3 minutes until the rice is coated with butter and begins to turn golden brown.
2. Add the aji amarillo paste and toss to coat.
3. Pour in the white wine and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low.
4. Once the wine has been absorbed, add 1 cup of the stock and stir regularly until absorbed. Continue on, adding a cup of stock, stirring until absorbed, and then adding more stock until all of the stock has been incorporated, about 20-25 minutes total. Taste and season to your preferences. Turn off the heat and allow the risotto to rest for 5 minutes before serving.

**To Serve:**

1. Divide the risotto between shallow bowls and serve with a chicken thigh on top. Garnish with parsley, if desired. Enjoy!

**Meatballs:**

* ¼ cup heavy cream
* 1 egg
* ½ cup panko, plus more as needed
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* Big pinch of crushed red pepper
* ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
* 1 pound ground turkey
* Salt and pepper
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, for frying; plus more if needed

**Sauce:**

* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* ½ cup sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* Crushed red pepper, to taste
* ½ cup water or chicken broth
* 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
* Pinch of sugar
* 15 basil leaves, torn; plus more for serving

**Make the meatballs:**

1. In a bowl, whisk together the cream and egg until smooth.
2. Add ½ cup panko, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, a big pinch of crushed red pepper, and the Parmesan cheese. Mix until combined and add a pinch of salt and pepper.
3. Add the turkey to the bowl and season with salt and pepper. Use your hands to mix until combined, adding more panko as needed. The mixture should hold together but still be moist and not too firm.

5. Roll the mixture into 2-inch balls; you should have about 12 meatballs. If you prefer smaller meatballs, roll them into tablespoon-sized balls, and you should have about 20 meatballs.

**Fry the meatballs:**

1. Return the heat on the pot to medium. Add the meatballs in an even layer and cook without moving for 3–4 minutes per side until browned all over.

Add the sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.
2. Pour in the water or broth and scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and add the tomatoes and salt and a pinch of sugar. Bring the tomatoes to a boil and add the meatballs. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
3. Remove the lid and check the temperature of the meatballs. Once they reach 165ºF, transfer them to a plate and scatter 5 fresh basil leaves on top of the meatballs along with a pinch more Parmesan cheese.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Tear the remaining basil leaves and add them to the sauce with the cooked pasta and toss to coat. Taste and season.

**To serve:**

1. Serve the sauced pasta at the table with the platter of turkey meatballs. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15c8tlc/turkey_meatballs_with_sundried_tomato_sauce/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15c8tlc/turkey_meatballs_with_sundried_tomato_sauce/
15aae6f,Rotisserie Chicken Tacos with Spiced Potatoes [OC],535,17,1690388746.0,0.97,Poultry,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/i5iufq0h5ceb1.jpg,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Rotisserie Chicken Tacos**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/rotisserie-chicken-tacos/)

I use a rotisserie chicken to make the tacos, and it's so good and a little less fussy than starting with raw on a weeknight. I also make use of leftover baked potatoes which work perfectly as a quick side dish. You can always use raw potatoes instead, but you'll just need to increase the roasting time!

You don't have to go so ham with all the sides and sauces like I did, but I didn't find this too labor-intensive because so many of the ingredients repeat across the sides. I also use bagged shredded cabbage for the slaw to save time :)

**Chicken:**

* 1 teaspoon neutral oil
* 1 plain rotisserie chicken, meat picked from the bones and torn into bite-sized pieces; make sure you save the carcass for stock!
* ½ small red onion, peeled and sliced; you’ll use the other half in the slaw!
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 1 tablespoon cumin powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ cup salsa verde or your favorite tomato salsa
* ¼ cup water, plus more as needed
* Salt, if needed

**Potatoes:**

* 2 leftover baked potatoes, cut into cubes
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 2 teaspoons chili powder
* 2 teaspoons cumin powder
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* ¼ teaspoon cayenne powder
* 1 lime, optional

**Slaw:**

* 10 ounces shredded red cabbage
* 1 English cucumber, thinly sliced
* 1 small jalapeño, peeled and minced
* ⅓ cup loosely packed cilantro, minced
* ½ small red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
* 4 tablespoons mayonnaise
* 1 grapefruit, juiced
* 2 teaspoons sugar, plus more to taste
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* Salt to taste

**Avocado sauce:**

* 1 large avocado, peeled and pitted
* ⅓ cup sour cream
* 1–2 limes, juiced; use 1 lime if you don’t want it so tangy!
* ½ cup loosely packed cilantro
* 1–2 tablespoons water, plus more as needed
* Salt

**For serving:**

* 12 small flour or corn tortillas

**Make the chicken:**

1. Preheat the oven to 400ºF.
2. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and red onion and cook for 2–3 minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, and garlic powder, and cook for 2 minutes until fragrant.
3. Pour in the salsa and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer as you prepare the rest of the recipe. Taste and add salt, if needed. Add more water as needed if the chicken begins to stick as it simmers.

**Make the potatoes:**

1. Toss the cubed potatoes on a baking sheet with the oil and spices. Season with salt and transfer to the oven for 15 minutes until they begin to crisp up around the edges. Remove from the oven and juice the lime over the potatoes if you like. Keep warm. *Note: If using raw potatoes, roast for 35–40 minutes instead.*

**Make the slaw:**

1. Gather the cabbage, cucumber, jalapeño, cilantro, and red onion in a large bowl. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and set aside.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, grapefruit juice, sugar, chili powder, and a big pinch of salt. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.
3. Pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Transfer to the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

**Make the avocado sauce:**

1. While the potatoes roast, make the slaw and transfer to the refrigerator–ideally for 30 minutes–but it’s okay to enjoy it a little sooner :)
2. Combine the avocado, sour cream, lime juice, and cilantro in a food processor and pulse until smooth. Add water, starting with 1–2 tablespoons–and pulse until smooth. Add more water until the sauce reaches a drizzling consistency. Taste and add salt. Note: if you don’t want to break out the food processor, you can mash the avocado and mince the cilantro. Simply mash all of the ingredients together with a fork until mostly smooth.

**To serve:**

1. Warm up the tortillas and pile the chicken on each tortilla. Drizzle with the avocado sauce and add a spoonful of slaw on top. Serve with the warm potatoes on the side.

Some people have asked why i didn't make the katsu sauce...I was replicating this off a soup i used to get at a local restaurant and they never served with the katsu sauce. i like the pairing of the crispy chicken with the light broth... if you like the sauce, you can definitely serve it on top!

**Udon:**

* 4 scallions, white and light green parts kept separate
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced
* 2 teaspoons minced ginger
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 5 cups water
* 2 teaspoons dashi granules
* ¼ cup light soy sauce, more to taste
* 2 tablespoons mirin
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil, divided
* 16 ounces frozen or dry udon
* 10 ounces broccoli florets
* 2 teaspoons sesame seeds
* Salt

**Chicken:**

* 1 pound thin-sliced chicken breasts
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon white pepper
* 1–2 teaspoons shichimi togarashi
* 4 eggs
* 2 cups panko
* Salt and pepper
* Vegetable oil for frying

**Prepare the scallions:**

1. Mince the white parts of the scallions and set them aside. Thinly slice the green parts on a steep bias and transfer them to a small bowl. Set aside.

**Prepare the broth:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and mushrooms and cook for 6–8 minutes. Season lightly with salt.
2. Add the ginger, garlic, and minced white parts of the scallions. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
3. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add the dashi granules, soy sauce, mirin, and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Simmer as you prepare the chicken and noodles.

**Cook the noodles:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the udon and cook according to package instructions. Drain and rinse. Divide the noodles between bowls.

**Dredge the chicken:**

1. Heat 1½ inch of oil in a medium-sized pot until it reaches 350ºF. Test the oil temperature with an instant-read thermometer. Adjust the heat as needed between medium-low and medium-high to keep a consistent temperature for frying.
2. Prepare your dredging station by setting out three large shallow bowls. Add the flour, white pepper, and shichimi togarashi to the first bowl. Use 1 teaspoon shichimi togarashi for a subtle heat or 2 teaspoons for spicier undertones in the breading.
3. Crack the eggs into the second bowl and whisk with a fork until well beaten.
4. In the third bowl, add the panko and a pinch of salt.
5. Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.
6. Dip one piece of chicken into the flour until fully coated. Shake off the excess and then dip it into the beaten eggs. Ensure the chicken is completely coated with eggs. Allow any excess to drip off and then dip into the panko. Use your fingers to press the panko into each piece of chicken evenly. Transfer to a wire rack and continue on until all the chicken is breaded.
7. Fry the chicken in batches for 3–4 minutes per side or until the chicken registers 165ºF. Transfer to a wire rack to allow the excess oil to drip off, and continue until the chicken is fried.

*Note: As you add chicken to the oil, it can bring the temperature of the oil down. Continue to check the temperature of the oil and adjust the heat periodically to keep it around 350ºF.*

**Finish the udon:**

1. Turn the heat on the broth to medium-high. Once it bubbles, add the broccoli florets, cook until bright green and tender-crisp, and immediately turn off the heat. Taste and season the broth.

**Prepare the garnish:**

1. Right before serving, drizzle the reserved scallion greens with the remaining 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and the sesame seeds. Toss to coat.

**To serve:**

1. Thinly slice the chicken cross-wise. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and place a sliced chicken breast on top of each bowl. Add a spoonful of the scallion green garnish to each bowl, and enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/156rkmh/chicken_katsu_udon_soup/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/156rkmh/chicken_katsu_udon_soup/
14kl7l6,Ground Turkey and Sun-Dried Tomato Ragù,644,16,1687889877.0,0.98,Poultry,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/fo8c0ta0rl8b1.jpg,"**Recipe here originally: [Ground Turkey and Sun-Dried Tomato Ragù](https://newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com/p/recipe-for-the-week-c65)**

I use green bell pepper in this ragù because I like the sharper flavor it adds in contrast to the sun-dried tomatoes. If you prefer sweeter peppers, use red or orange bell peppers, or try it with one green and one red bell pepper for a mix. If you’re not a fan of ground turkey, make this with pork or beef instead.

Cook time: 55 minutes | Serves: 5

* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 pound ground turkey
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and small-diced
* 1 green bell pepper, trimmed, seeded, and small-diced
* ¼ cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, chopped
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, divided; plus more to taste
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* Crushed red pepper, to taste
* ¼ cup water
* 14.5-ounce can fire-roasted crushed tomatoes
* ½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, divided
* 16 ounces mezzi rigatoni or another tubular pasta of choice
* Fresh basil leaves, for serving
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Cook the turkey:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the turkey and season all over with salt, pepper, and half the Italian seasoning. Cook for 12–15 minutes, breaking it up as it cooks, until well-browned and cooked through. Add more salt, if needed.
2. Transfer the cooked turkey to a bowl.

**Cook the aromatics:**

1. If the pot is dry, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and turn the heat back to medium. Add the diced onion, bell pepper, and sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 5–7 minutes until the onion and peppers soften. Season with salt.
2. Melt the butter into the pot and add the remaining Italian seasoning along with the garlic powder, paprika, and crushed red pepper to taste. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the ragù:**

1. Return the turkey to the pot and cook for 1–2 minutes.
2. Pour in the water and crushed tomatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes until thickened. Taste and add more salt or Italian seasoning if needed. Stir the ragù occasionally to prevent it from sticking.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add plenty of salt. Cook the pasta according to package instructions. Scoop out ½ cup of the pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta.

**Finish the ragù:**

1. Taste the ragù and season once more to your preferences. Add all but a few pinches of the Parmesan along with half the pasta cooking water. Stir until the cheese melts into the sauce.
2. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat for 1–2 minutes, adding the remaining pasta cooking water if needed. Once the pasta is glossy and well-coated, turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the pasta onto a large serving platter and sprinkle the remaining Parmesan on top.

* 4-pound chicken, giblets reserved for another use
* 1 onion, peeled and sliced
* 1 jalapeño, halved
* Water
* 1–2 tablespoons shichimi togarashi, plus more to taste
* 1–2 teaspoons chili oil or sesame oil, optional (you can use a little of both if you like)
* 3 scallions, white parts minced and green parts sliced on a bias; keep the green and white parts separate
* Salt
* 9.5-ounce package soba noodles

Instructions:

**Boil the chicken:**

1. Place the chicken in a pot and cover with water. Season liberally with salt and add the sliced onion and halved jalapeño. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for at least an hour. Skim off any foam as it floats to the surface.

**Shred the chicken:**

1. Remove chicken from the broth and debone it once it’s cool enough to handle. Shred the chicken meat and reserve the carcass for another use.

**Strain the broth (optional):**

1. You can strain the broth in the pot through a sieve, but I didn’t bother this time. I just scooped out and discarded the halved jalapeño. If you want to strain off any impurities, simply pour through a sieve into a large bowl. Wipe out the pot and return the broth to the pot. Taste and season.

**Finish the broth:**

1. Return the broth back to a boil and add the shredded chicken, shichimi togarashi, and chili or sesame oil. Add the minced white parts of the scallions. Simmer for an additional 30 minutes until the broth is dark and rich. Taste and add more salt or shichimi togarashi, if needed.

**Cook the noodles:**

1. As the broth finishes cooking, bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the soba according to package instructions. Drain, rinse, and divide between bowls.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the chicken and broth over the cooked soba and garnish with the sliced green parts of the scallions.

	•	4 tbsp All Purpose Flour  
	•	1 Egg beaten  
	•	1 cup Panko Crumbs  
	•	Canola Oil for deep frying  
	•	4 cups Steamed Rice  
	•	1 cup Carrot Cabbage Slaw  
**Instructions** 

**Katsu Curry Sauce**  
	1.	Add oil to a Dutch Oven or large pot and heat over medium high heat. Add the onion and saute for 4-5 minutes or until translucent. Add the potatoes and carrots and stir for 3-4 minutes.  
	2.	Add water and turn the heat up to bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for 7-8 minutes, or until the vegetable are cooked through.  
	3.	Break the Japanese curry cubes into small blocks and add them to the pot. Stir gently to blend into the curry gravy.  
	4.	Reduce the heat to low, place a lid on the pot cook for 7-8 minutes or until the curry roux is completely incorporated. Stir occasionally as the curry tends to stick to the bottom of the pot.  
	5.	Check the consistency of the sauce. It should be like béchamel sauce. If it's too thick, add more water. Remove from heat and set aside.  
**Chicken Cutlets**  
	1.	Use a meat mallet to pound the chicken thighs so they are 1/4 inch thick. Season with salt and pepper on both sides.  
	2.	Place flour, egg and breadcrumbs into separate shallow bowls or plates.  
	3.	Working one chicken thigh at a time, coat a fillet with flour, shake off excess, run it through the egg, allow excess to drip off, then transfer to the panko crumbs and cover on all sides. Repeat for all 4 chicken thighs.  
	4.	Heat oil in a wok or deep skillet to 350°F. The amount of oil should be about 1¼” deep.  
	5.	Gently place a fillet into the hot oil. Depending on the size of the pan, you may fry more than one at a time. Do not over crowd.  
	6.	Fry for 3-4 minutes or until the bottom side is browned. Using tongs, flip the fillet and cook for further 3-4 minutes until the other side is crispy.  
	7.	Transfer the cutlet onto a tray lined with paper towel to drain excess oil. Cut each chicken cutlet into 1” wide strips.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13pnnvp/crispy_japanese_chicken_katsu_curry/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13pnnvp/crispy_japanese_chicken_katsu_curry/

Makes 36–38 dumplings

Dumplings:

* 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and minced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2 Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced
* 3 scallions, trimmed and minced
* 1 pound ground chicken
* 4 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 teaspoon hoisin sauce
* 2 teaspoons honey, maple syrup, or use sweet chili sauce, optional
* Pinch of white pepper
* Salt, to taste if needed
* 2 tablespoons water
* 36–38 dumpling wrappers, thawed if frozen
* Fresh scallions, optional, for serving

**Sauce:**

* ⅓ cup black vinegar
* 1–2 teaspoons chili oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds

**Prepare the filling:**

1. In a bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, chili peppers, and scallions. Add the ground chicken and season lightly with salt. Add the soy sauce, sesame oil, hoisin sauce, and honey if using. Sprinkle in the white pepper and mix well with a spoon. Add the water and stir to combine.
2. Fry or microwave a tiny piece of the mixture until cooked through. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.

**Fold the dumplings:**

1. First, get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation.
2. Next, place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the dumpling wrapper.
3. Wet the edges with water and fold the dumpling in half. Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling closed into a half-moon shape.

**Steam, pan-fry, or deep-fry the dumplings:**

1. To steam: Fill your steamer pot with water and place the rack on top. Place a liner on top. Bring the water to a boil and arrange the dumplings on top. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and steam for 10 minutes. Use a meat thermometer to ensure the chicken has reached 165ºF.
2. To pan-fry: Dip the bottoms of the dumplings into the water to coat the bottom, then dip into a bowl of sesame seeds to evenly coat the bottom. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high. Add the dumplings, sesame seed side down, and cook without moving for 1 minute. Pour in ¼ cup water and cover immediately. Cook for 3–4 minutes. Remove the lid and fry for an additional minute or so.
3. To deep-fry: Heat a few inches of oil in a large pot until the oil reaches 330ºF. Add dumplings in batches and deep-fry for 3–4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

I based this recipe off my duck egg roll recipe which I've made several times now, and it's always a huge hit. I made a few modifications to the filling based on ingredients I had readily available, but the filling is fantastic, with or without mushrooms.

You can also use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store - just make sure you finely chop it.

**Roast duck:**

* 4–5 pound duck; giblets, neck, and feet reserved for another use
* 1 orange, quartered
* Salt and pepper

**Filling:**

* 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and minced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 3 scallions, trimmed and minced
* 2 Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced
* 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
* 2 tablespoons thin soy sauce
* 1–2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce, optional, to taste
* ½ orange, juiced
* Salt, if needed

**Dumplings:**

* 24–28 dumpling wrappers
* Sliced scallion greens, optional, for garnish
* Water

**Sauce:**

* ⅓ cup black vinegar
* 1–2 teaspoons chili oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds

**Prepare the duck:**

1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF.
2. Line a roasting pan with foil. Place a raised rack in the pan and set aside.
3. Pat the duck dry and season it all over with salt and pepper.
4. Stuff the cavity with the orange wedges. Truss the legs with kitchen twine.

**Roast the duck:**

1. Place the duck on top of the raised rack and transfer it to the oven for 2 hours.
2. Remove the duck from the oven. Using a sharp knife, create a few shallow slits in the skin across the breast and around the thighs. This will allow the fat to fully render. Be careful not to cut the meat too much. You just need 6–8 slits all over the duck, particularly around the fatty area of the legs and breasts.
3. Return the duck to the oven for 1 hour.
4. Remove the duck from the oven and let cool as you prepare the filling.

**Prepare the filling:**

1. Gather the minced ginger, garlic, scallions, and Thai chili peppers in a bowl. Add the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, orange juice, and sweet chili sauce if you like.

**Shred the duck:**

1. Once the duck is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones. Avoid any meat that feels very sinewy. You can keep as much of the crispy skin as you like for the dumplings, particularly the skin around the breasts, thighs, and legs. I discard the skin on the back of the duck. Reserve the carcass for stock, if you like.
2. Place the meat and skin on a cutting board and finely dice. Transfer to the bowl of aromatics and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Your filling is finished, and you're ready to make dumplings!

**Fold the dumplings:**

1. First, get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation.
2. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the dumpling wrapper.
3. Wet the edges with water and fold the dumpling in half. Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling closed into a half-moon shape.
4. You can crimp and pinch the edges as you seal it, but it takes practice!

**Steam, pan-fry, or deep fry the dumplings:**

1. To steam: fill your steamer pot with water and place the rack on top. Place a liner on top. Bring the water to a boil and arrange the dumplings on top. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and steam for 10 minutes.
2. To pan-fry: Dip the bottoms of the dumplings into the water just to coat the bottom, then dip into a bowl of sesame seeds to evenly coat the bottom. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high. Add the dumplings, sesame seed side down, and cook without moving for 1 minute. Pour in ¼ cup water and cover immediately. Cook for 3–4 minutes. Remove the lid and fry for an additional minute or so.
3. To deep-fry: Heat a few inches of oil in a large pot until the oil reaches 330ºF. Add dumplings in batches and deep-fry for 3–4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

12blose,Duck Breast with Mushrooms and Pearl Onions,2197,26,1680620384.0,0.97,Poultry,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/9u3qdq9otvra1.jpg,"**Recipe + more photos here originally:** [**My Favorite Duck Breast Recipe**](https://newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com/p/my-favorite-duck-breast-recipe)

**A quick tip:**

Typically, you need to only boil pearl onions for 2 minutes. I go a little longer to soften them a bit more so I don't have to sauté them quite as long since you're holding the duck. BUT! If you don't mind dirtying another skillet, feel free to start those mushrooms and onions in a separate skillet as you cook the duck.

Seared duck breast:

* 1 duck breast (1 pound)
* Salt and pepper to taste

Mushrooms and pearl onions:

* 8 ounces gold or white pearl onions
* 12 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons reserved duck fat
* 3 sprigs thyme
* 4 garlic cloves peeled and thinly sliced
* 1 tablespoon freshly minced parsley, plus more for garnish
* Salt and pepper to taste

Sweet potato puree:

* 2 sweet potatoes, about 1 pound, peeled and cubed
* 2 tablespoons butter
* ½ cup whole milk plus more, if needed
* 2 tablespoons sour cream
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper flakes or paprika and a pinch of crushed red pepper
* Salt and pepper to taste

Parboil and peel the pearl onions:

1. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the pearl onions (skins on) and boil for 5 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl of ice-cold water using a slotted spoon.
2. Once the onions are cool enough to handle, carefully cut off the root end of the onion with sharp scissors. Pop the onion out from its skin. Continue on until all the onions are peeled. Discard the skins.

Cook the sweet potatoes:

1. Dump out the water from the pot and add the sweet potatoes. Cover with fresh water and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20 minutes until fork-tender.
2. Turn off the heat. Pour the potatoes into a colander and return the pot to the same burner. Allow the potatoes to dry off for 1 minute using the residual heat from the warm burner.
3. Add the butter, milk, sour cream, garlic powder, and pepper flakes to the potatoes.
4. Using an immersion blender, blend until creamy and smooth, adding more milk if needed. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder or pepper flakes. Set aside and keep warm.

Cook the duck:

1. Pat the duck dry breast dry. Using a sharp paring knife, score the skin at an angle in ⅛-inch increments until the skin has been completely scored from edge to edge. Be careful not to pierce or cut into the flesh of the duck.
2. Place the duck, skin-side down, into a skillet. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 7 minutes or until the fat begins to render out. Adjust the heat periodically as it cooks. You want to stay somewhere between medium and medium-low.
3. If your duck breast is unevenly fatty (for example, the ends may have a thicker fat layer than the middle of the breast), use a small cast-iron press or skillet or a metal flipper to press that part of the duck into the skillet to encourage even browning.
4. After 7 minutes, get the heat back to medium or just slightly above. The fat in the skillet may begin bubbling and sputtering a bit more rapidly. Check the skin and continue frying and adjusting the heat until the skin is deep golden brown and crisp. This may take another 6–8 minutes. Just keep adjusting the heat and peeking at the skin.
5. Flip the duck and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until desired internal temperature is met. For medium-rare, cook the duck to about 130ºF at the thickest part of the breast. Note: Do not take the temperature of the duck through the skin. Pierce the flesh in order to get an accurate temperature read. I prefer to cook the duck until it reaches 135ºF.
6. Transfer the duck to a plate and cover it tightly with foil. Set aside to rest as you finish the rest of the recipe.

Fry the mushrooms and onions:

1. Drain all the duck fat into a heat-proof jar through a small sieve. Wipe out the skillet and place it on the stove over medium heat.
2. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes until the mushrooms begin to sweat and take on a bit of color.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved duck fat, pearl onions, and thyme sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes until the pearl onions are fork-tender and golden around the edges.
4. Stir in the minced garlic and fresh parsley and sauté for 1 minute. Turn off the heat.

To serve:

1. Right before serving, remove the foil from the duck and slice it crosswise.
2. Spoon the sweet potatoes into a rimmed plate and pile on the mushrooms and onions. Arrange a few slices of duck on each plate. Garnish with more parsley and Aleppo pepper flakes if you like.

**Cooking Tips for Massaman Curry:**

Use high-quality ingredients - Massaman curry relies on the flavour of the curry paste, so make sure to use a good-quality one.

Toast the spices - Toasting the spices, such as cinnamon, cumin, and coriander, before adding them to the curry will enhance their flavour and aroma.

Brown the meat - If you're using meat, such as beef or chicken, brown it first to seal in the juices and enhance the flavour.

Use coconut cream - Coconut cream is richer and thicker than coconut milk, and it gives the curry a creamy texture and flavour.

Add peanuts - Traditional massaman curry often includes peanuts, which add a crunchy texture and nutty flavour to the dish. You can also use cashews or almonds.

Don't overcook the vegetables - To retain their texture and nutrients, don't overcook the vegetables. Add them towards the end of cooking and cook just until they're tender.

Adjust the seasoning - Taste the curry as you cook it and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may need to add more salt, sugar, or fish sauce to balance the flavours.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11nwlxk/chicken_massaman_curry/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11nwlxk/chicken_massaman_curry/
11j9z06,Spicy Duck Egg Rolls,1041,21,1678045387.0,0.98,Poultry,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/puv5yzhv4zla1.jpg,"**Recipe and more photos here originally:** [**Duck Egg Roll Recipe**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/duck-egg-rolls/)

**Roast duck:**

* 4 or 5-pound duck; giblets, neck, and feet reserved for another use
* 2 clementines, quartered, optional
* 2 small shallots, peeled and quartered, optional
* Salt and pepper

**Filling:**

* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded and caps small-diced
* 1 shallot, peeled and minced
* 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and minced
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2 scallions, trimmed and minced
* 1–2 Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced
* 1–2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
* 2 teaspoons sweet chili sauce or teriyaki sauce
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon Chinese Five Spice, plus more to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
* Salt, if needed

**Egg rolls:**

* Vegetable oil
* 10–12 egg roll wrappers
* Thinly sliced scallions

**Prepare the duck:**

1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF.
2. Line a roasting pan with foil. Place a raised rack in the pan and set aside.
3. Pat the duck dry and season it all over with salt and pepper.
4. Stuff the cavity with quartered clementines and shallots. Using kitchen twine, tie the legs together.

**Roast the duck:**

1. Place the duck on top of the raised rack and transfer it to the oven for 2 hours.
2. Remove the duck from the oven. Using a sharp knife, create a few shallow slits in the skin across the breast and around the thighs. This will allow the fat to fully render. Be careful not to cut the meat too much. You just need 6–8 slits all over the duck, particularly around the fatty area of the legs and breasts.
3. Return the duck to the oven for 1 hour.
4. Remove the duck from the oven and let cool as you prepare the filling.

**Cook the filling:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, minced shallot, ginger, garlic, scallions, and minced Thai chili peppers. Cook for 6–7 minutes, turning occasionally until the mushrooms are golden brown. Turn off the heat and transfer to a large bowl.

**Prepare the filling:**

1. To the bowl of aromatics, add the hoisin sauce, sweet chili sauce, soy sauce, Chinese Five Spice, and white pepper. Toss to combine. Set aside.

**Shred the duck:**

1. Once the duck is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones. Avoid any meat that feels very sinewy. You can keep as much of the skin as you like for the egg rolls, particularly the skin around the breasts, thighs, and legs. I discard the skin on the back of the duck. Reserve the carcass for stock, if you like.
2. Place the meat and skin on a cutting board and finely dice. Transfer to the bowl of aromatics and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.

**Heat the oil:**

1. Heat 2–3 inches of oil in a wide pot until it reaches 325ºF.

**Roll the egg rolls:**

1. First, get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation.
2. Place the egg roll wrapper on a plate and rotate it so that it’s a diamond.
3. Place two tablespoons or so of filling in the middle of the wrapper.
4. Lift up the bottom corner of the diamond (the corner closest to you) and fold it over the filling. Use your fingers to pinch the wrapper over the filling tightly.
5. Fold the left and right corners over the filling. The wrapper will look like an envelope now.
6. Roll the mixture toward the top corner one rotation. You should have a small triangle sticking out at the top.
7. Dip your fingers into the water and wet the edges of the remaining corner (imagine you’re sealing an envelope!). Roll the filling one more rotation to seal the egg roll. Dip your fingers back into the water and brush the corner once more to completely seal the egg roll.
8. Continue on until all the egg rolls are rolled.\*

**Fry the egg rolls:**

1. Once the oil is hot, begin frying the egg rolls in batches for 2–4 minutes or until the wrapper is golden brown and crispy. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

**To serve:**

1. Place the egg rolls on a serving platter with thinly sliced scallions. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy!

*Note: If you don’t think you can eat all of them in one sitting, place as many un-fried egg rolls as you’d like to freeze on a baking sheet. Transfer to the freezer for 4 hours. Remove from the freezer and place in a freezer bag. Return to the freezer. They will keep for up to 6 months and can be baked, deep-fried, or air-fried whenever you want them!*",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11j9z06/spicy_duck_egg_rolls/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11j9z06/spicy_duck_egg_rolls/

**Sauce:**

* 4 ounces fresh squeezed orange juice
* 2 teaspoons orange zest
* 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 4 tablespoons light brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon chili oil, optional
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch

**Chicken:**

* 2–3 tablespoons neutral oil
* 1½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized cubes
* 3 tablespoons cornstarch
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon white pepper

**Aromatics:**

* 2 teaspoons neutral oil, as needed, divided
* 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, caps sliced and stems discarded
* 2 teaspoons freshly minced ginger
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2–3 bird’s eye chilies, trimmed and minced
* 2 scallions, minced

**For serving:**

* Sliced scallion greens, crispy shallots, or sesame seeds
* Cooked white rice

**Prepare all the ingredients:**

1. Before beginning, prepare all of the fresh ingredients and have them ready

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Place all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl and whisk until the cornstarch is completely incorporated into the liquid and no lumps remain. Set aside.

**Prepare the chicken:**

1. Place a skillet on the stovetop over medium heat. Add the neutral oil and allow it to heat as you prepare the chicken.
2. Put the diced chicken in a bowl and season it with salt and white pepper. Sprinkle the cornstarch on top and use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to mix until all the chicken is coated.
3. Turn the heat on the skillet to medium-high. Once the oil is hot and shimmering in the skillet, arrange a batch of the chicken in an even layer, ensuring that the chicken isn’t crowded. Cook for 4–6 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a bowl and continue cooking the chicken in batches until all of the chicken is fried.

**Cook the mushrooms:**

1. If the pot is dry, add 1 teaspoon neutral oil. Add the mushrooms and season all over with salt. Cook for 4–5 minutes until they are a light golden brown all over. Shiitakes dry out very quickly, so be sure not to cook them too long! Transfer them to the bowl of cooked chicken.

**Sauté the aromatics:**

1. Heat the remaining 1 teaspoon oil in the skillet. Add the minced ginger, garlic, chili peppers, and scallions. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Cook the sauce:**

1. Pour in the sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often, for 3–5 minutes until the sauce becomes very thick. If it begins to stick, reduce the heat to low.

**Sauce the chicken:**

1. Pour the cooked chicken and mushrooms into the sauce and toss to coat. Continue tossing over low heat for 2–3 minutes until the chicken is completely coated and the sauce thickens a bit more. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings if needed. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the chicken over cooked white rice. Garnish with sliced scallions, crispy shallots, or sesame seeds. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11g7ybp/spicy_orange_chicken_and_mushrooms/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11g7ybp/spicy_orange_chicken_and_mushrooms/

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1.5 pounds chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch cubes

Marinade

* 1 tbsp five-spice powder
* 2 tbsp light soy sauce
* 3 cloves of garlic, finely minced
* ½ tsp white pepper
* 1/8 tsp black pepper
* ½ tsp salt
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 2 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp Shaoxing cooking wine
* 1 egg (whites only)

For frying

* ½ cup cornstarch
* ½ cup potato starch or tapioca starch
* 1 cup of Thai Basil
* Oil (vegetable, canola, peanut or grapeseed)

Seasoning powder

* ½ tsp five-spice powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp white pepper

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. **Trim fat and cut to size.** This is an optional step. Trim some of the fat off the chicken thighs. If you prefer a juicier fried chicken you can leave it on. Cut the chicken thighs into 1-inch pieces.
2. **Marinade.** In a medium bowl combine the chicken thigh pieces, five spice, light soy sauce, minced garlic, white pepper, black pepper, salt, sesame oil, sugar, egg white and Shaoxing cooking wine. Mix until all the chicken thigh pieces are well coated. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour. Overnight is recommended so the flavor is absorbed into the meat.
3. **Combine the seasoning powder.** Combine the five-spice, salt, white pepper and Sichuan peppercorns. Set aside.
4. **Coat the chicken thighs.** Combine the cornstarch and potato or tapioca starch on a shallow plate. Dredge the marinaded chicken thighs. Be generous with coating the pieces so you can get an extra crispy piece when fried.
5. **Heat the oil.** Take a pan and add the oil and bring it to 350 Degrees F. I leave it at medium-high heat.
6. **Deep fry.** In small batches add the pieces slowly without splashing the oil. Do not overcrowd or your chicken will not crisp up resulting in limp and super oily popcorn chicken. Fry for 4-5 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Removed with a slotted spoon and let the oil drip. Either use a paper towel or a rack to let it cool. Repeat this 2-3 times.
7. **Double fry (Optional Step).** Once all the chicken pieces have been deep fry. Double fry to get a crispier chicken. Toss the chicken in the batch and deep fry for 2 minutes. Do not overcook otherwise it may burn.
8. **Deep fry Thai Basil.** Take the basil and toss it into the hot oil. Deep fry for 15-20 seconds or until they are crispy and still green. Remove with a slotted spoon and place them on top of a paper towel to absorb most of the oil.
9. **Coat with seasoning powder.** Toss the fried popcorn chicken in a large bowl and coat them with the seasoning powder. Add as much or as little of the seasoning mix.
10. **Plate and top with fried Thai basil.** Plate the fried chicken and top it with the fried thai basil. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11a1ty0/taiwanese_popcorn_chicken/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11a1ty0/taiwanese_popcorn_chicken/

**Ingredients for Marry Me Chicken:**

\* 3 medium-sized chicken breasts, each breast sliced into cutlets

\* 100g (3.5oz) of plain flour (in the bowl)

\* 10 cherry tomatoes, sliced in half

\* 150g (5.3oz) of sun-dried tomatoes, finely diced

\* 2tbsp of olive oil (you can use oil from sun-dried tomatoes)

\* 30g (1oz) of butter

\* 4 garlic cloves, finely diced

\* 200ml (0.21quarts) of veg stock

\* 300ml (0.31quarts) of heavy cream

\* 30g (1oz) of grated parmesan cheese (plus 10g more for garnish)

\* 1tsp tomato paste

\* 1tbsp oregano

\* fresh basil, a few leaves for garnish

\* salt &amp; black pepper to taste

\* 1tsp of chilli flakes (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Marry Me Chicken:**

**1.** Preheat the oven to 140C (284F) and place sliced cherry tomatoes on the tray, drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper. Slow-roast for 45 minutes.

**2.** Season sliced chicken breast with a little bit of salt and coat them in plain flour. Transfer them to a plate but do not stack as they will stick together.

**3.** Preheat the frying pan and add olive oil and butter. Once butter melts, pan-fry chicken breasts on medium-high heat until both sides are golden brown (I had to do it in three batches). When ready transfer the chicken onto a plate. Keep covered with another plate and set aside.

**4.** Sauté the diced garlic for a minute and add veg stock, give it a stir to remove any bits stuck to a pan. Next, add heavy cream and parmesan cheese. Simmer for 2 minutes then mix in 1tsp of tomato puree, season with oregano and chilli.

**5.** Add chopped sun-dried tomatoes and the chicken, simmer for a few minutes or until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper to your taste.

**6.** Garnish with semi-dried cherry tomatoes, fresh basil leaves and sprinkle with parmesan. Enjoy with pasta, rice or pearl barley.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10ua6iz/marry_me_chicken/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/10ua6iz/marry_me_chicken/

*Time:* 40 mins

*Original Recipe:* [https://craftycookbook.com/marry-me-chicken-tortellini/](https://craftycookbook.com/marry-me-chicken-tortellini/)

Note, I didn't name this dish. ""Marry Me Chicken"" has been around for a while, it always features pan fried chicken breast served in a sun dried tomato cream sauce. This version serves it up over tortellini tossed in extra sauce.

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast
* 16-20 oz fresh or frozen cheese tortellini
* 2 cups half-and-half, or 1 cup cream + 1 cup whole milk
* 1 ½ tsp chicken better than bouillon, or chicken bouillon cubes
* ⅓ cup sun dried tomatoes, drained and chopped fine
* ½ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, or sub basil or parsley
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* ¼ cup all-purpose flour
* ½ tsp crushed red pepper flakes (add more to make it spicy, or omit if very sensitive to spice)
* ½ tsp dried oregano
* olive oil
* garlic powder
* freshly cracked black pepper
* salt

**Instructions**

1. Fillet the chicken breast(s) and pound to a thin, even thickness. Season all over with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Pour flour onto a shallow plate and dredge the chicken in it, shaking off any excess.
2. Warm 2 tbsp olive oil over medium high heat, sear breasts for about 3 mins per side, until golden, then remove to a cutting board. Slice into the largest piece to ensure it’s cooked through, then tent with foil to keep warm. Do not wipe the pan clean. Turn off the heat to allow the pan to cool slightly.
3. Meanwhile, begin boiling a large pot of salted water. Cook the tortellini per package instructions while preparing the rest of the meal. Drain and cover to keep warm until needed. (Most cook times are short, so wait until the sauce is almost done)
4. In the pan you cooked the chicken, cook the garlic and red pepper flakes over medium heat until fragrant (about 1 minute), add more oil if needed.  Next, add the half-and-half and reduce heat to medium low. Add the bouillon and oregano, mix well and scrape any browned bits into the sauce. Once simmering, add the parmesan (reserving a little for garnish) and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is the consistency of thick cream, about 10 minutes.
5. After simmering, add the chopped sun dried tomatoes and mix well. Add the chicken back to the pan and spoon sauce over it until it’s coated. Warm it in the pan for 1-2 minutes, then remove to a cutting board and cut into bite sized pieces.
6. Toss the tortellini in the sauce, then plate into serving dishes. Top with the chicken, then garnish with the reserved parmesan and fresh thyme.

I don't *think* chicken cacciatore usually has cheese on it, but growing up, my dad always made his cacciatore with slices of provolone. I made this recipe with him in mind :)

* Prep Time: 20 minutes
* Cook Time: 35 minutes
* Inactive time: 1 hour
* Total Time: 1 hour 50 minutes
* Servings: 6
* Calories: 451kcal

**Ingredients:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 3 carrots, peeled and diced
* 8 ounces button mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon dry oregano
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 10-ounce jar roasted red peppers, drained and sliced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* ½ cup red wine
* 14.5- ounce can cherry or whole peeled tomatoes
* 28- ounce can crushed tomatoes
* ½ cup chicken stock or water
* Pinch of sugar, optional
* 6- ounce jar pitted Castelvetrano olives, drained and torn in half
* 8-ounce ball fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced into rounds
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Salt and pepper to taste
* For serving:
* Cooked pappardelle pasta
* Minced parsley

**Instructions:**

**Fry the chicken:**

1. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Heat the 1 tablespoon of neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the chicken thighs, in batches if needed, skin-side down. Cook without moving for 5 minutes or until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the bottom of the pot. Flip and cook for 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Keep the pot on medium-high heat.

**Cook the aromatics:**

1. Add the diced onion, carrots, and sliced mushrooms to the pot. Cook, stirring regularly, for 8–10 minutes. Season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Melt the butter into the pot and add the garlic, dry thyme, dry oregano, and crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the red bell peppers and cook for 1 minute.

**Brown the tomato paste:**

1. Add the tomato paste to the pot. Cook, stirring and mashing the paste into the pot, for 3–4 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium as needed to prevent it from burning. The paste will sizzle, deepen in color, and stick to the bottom of the pot.
2. Pour the wine into the pot and bring it to a boil. Stir to lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot.

**Simmer the sauce:**

1. Add both cans of tomatoes along with the chicken stock or water. Add a pinch of sugar if you like. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, taste the sauce, and add a pinch of salt and pepper if needed. Add the chicken to the pot, spooning the sauce so that it completely covers the chicken.
2. Cover the pot and simmer on low heat for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to ensure that the sauce isn't sticking.
3. After 30 minutes, remove the lid and add the torn olives, stirring them into the sauce. Cover and simmer for an additional 10–20 minutes.

**Finish the chicken cacciatore:**

1. Turn on the broiler. Remove the lid from the pot. Arrange the sliced mozzarella on top and drizzle with a teaspoon or two of extra virgin olive oil. Transfer to the broiler for 2–4 minutes or until the cheese is browned and bubbly. Turn off the broiler and remove the pot from the oven.

**To serve:**

1. Sprinkle the chicken and sauce with freshly minced parsley. Serve with pasta or crusty bread. Enjoy!

Original recipe: [https://craftycookbook.com/healthy-takeout-style-velvet-chicken/](https://craftycookbook.com/healthy-takeout-style-velvet-chicken/) 

Time: 30 mins

Please note, there are multiple methods for ""velveting"" chicken, which tenderizes the meat. This method uses baking soda. This process is optional but recommended. 

**Ingredients**

* 1 lbs chicken breast
* 3 cups broccoli florets
* 1 8oz can of water chestnuts, drained and rinsed (optional)
* 3 green onions, greens sliced thin
* 2 tsp baking soda
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* salt
* fresh cracked black pepper

*For Sauce:*

* ½ cup chicken broth, can sub water
* 2 tbsp mirin, Japanese sweet cooking wine
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
* 2 tbsp cornstarch
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic

**Instructions**

1. Slice the chicken breast into \~¼” thick slices. Arrange the sliced chicken on a cutting board or plate so it’s laying flat. Dust with 1 tsp of baking soda, then flip all the pieces and dust with the other 1 tsp of baking soda. Let sit for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, rinse the baking soda off of the chicken with water then thoroughly pat dry (This is what tenderizes the chicken and gives it the unique texture). Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.
2. While waiting on the chicken, mix together the chicken stock and cornstarch in small bowl, then add in the other sauce ingredients and mix well. The oyster sauce may not fully incorporate, that’s okay it will in the pan.
3. Once the chicken is prepared, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and try to arrange it such that the pieces lay flat in the pan. Cook until golden on one side (2-3 minutes), then mix the chicken around in the pan and cook until cooked through (another \~90 seconds).
4. Push the chicken to the sides of the pan and add the broccoli to the center. Cook for about one minute, then add the water chestnuts and cook for another minute. Add more oil to the pan if needed.
5. Next, lower the heat slightly and add the sauce. Cook everything together for another \~2 minutes until the sauce has reduced and evenly coated everything. Remove from heat and add in the chopped green onion, serve immediately over a bed of white rice.

This recipe is perfect for meal prepping, I recommend making a large batch to use throughout the week or freeze for later. Recommend prep is in a smoker, but it also works great in the oven.

Makes: 20 6oz portions (315 cal per serving)

Original recipe: [https://craftycookbook.com/dry-rub-bbq-chicken-breast/](https://craftycookbook.com/dry-rub-bbq-chicken-breast/)

**Ingredients**

* 10 lbs large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or make a smaller batch)

*For dry rub:*

* ½ cup dark brown sugar
* ¼ cup kosher salt
* 2 tbsp garlic powder
* 1 tbsp black pepper
* 1 tbsp onion powder
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika
* 1 tbsp chili powder, add more for extra spice

**Instructions**

1. Begin preheating a smoker or the oven to 250° F. If preparing in the oven, line a baking sheet with foil then place a wire rack on it, lightly spray with oil (will need 2X if cooking 10 lbs of chicken).
2. Mix together all of the dry rub ingredients and set aside.
3. Trim any excess fat off the chicken breasts, then dust them with the dry rub. Use clean hands to rub the dry rub into the meat, flip and repeat with the other side, so the chicken is fully coated. The dry rub should stick to the meat without needing any additional binders.
4. Place the chicken breast in the smoker or oven and cook until the chicken reaches an internal temp of 165° F in the thickest portion. Use a leave-in meat thermometer to monitor the temperature, if you have one. For large breasts this should take 1 to 1.5 hours in the oven, or 1 to 2 hours in a smoker. If you don’t have a meat thermometer available, slice into one of the breasts to make sure it’s cooked through.
5. Once the chicken is cooked through, cut the breasts into small cubes on a large cutting board then gently shred the meat. The breasts should have a tough outer skin and tender, juicy center.

*To Freeze*

* Separate into the portions you expect to use at a time (I use 10-12 oz per meal for two adults). Seal these portions in a freezer-safe zip bag with the air pressed out, or vacuum seal if you’re able to. Place the packets in the freezer until ready to use.

*To Reheat*

* Place the sealed bag of frozen chicken in a bowl of cool water, let it sit until it's mostly defrosted, about 20 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a microwave safe container and warm in the microwave, tossing every 30 seconds, until heated through.

*To Use*

* There are endless possibilities for what you can add this chicken to! Here are my favorite uses: loaded grilled cheese sandwiches, quesadillas, on pizza, on pasta, on salads, and in soup!

Time: \~30 mins

Nutrition: \~1640 kcal per batch

Original Recipe: [https://craftycookbook.com/coconut-lime-chicken-pasta/](https://craftycookbook.com/coconut-lime-chicken-pasta/)

**Ingredients**

* 1 large chicken breast, \~12-16 oz
* 8 oz thin spaghetti or similar
* 2 tbsp coconut oil or olive oil
* 2 tbsp fresh cilantro, for topping
* 1 tsp baking soda, optional, for tenderizing
* salt
* black pepper

*For Sauce*

* 1 13.5 oz can lite coconut milk, unsweetened (\~1 ½ cup)
* ¼ cup fresh lime juice, juice of 1 large or 2 small limes
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 1 tsp chicken better than bouillon or 1 chicken bouillon cube
* 1 tbsp cornstarch
* 1/4 tsp black pepper

**Instructions**

1. Fillet the chicken breast and pound the pieces to an even thickness. \[Optionally, tenderize the chicken with baking soda. Dust the baking soda lightly over both sides of the fillets. Let sit for 15 minutes, then rinse off all the baking soda and pat dry with paper towels.\] Season the chicken all over with salt and black pepper.
2. Mix together the sauce ingredients and set aside.
3. Begin boiling a large pot of salted water for the pasta as you prep other ingredients. Boil pasta per package instructions for al dente, then drain a set aside, keep covered. (I typically add the pasta to the water during step 5)
4. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté the chicken until each side has some browning and the chicken is cooked through or mostly cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a cutting board.
5. Carefully wipe the skillet clean of excess oil, then add the coconut milk mixture. Once it’s boiling reduce heat to medium low, add the chicken back to the pan let simmer for \~5 minutes, occasionally spooning the sauce over the chicken. Remove the chicken back to the cutting board and ensure it’s cooked through. Allow the chicken to rest, and continue to reduce the sauce until it’s thick enough that a spatula pushed through the sauce briefly leaves streaks in the pan, about 5 minutes.
6. Once the sauce is ready, remove from heat and reserve about 2 tbsp (for topping the chicken). Toss the pasta in the remainder of the sauce. Plate the pasta, and top with the chicken sliced into bite sized pieces. Top the chicken with the remaining sauce and garnish the whole dish with the cilantro.

Tender shredded chicken coated in incredibly flavorful spicy feta sauce, paired with tangy lemon rice. (Note, this is not authentic Greek lemon rice)

Time: 40 mins

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast
* ⅔ cup chicken stock
* olive oil
* salt
* fresh cracked black pepper
* red pepper flakes, optional, for topping
* \~1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, optional, for topping

*For Feta Sauce:*

* 4 oz feta
* 1 small shallot, chopped
* ¼ cup roasted red bell peppers, chopped (I use jarred peppers)
* ½ tbsp freshly minced garlic
* ½ tbsp red wine vinegar
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp chicken stock or water
* ¼ tsp cayenne powder + more to taste
* ⅛ tsp salt
* ⅛ tsp black pepper

*For Lemon Rice:*

* 2 cups jasmine rice
* 3 cups chicken stock
* 2 large lemons zested and juiced
* 2 tbsp butter
* salt to taste

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions - Spicy Feta Chicken**

1. Trim any excess fat and gently pound the chicken breast(s) to an even thickness. Season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Warm a drizzle of olive oil over medium-high heat in a pan that has a lid. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken and cook for about 3 minutes per side until golden. Add the ⅔ cup chicken stock to the pan and close with the lid. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for another \~10 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked through.
3. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Combine the spicy feta sauce ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. Taste and add more cayenne to make it as spicy as you’d like (if you are very sensitive to spice, start with ⅛ tsp rather than ¼ tsp cayenne or omit completely).
4. When the chicken is ready, allow it to rest for a few minutes then shred it (I use two forks to shred chicken breast). Toss the chicken in the sauce until its fully coated, you may not want to use all the sauce so add a little at a time.
5. Optionally, top with red pepper flakes and/or fresh thyme when serving.

**Instructions - Lemon Rice**

1. Thoroughly rinse the rice until the water runs clear (even if the rice says “pre-washed”). In a medium stockpot combine the rice, chicken stock, and half of the lemon juice.
2. Close the pot with a lid and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes, then reduce the heat to low so the rice is simmering and cook until the water is all gone, about 10 minutes. Set heat to low to keep warm until ready to serve.
3. Before serving, add the lemon zest, the rest of the lemon juice, butter, and a dash of salt. Mix well, then serve.

### Instructions

#### Make the meatballs:

* Mix together the egg and milk until smooth. Add the panko and stir to combine. Let stand 5 minutes. Add the turkey and all the spices. Mix together with your hands until combined. If the mixture is too loose, add more panko in 1/4 cup increments. The mixture should be sticky, but rollable.
* Tip: Microwave or fry up a small piece of the mixture and taste a bit and then adjust the seasonings before rolling the meatballs.
* Roll the meatballs into tablespoon-sized balls.

* Place a large pot on the stove over medium-high heat. Add the butter. Once melted, add the diced onion and cook until translucent. Add the rinsed rice and cook 1–2 minutes. Pour the saffron-water mixture on top and then add the remaining water. Season it with salt and then bring to a low boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes or until the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and let the rice rest for 5–10 minutes.

#### Prepare the zucchini-cucumber salad:

* Add the diced zucchini, cucumber, and shallot to a bowl. Add extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and dry dill. Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.

#### Prepare the hummus sauce:

* Whisk together the hummus, lemon juice, and chili flakes until smooth. Taste and add salt if needed. Add a few splashes of water until the hummus reaches drizzling consistency. Set aside.

#### To serve:

* Divide the rice between bowls. Pile the meatballs on top and add a spoonful of salad to each bowl. Serve with a spoonful of the hummus sauce and toasted pita, if you like. Enjoy!

t5y33a,Creamy Chicken Pasta Recipe,1708,23,1646331819.0,0.98,Poultry,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/inphgpw3o7l81.jpg,"**Recipe here originally: [Creamy Chicken Pasta Recipe](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/creamy-chicken-pasta-recipe/)**

This creamy chicken pasta recipe is a rich, comforting creamy chicken pasta with vegetables like Brussels sprouts and roasted red bell peppers.

This creamy chicken pasta recipe can be made in a few different ways:

* Raw split chicken breasts that you turn into a homemade chicken stock
* Leftover shredded chicken from a homemade or store-bought roasted chicken
* Raw, boneless chicken that you simply chop up and sauté until cooked through before starting the sauce

For the recipe below, I used raw split chicken breasts that I turned into very simple chicken stock. However, this does add more time to the recipe. If you’re in a pinch and you have leftover shredded chicken already, you can skip the steps for making the stock and move right into the sauce preparation.

**What you need:**

For this recipe, you’ll primarily need chicken, pasta, vegetables, and heavy cream. Take a look at some of my substitution suggestions so you can modify this dish any way you like:

* **Chicken:** Omit for vegetarian. You could also use shrimp but you would skip baking the dish to avoid overcooking them.
* **Brussels sprouts:** Use your favorite vegetables in this meal! Try it with zucchini, broccoli or broccolini, cauliflower florets, eggplant, or use spinach.
* **Roasted red bell peppers:** Chopped sun-dried tomatoes

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 30 minutes

Inactive Time: 1 hour

Total Time: 1 hour 45 minutes 

Servings: 6 

Calories: 762kcal

### Equipment

* Large pot
* Baking sheet
* Wide ovenproof pot
* Sieve
* Tongs

### Ingredients

#### Chicken stock (optional):

* 1 pound bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts
* 1 yellow onion quartered, paper left on
* 1 head of garlic halved, paper left on
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Creamy chicken pasta:

* 16 ounces pasta of your choice like strozzapreti, rigatoni, penne, rotini, or fusilli
* 2 tablespoons neutral oil
* 2 red bell peppers trimmed, seeded, and quartered
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 1 pound Brussels sprouts halved
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more if desired
* ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
* 1½ cups homemade chicken stock from above or use store-bought stock
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Freshly minced parsley optional, for garnish

### Instructions

#### Prepare the stock:

* Cover split chicken breasts with water and season liberally with salt. Add the quartered onion and halved head of garlic. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 30–40 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Skim off the foam that floats to the top as the chicken cooks.
* Use tongs to transfer the chicken to a plate and let it cool. Bring the stock back to a boil and boil for 15 minutes until significantly reduced. Strain through a sieve into a large bowl and set aside. You will need 1½ cups stock for the recipe, and any extra stock can be saved for another use.
* Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred it with your fingers, two forks, or dice it up. Discard the skin and bones.
* Wipe out the pot used for the stock and fill it back up with salted water and return it to the stovetop. You'll use it for the pasta later on.

#### Broil the red bell peppers:

* While the stock cooks, prepare the red bell peppers. Arrange the prepared peppers on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Place under a broiler and cook for 7–8 minutes until blackened all over. Keep an eye on them, so they don't burn to a crisp!
* Immediately transfer the peppers to a Tupperware dish with a lid or a gallon freezer bag. The trapped steam will help the skins come off easily. Peel the peppers and roughly chop and set aside.
* Turn the broiler off and turn the oven's heat to 400ºF.

#### Cook the pasta:

* Bring the pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until 2 minutes under al dente. Drain and set aside.

#### Cook the vegetables:

* In a wide, oven-proof pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Cook the onion until softened–about 7–10 minutes–and then turn the heat to high. Add the Brussels sprouts and cook for 6 minutes until well-charred. Add the chopped red peppers and cook for 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl.

#### Prepare the sauce:

* Melt the butter in the pot over medium heat. Once bubbly, add dry thyme and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add flour to the butter and cook for 2–3 minutes until lightly golden. Slowly whisk in the reserved chicken stock. Bring to a low boil and then reduce heat and continue whisking until completely smooth.
* Stir in the heavy cream and whisk until smooth. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and more crushed red pepper if you like. Turn off the heat.

#### Bake the pasta:

* To the sauce, add the cooked chicken, cooked pasta, and the reserved vegetables and toss to coat and evenly distribute the ingredients. Sprinkle the parmesan cheese on top and transfer to the oven for 10–15 minutes or until the Brussels sprouts are fork-tender and the cheese is melted. If you like, broil for 2–3 minutes to char the top of the pasta.

#### To serve:

* Garnish the pasta with fresh minced parsley and serve immediately. Enjoy!

**Want to make some substitutions? Here’s my handy guide:**

* **Raw chicken:** In a pinch for time? Use a storebought rotisserie chicken and storebought stock.
* **Carrots, celery, and onions:** Use any combination of aromatics. If you don’t have celery, use more carrots! You can even add lots of freshly minced garlic or even sliced fennel.
* **Mushrooms:** You can omit them or swap with something else you have in your crisper. Try adding a soup green at the end (like escarole, spinach, or arugula) or you can add some frozen veggies at the end like green beans, corn, or peas!
* **Barley:** Use wild rice, farro, farfalle, egg noodles, or pearl couscous. Cooking time will vary!

This chicken barley soup recipe is comforting and warming with rich homemade chicken stock, lots of aromatics, and mushrooms.

Servings: 8

Calories: 376kcal

## Equipment

* Large stockpot
* Sieve

## Ingredients

## Chicken stock:

* 3- pound whole chicken giblets removed and discarded
* 2 chicken leg quarters optional
* 5 ribs celery with leaves roughly chopped
* 3 carrots scrubbed and cut into thirds
* 1 onion with paper quartered
* 2 dry bay leaves
* 1 bunch parsley torn or cut in half
* Salt and pepper
* Water

## Chicken barley soup:

* 1 tablespoon oil for sautéing
* 7 ounces mushrooms of choice like beech, cremini, or shiitake, sliced or torn depending on variety
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 4 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and diced
* 5 carrots trimmed, peeled, and diced
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 cup pearl barley
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Fresh minced parsley optional, for serving

## Instructions

## Prepare the chicken stock:

* Place the chicken in a big stockpot with celery, carrots, onion, bay leaves, and parsley. Cover with water and season liberally with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 3–4 hours. Skim off any scum or foam that rises to the top. Let the pot cool and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.

## Finish the chicken stock:

* The next day, remove the chicken from the broth and transfer it to a bowl. Strain the stock through a sieve into a big bowl and discard the solids. Pick the chicken from the bones and discard the skin and carcass. Wipe out the stockpot and return it to the stovetop.

## Prepare the chicken barley soup:

* Once your stock is ready to go, prepare the soup. Heat the neutral oil in the stockpot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook for 8–10 minutes. Add the onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring often, for an additional 8–10 minutes.
* Add the dry thyme, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the reserved stock and chicken meat. Add the barley and then bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 30–45 minutes. If needed, supplement the soup with a bit of water or storebought stock, but you likely won’t need it!

## Finish the soup:

* Once the barley is tender, turn off the heat, taste the soup, and season to your preferences.

## To serve:

* Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with more freshly minced parsley, if you like. Enjoy!

* 4 star anise pods
* ½ cup maple syrup
* 1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard
* 1 teaspoon dijon mustard

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Duck:

* Preheat oven to 350ºF.
* Pat the duck dry and use a sharp knife to create angled slits along the breast. Cut into the fatty parts around where the legs meet the body and between the wings and the body. You just want to make enough slits around the fatty part of the duck skin so that the fat renders out.

#### Stuff the Duck:

* Peel the shallots and quarter. Quarter 4 of the clementines. Stuff the duck with the clementines and shallots and tie the legs together. Season the duck liberally with salt and pepper.

#### Roast the Duck:

* Line a baking sheet with foil and place a raised roasting rack on the foil. Place the duck on top and transfer to the oven, breast-side up, for 1 hour.
* Flip the duck and cook, breast-side down, for 1 more hour.
* Remove the duck from the oven. At this point, you can drain off the duck fat and reserve it for another use.
* Roast the duck, breast-side up for 40 minutes more.

#### Prepare the Glaze:

* In a saucepan, combine the juice of the remaining 4 clementines, maple syrup, 4 star anise pods, and 1 teaspoon dijon mustard. Bring to a boil and whisk until smooth. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat.
* Remove the duck from the oven and brush half the glaze over the duck. Return to the oven for 20 more minutes.
* Brush the duck with the remaining glaze and bake for 10 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil for 4-5 minutes until the skin darkens on top, being careful not to burn the sugars in the glaze.
* *Note: You can reserve a few teaspoons of the sauce and spoon it over the duck at service.*

#### To Serve:

* Remove from oven and serve! Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/r8zycm/orangemaple_roast_duck/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/r8zycm/orangemaple_roast_duck/

It is worth noting that the broth of this recipe combines the protein and aromatics of the chicken-based pho ga with spices traditionally associated with the beef-based pho bo, making it Vietnamese-inspired dish rather than a traditional recipe for pho.

**Ingredients**

Broth:

* 2 tablespoons neutral oil
* 2 onions, skins left on and sliced in half
* 1 thumb-sized piece of ginger, skin left on and thickly sliced
* 8 chicken drumsticks

* 2 limes, cut into 4 wedges each
* Sriracha and hoisin sauces, to taste
* Cilantro leaves, plus option leafy herbs such as mint and Thai basil
* Optional: Thai chilis thinly sliced, to taste

**Directions**

1. Heat oil in pressure cooker on high heat. Add onions and ginger, cut side down, and cook without disturbing until vegetables are well charred, about 5 minutes
2. Add the whole spices to the pot (fennel seeds, coriander seeds, cinnamon, cloves), then add 2L of water along with the chicken, fish sauce, sugar and coriander stems. Seal the pressure cooker and cook on high pressure for 20 minutes. While the broth cooks, soak the rice noodles and prepare the garnishes. Release pressure through valve once the time is up
3. Open the pressure cooker and remove the chicken legs; set those aside. Strain the broth into a clean pot and remove the solids. Taste and add more fish sauce/salt or sugar if needed
4. To serve, place prepared noodles into individual bowls and top with chicken legs, sliced onions and scallions. Top with hot broth. Serve immediately and add herbs, limes, sauces and other garnishes as desired

RECIPE VIDEO LINK - [https://youtu.be/KdF86Mcct1Y](https://youtu.be/KdF86Mcct1Y)

INGREDIENTS: 

1.5 lb chicken (I used with skinless chicken pieces with bones in)  
15 cloves of garlic  
1 inch fresh ginger  
½ cup thick plain yogurt   
2 teaspoons salt   
½ teaspoon sugar  
1 medium size red onion  
1 teaspoon turmeric powder  
1 teaspoon cumin powder   
1/2 teaspoon coriander powder  
1/2 teaspoon chili powder   
2 tablespoon oil  
1 green chili  
1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder   
¼ cup finely chopped cilantro leaves

DIRECTIONS: 

You will use 10 garlic cloves to marinate the chicken. The other 5 will be used while cooking the curry. Grate or pound 10 garlic cloves along with ginger. Slice thinly, the remaining 5 garlic cloves  
   
If you are using chicken drumsticks, make sure to score the meat portion a couple of times.   
In a bowl add the chicken pieces along with yogurt, pounded garlic, ½ teaspoon turmeric and 1 teaspoon salt. Give it a mix nicely to coat all the chicken pieces. Keep it aside for minimum 4 hrs or overnight for maximum flavor blend.   
When you are ready to prepare the chicken curry, place a heavy bottom nonstick pan on the stove at medium heat. Pour the oil along with the sliced garlic, chopped green chili and chopped ginger. As the oil heats up, the garlic will start to sizzle and slowly turn golden brown. Take out some garlic chips to add later in garnish.   
To the wok add the sliced onion. Sprinkle the rest of the salt, sugar and turmeric along with the spices (cumin powder, coriander powder and chili powder). Stir and cook the onion for 3 minutes, or until it’s golden brown.   
Then add the marinated chicken and stir it to incorporate everything. If you are using boneless chicken cubes, it will take 15minutes to cook the chicken. If you use chicken with bones in, then it will take about 20 minutes.   
After 10 minutes of cooking the chicken, it will start to release water. Now depending on how much gravy you want, add water and let it continue cooking.   
Once the chicken is cooked, taste for salt and add any if needed.   
Finally sprinkle finely chopped cilantro leaves, garam masala powder and give it a mix.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/pw9nfs/garlic_chicken_curry/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/pw9nfs/garlic_chicken_curry/

Full recipe: [https://www.theflouredcamera.com/korean-fried-chicken-tacos/](https://www.theflouredcamera.com/korean-fried-chicken-tacos/)

# Ingredients

* 1 lb chicken thigh, cubed
* 2 tbsp rice wine or Shaoxing wine
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* ½ inch ginger, minced
* ¼ tsp salt
* Pepper, to taste
* Neutral oil, fill pot for frying  


**Sauce**

* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp rice vinegar
* 1½ tbsp *gochujang*
* 3 tbsp honey
* 2 tsp sesame oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* ½ inch ginger, minced  


**To assemble**

* 6 corn tortillas, sub flour tortillas
* 1 cup Korean coleslaw
* ½ cup kimchi, cut in bite-sized pieces
* Lime
* White sesame seeds, optional
* Kewpie mayo, optional  


# Instructions

1. Make your slaw first and let it sit in the fridge for two hours. Follow my Korean coleslaw recipe.
2. Slice chicken thigh into bite-sized pieces. Marinade in rice wine, salt, pepper, garlic, and ginger for 30 minutes.
3. In a pan, mix ingredients for the sauce on low-medium heat. Allow it to bubble and simmer until thick, keep stirring during the process. This should take about 4-5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit on the side.
4. Coat chicken with corn starch. However, only coat what you will fry immediately. If you let the chicken sit too long in the starch, it will become a sludge.
5. In a shallow pot, add in a neutral flavored oil. Ensure the oil is hot (350° F) before you drop in your chicken. Cook in separate batches. Don't crowd the chicken as it will cause the temperature to drop too quickly and you won't get a nice brown outer layer. Fry each batch for 3 minutes.
6. After each batch, remove chicken with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to absorb some of the oil.
7. Once all the chicken has been fried a first time, put all the chicken back in for a second fry. No need to do this in batches. Fry for about 2 minutes.
8. Heat up the sweet and spicy sauce and add in the fried chicken. Mix well so each piece is evenly coated.
9. Heat up tortillas on a griddle of a pan until softened. Add chicken and top with coleslaw, kimchi, and white sesame seeds (optional). For some creaminess, use a light drizzle of mayo (optional).",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/pu54i9/korean_fried_chicken_tacos/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/pu54i9/korean_fried_chicken_tacos/

This delicious sweet and savory breakfast sandwich is air fried and uses Greek yogurt dough which keeps the fat grams at a reasonable level while also bumping up the protein.

**For the Greek Yogurt Dough**  
•	120 grams All purpose flour  
•	235 grams 0% Fat Plain Greek Yogurt  
•	2 teaspoons baking powder  
•	1/2 teaspoon salt  
•	garlic powder (optional, but great added flavor)  
•	onion powder (optional, but great added flavor)  
•	1 egg white (if using carton egg whites, use \~30g)

**For the chicken and hot honey**  
•	2 boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 400g)  
•	1/3 cup your favorite hot sauce  
•	1/4 cup Panko breadcrumbs (about 22g)  
•	1 teaspoon garlic powder  
•	1 teaspoon onion powder  
•	1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)  
•	1 tablespoon honey  
•	2 teaspoons red pepper flake (adjust to taste)  


**Instructions**  
1.	Preheat oven to 425F  
2.	In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine flour, baking powder, salt, and optional onion powder/garlic powder. Whisk to combine dry ingredients.  
3.	Add in Greek Yogurt  
4.	Use dough hook attachment to knead on medium speed until flour is fully incorporated and dough pulls away from the sides into a ball, about 3 minutes. NOTE: You can do this by hand, it will take about 5 minutes of kneading.  
5.	Flour your hands and divide dough into 4 equal portions.  
6.	Shape into discs and bake on a silicone baking sheet or parchment paper for 12 minutes, rotating your sheet tray halfway through cooking.  
7.	Important – let biscuits cool on the baking sheet 10 minutes before cutting.  
8.	While biscuits are cooling, trim your chicken breasts into \~100g portions.  
9.	Preheat air fryer to 400F. (Note: No air fryer? Chicken can be baked in your oven, at 425F)  
10.	Coat each chicken piece generously with your favorite hot sauce, this is what we’ll use for the breading to stick. If you’d like to cut down on heat, substitute egg white or a whole egg (this will change your end calories/macro split).  
11.	Season panko breadcrumbs with garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and salt.  
12.	Press each chicken piece into seasoned panko, coating both sides with the breadcrumbs.  
13.	Cook chicken pieces in the air fryer for 12 minutes, turning once halfway through cooking. (Using your own? Cook for 16 minutes at 425F, flipping halfway through cooking).  
14.	While chicken is cooking, combine honey and red pepper flake to taste.  
15.	For assembly, split open a biscuit, top with a piece of chicken, drizzle chicken with hot honey and top with other biscuit half.

ntjhoy,Chicken Tandoori with Vegetable Biryani &amp; Cucumber Raita,3382,83,1622978147.0,0.99,Poultry,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/x1uw16mppm371.jpg,"Indian food is so aromatic...  
  
I love the variety of spices used in that cuisine, not to mention their health benefits.  
  
From all the South Asian dishes Chicken Tandoori is definitely one of my favourites, especially when served on fragrant rice like Biryani. Enjoy cooking!  
  
The secret of the best Chicken Tandoori is the meat quality and marinating time.  
  
The longer marinating period the better. It gives the meat enough time to absorb all those beautiful flavours!  
  
Remember to always pick the meat from suppliers that do respect animal welfare, if you cannot afford it try to eat less meat but better sourced.  
  
Making cuts in the meat helps the marinade to penetrate deeper, thus giving a better result.  
  
Serves 3 hungry heads  
  


**Ingredients for Chicken Tandoori:**  
  
3 good quality chicken legs  
  
3 tbsp of natural yoghurt  
  
1/2tsp of salt  
  
half lemon juice and zest  
  
3tsp of garlic and ginger paste  
  
2tbsp of Kashmiri mild chilli powder (if you are not a big fan of spicy food substitute with 2tbsp of paprika)  
  
1tsp of turmeric  
  
1/2tsp ground coriander  
  
1tbsp oil  
  


**Instructions for Chicken Tandoori:**  
  
1.Prepare the chicken by removing the skin and separating the drumstick from the thigh. Next, make three deep cuts on each side of the pieces (This helps marinate to penetrate deeper)  
  
2.Place the chicken in the bowl and rub with 1/2 lemon juice and 1/2tsp of salt.  
  
3.Mix remaining marinade ingredients and rub in the meat.  
  
4.Place in the fridge for 24 hours (2 hours minimum if you in the rush)  
  
5.To cook the chicken, preheat the oven to a 220C fan (428F) setting and place the meat on a flat tray with some baking paper. Once the oven is hot, roast the chicken for 30 minutes on one side, flip to another, and continue on the grill setting for another 10-15 minutes.  
  
6.Rest under foil for 5 minutes before serving.  
  


**Ingredients for Vegetable Biryani:**  
  
300g (10.6oz) of extra long basmati rice  
  
2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil  
  
1 small cinnamon stick  
  
7 cardamom pods  
  
7 cloves  
  
1 star anise  
  
1 medium red onion, sliced  
  
1 large green chilli, seeds removed and sliced  
  
3tsp of garlic and ginger paste  
  
2 small potatoes, small dice  
  
1 medium carrot, sliced  
  
80g (2.8oz) of green beans, sliced  
  
1/2tsp of salt  
  
1tsp garam masala  
  
1/2tsp turmeric  
  
1/2tsp Kashmiri mild chilli powder  
  
1/2tsp ground cumin  
  
5 curry leaves (optional)  
  
3tbsp of natural yoghurt  
  
half lemon juice and zest  
  
550ml (0.6quarts) of vegetable stock

  
  
**Instructions for Biryani:**  
  
1.Soak the washed rice in water for 30-50 minutes.  
  
2.In a large frying pan or a pot, medium heat 2tbsp of ghee and fry aromatics for 2 minutes (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and star anise)  
  
3.Next, add sliced red onion, sliced green chilli and garlic and ginger paste, cook for 5 minutes.  
  
4.Turn up the heat and add 2 diced potatoes, sliced carrot and green beans, season with 1/2tsp of salt and cook until starts to brown (10 minutes)  
  
5.Lower the heat and mix in garam masala, turmeric, mild chilli powder and cumin.  
  
6.Add 5 curry leaves, 3tbsp of natural yoghurt, rice and 550ml of vegetable stock, bring to a boil and reduce to simmer, cover with a lid and continue cooking for around 15 minutes or until rice absorbs all the liquid.  
  
7.Once ready, mix it with a spoon, cover with a lid and rest for another 15 minutes.  
  
8.Your Biryani is ready to be served, drizzle with lemon juice and zest, adjust the saltiness if necessary. Enjoy!  
  


**Ingredients for Cucumber Raita:**  
  
150g (5.3oz) of natural yoghurt  
  
100g (3.5oz) of grated cucumber  
  
half a green chilli, thinly sliced  
  
a handful of coriander  
  
black pepper to garnish  
  


**Instructions for Raita:**  
  
Mix all the ingredients together and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes in the fridge before serving.  
  


**Insight:**  
  
When cooking chicken legs the core temperature should reach 80C (176F) significantly higher than a breast meat 72C (162F)  
  
Remember to rest the meat after cooking, this helps the juices to redistribute in each piece.  
  
Soaking rice helps it to absorb moisture inside each grain. This helps to cook quicker and better.

nan8ux,Prosciutto-wrapped Chicken Roulade with Mushrooms in creamy sauce,3157,73,1620821765.0,0.99,Poultry,Intelligentblond,https://i.redd.it/dsewyouqloy61.jpg,"Ingredients:

2 large Chicken Breasts

2 Yellow Onions

2 Portobello Mushroom Cups or 6oz of any Mushroom

5 Cloves of Garlic

9oz of Fresh Mozzarella cheese

4 slices of Prosciutto ham

1 cup of Heavy Cream

1/2 cup of White Wine (optional)

Fresh Thyme

[full recipe with pictures here](https://tasteabroad.com/recipe/chicken-roulade-with-mushrooms-in-creamy-sauce/)

1. Prepare chicken breast

Paper dry chicken breast and slice horizontally from the thicker side to a thinner, but stop about 1/2 inches to it. This way you will ""butterfly"" your chicken breast, which is a well-known technique to make thin and large chicken pieces. 

Cover your butterflied chicken breast with a piece of plastic wrap and roll a pin over it to make it even and thinner. Set aside.

2.  Make mushroom stuffing 

Mince 5 cloves of garlic and sauté it in a frying pan over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add finely chopped 2 onions, keep sautéing for another 2 minutes. Add chopped Portobello mushroom caps to the pan and keep cooking stirring occasionally for 5 more minutes or until all water will evaporate from the pan. 

Add a quarter of a cup of dry White Wine, mix well and cook until stuffing gets almost dry. 

At that point add 1 teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, and some fresh minced thyme. Mix well and set aside to cool down.

3. Roll!

Place your chicken with a wide side down and thin side up like on the pictures below. 
Divide mushroom sauce into 3 parts: 2 for each chicken breast and 1 for the cream sauce for later. 

Using a spoon, evenly spread 1 part of mushroom stuffing over the chicken piece, leaving half an inch on each side uncovered. 

Next, lay some thinly sliced fresh mozzarella, keep sides uncovered.

Gently roll chicken working your way from the wider bottom to the thinner top. Do not add too much pressure, as your stuffing will try to escape! We will secure everything in place with a cooking twine in just a second.

Now it is time to wrap our roulade in prosciutto. Here is what I learned the hard way ( meaning one of the roulades on final pictures is an unsuccessful test, but still the same delicious ha!): lay prosciutto slices parallel to your chicken roll, this way it is much easier to cover the whole roulade, which will look so much better when the dish is done!

Twine up! Using a cooking twine (the cotton string will work just fine!) gently wrap your roulade, starting from one side of it with tying a knot and work your way to the other side. Now you can add some pressure to help twine keep roulade`s shape while searing it. 

4. Sear roulade 

Preheat your skillet pan on medium heat. I used skillet mostly because I  wanted to be able to cook my dish both on a stovetop and in the oven, so if you have a suitable frying pan you can stick it into your cooking stove, - use that! Also, I used 2 tablespoons of canola oil to season my pan. 

Add your chicken roulades into a hot pan and sear for 3 minutes on each of 4 sides.  Let it cool down for 5 minutes before proceeding to the final step.

5. Sauce and bake

Gently remove twine by cutting each layer and pulling it.

Finally, pour half a cup of heavy cream into your pan, add a third of the mushroom stuffing left from making roulades, and a little bit more cheese ( at this point you can use any cheese you love but make sure it is great melting one). 

Place pan into the preheated to 370F oven and bake for 20 minutes.

*Serves ~6 people*

*I eyeballed the ingredient amounts but will try and write approximations.*

Ingredients:

* ~2.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
* ~20 cloves of garlic finely chopped, ground, or minced
* 5-6 stalks worth of basil leaves (use holy basil or regular basil here)
* 1-2 heads of broccoli
* 1 yellow onion
* 1 red bell pepper

* Oyster sauce (~10 tbsp for marinade and another 4 tbsp for stir fry sauce)
* 2 tbsp Hoisin sauce
* 1 tsp Fish sauce
* 1.5 tbsp Light soy sauce
* 1.5 tbsp Dark/sweet soy sauce
* A few pinches of corn starch
* A few pinches of MSG if you have it although I forgot it this time and still tasted great
* 1 tbsp sugar (also optional - the sauces already add some sweetness)

Procedure:

Slice the chicken into strips and then marinate in plenty of oyster sauce for at least 30 min to an hour but the longer the better.  Fry the chicken strips in peanut oil or another good frying oil on medium heat for ~ 5 minutes on each side or until you see the sauce begin to caramelize on the chicken and it's cooked through.  Set your chicken aside and then, if necessary, add a little more oil to the pan and throw in all of your minced garlic.  Turn up the heat here to high and once the garlic starts to brown slightly, throw in all of your chopped-up veggies.  Fry the veggies until you see them start to brown and then turn down the heat to medium-low and throw in all of your sauces along with the chicken.  Throw in the corn starch, MSG, and sugar, give this a good mix, and cook on medium-low for a minute or two.  Finally, kill the heat or turn down to the lowest setting and add in the basil.  Stir the basil around until it gets all saucy and nice.  It's important not to really cook the basil but to let the very low or residual heat and sauce do their work on it while you mix it in.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/n1ncb8/thai_basil_stir_fry/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/n1ncb8/thai_basil_stir_fry/

lkph8l,"Newish to cooking, first time I've tried to spice up meat in this Chicken Shawarma, it was very nice",41,2,1613429718.0,0.89,Poultry,stanthemanfan,https://i.redd.it/77eafw9t0qh61.jpg,"I got the recipe from this website [https://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/chicken-shawarma/](https://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/chicken-shawarma/)

Only thing I will say is that we didnt have cayenne pepper (now i do) so i used red pepper flakes instead and I kinda did it on a whim so it only marinated for 2 hours I’m sure it’d be a lot better with more than that (and I’ll plan ahead and let it sit overnight the next time I make it)

Oh ya, also I served it with some very basic white rice 

## INGREDIENTS

* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts (2 large breasts)
* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs (4 large thighs)
* 6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil divided
* 2 tsp cumin
* 2 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp allspice
* 3/4 tsp turmeric
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1 pinch cayenne
* Salt and black pepper
* Nonstick cooking oil spray

## Prepare Marinade

1. Slice the chicken breasts into 5-6 pieces each and the thighs into 3-4 pieces each. Place them in a marinating dish or large plastic zipper bag.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup olive oil, the spices, 3/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper (if you are salt sensitive, use 1/2 tsp of salt). Pour the spice marinade over the chicken pieces. Stir with a spoon till all the chicken pieces are evenly coated in the marinade.
3. Cover the marinating dish with plastic wrap, or close the zipper bag. Place chicken in the refrigerator and let it marinate at least 1 hour, up to overnight.

## Oven Cooking Method

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray the baking sheet with nonstick cooking oil. Place the chicken pieces on the sheet, evenly spaced.
2. Place the chicken in the oven. Let it roast for about 15 minutes until cooked through, turning the chicken pieces once with tongs halfway through cooking.
3. Take chicken out of the oven and let it cool slightly. Use a sharp knife to slice the meat into small, thin shawarma-like pieces.
4. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a skillet on the stovetop over medium. Pour half of the chicken into the skillet and saute for 3-4 minutes till the smallest pieces of chicken turn brown and crisp. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste, if desired.
5. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet. Heat another 1 tbsp of oil and saute the remaining chicken in the same way. Serve warm.

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 30 minutes

Inactive time: 45 minutes

Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

Servings: 4

Calories: 673kcal

## Equipment

* Medium pot with lid
* Baking sheet
* Ovenproof skillet
* Colander

## Ingredients

## Peruvian Chicken:

* 2 pounds boneless, skin-on chicken thighs or boneless, skinless
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 mandarin juiced (or use 1 lime)
* 1 tablespoon Aji rocoto optional
* 1 tablespoon wild mountain cumin or use ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* ½ teaspoon freshly ground white pepper optional
* ½ teaspoon Mexican oregano
* 2 teaspoons neutral oil for frying

## Butter-Basted Potatoes

* 2 russet or Yukon gold potatoes peeled and cut into thick round cylinders, about 2 inches thick
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Salt to taste

## Avocado Salad:

* 1 avocado
* 1 Roma tomato diced
* 1 jalapeño trimmed and minced
* ¼ cup fresh cilantro leaves minced
* 1 lime juiced
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Rice:

* 1 cup uncooked white rice
* 2 cups water
* 1 tablespoon butter optional
* Salt to taste

## For Serving:

* Aji verde
* Minced cilantro

## Instructions

## Marinate the Chicken:

* In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients for the marinade and stir until well-combined. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator for 30 minutes as you prepare the rest of the recipe.

## Parboil the Potatoes:

* Preheat oven to 425ºF. Cover the peeled and cut potatoes with water in the medium pot. Add salt and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are almost cooked through, about 8-9 minutes. Drain and transfer to a baking sheet to dry. Sprinkle with salt.

## Prepare the Avocado Salad:

* While the potatoes parboil, prepare the avocado salad. Peel and remove the seed from the avocado. Dice the avocado and transfer to a bowl with the lime juice, minced jalapeño, cilantro, and salt and pepper. Do not add the tomato until ready to serve.

## Cook the Rice:

* Rinse out the pot used to cook the potatoes. Combine the white rice with water, butter, and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest for 5-10 minutes.

## Roast the Potatoes:

* Melt the butter in a small bowl and use a brush to brush the tops and sides of the potatoes on the baking sheet. Transfer to the oven for 25-30 minutes or until they are fork-tender and golden brown. Once the potatoes start to turn golden brown, turn on the broiler for 3-5 minutes until the tops are crispy and well-browned. Remove from the oven and keep warm.

## Cook the Chicken:

* While the potatoes are roasting, prepare the chicken. Heat the neutral oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the chicken in an even layer–cooking in batches if needed–skin-side down. Cook without moving for 5 minutes until the skin is very crispy and well-browned. Transfer to a plate and brown the remaining chicken.
* Nestle all the chicken thighs, skin-side up, in the skillet. It's okay if the skillet is a bit crowded since you've already browned the skin. Transfer to the oven with the potatoes and roast for 15 minutes until completely an instant-read thermometer reaches 165ºF.
* You may broil the tops with the potatoes, as well, if you'd like to further crisp up the skin. Remove the chicken from the oven and transfer it to the stove top. Turn off the heat.

## To Serve:

* Right before serving, stir the tomatoes into the avocado salad. Season once more with salt to taste. Slice up the chicken thighs. Divide the cooked rice between shallow bowls and pile the chicken on top. Spoon the avocado salad on the other side of the bowl and arrange one or two butter-roasted potatoes on each plate. Garnish with more minced cilantro, if you like and a spoonful of aji verde.

l630lj,Chicken Gyros Kebab with crunchy gherkin salad &amp; oregano garlic sauce,3100,75,1611748758.0,0.99,Poultry,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/a0alp17y6vd61.jpg,"A long time ago in Krakow, there used to be that place where you could buy Gyros Kebab served in the puffed pitta bread. It is one of those that you start shovelling with your fork and halfway through you grab it with your hands.

Delicious grilled chicken in the very characteristic Greek spice blend, crunchy salad with gherkins, loads of garlic sauce. I tried to recreate that dish and without a shadow of a doubt, I succeeded.

The spice blend you can prepare in advance and store it in the jar. These ingredients should give you enough to make this recipe twice.

**Ingredients for Gyros spice blend:**

* 1tsp mild chilli powder
* 1tsp ground coriander
* 1/2tsp turmeric
* 3tsp oregano
* 1tsp marjoram
* 3tsp paprika
* 1tsp garlic powder
* 1tsp onion powder
* 0,5tsp ground fenugreek
* 1tsp ground mustard seeds
* 1tsp sugar
* 2tsp salt

This recipe makes 4 big portions

**Ingredients for the chicken:**

* 3 big chicken breasts sliced
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* half of the gyros spice blend
* 2 skewers

**Ingredients for the salad and sauce:**

* 1 medium onion sliced
* 2 medium tomatoes diced (sweeter than better)
* half of the small Chinese leaf thinly sliced
* 200g (7oz) of sweet gherkins diced
* 150g (5.3oz) sweetcorn
* 150g (5.3oz) thick yoghurt
* 2tsp mayo
* 1/2tsp oregano
* 1/2tsp black pepper
* 3 garlic cloves minced

**Ingredients for Pitta bread:**

* 350g (12.3oz) strong flour (contains more gluten, this helps to hold shape upon inflation)
* 1tsp baking powder
* 1tsp sugar
* 1tsp salt
* 100ml (0.1quart) milk (you can use water instead)
* 130g (4.6oz) yoghurt
* 50g (1.9oz) melted butter

**Instructions for chicken and salad:**

**1.** Mix the **chicken** with the **olive oil** and **spice blend**, skewer and leave it for minimum **30 minutes** or marinate **overnight**.

**2.** For the sauce mix **yoghurt** with minced **garlic**, **mayonnaise**, **oregano** and **black pepper**.

**3.** Grill the chicken skewers in the oven  250C (482F) for around **10 minutes** then turn upside down and grill for another **10 minutes** (place skewers in a baking dish). When ready take of the skewer and cover with tin foil to keep warm (thighs may need a little longer).

**4.** To serve **cut pitta in half** and stuff with **salad**, **chicken** and **sauce** (pour some of the chicken juice inside for extra flavour).

**Instructions for pitta:**

**1.** For the pitta bread mix all the **dry ingredients** together then **add all the wet**. Mix then knead for around **5 minutes**, until a smooth dough ball is formed. Rest for **30 minutes** covered with bowl or clingfilm.

**2.** Heat the oven to **250C (482F)** for at least **15 minutes** (for the pitta bread you will need to heat bakers stone, cast iron pan or a tray).

**3.** Divide the pitta dough into **four** and roll each one to a **20cm circle** about **2mm thick** (8-inch circle, about 0.08inch thick).

**4.** Place the dough on to the heated baking stone or cast iron pan. Applying heat from the bottom and the top will create puffed pitta, watch it closely not to burn it, this takes around **3,5 minutes**. (Do one at the time, and you may need to heat up your baking surface again before doing another one).

📷📷

**Insight:**

* I also like gyros chicken just with gherkin salad.

We'll be covering:

* How to poach a perfect, juicy **White Cut Chicken**
* How to make my dad’s addictive **Ginger Scallion sauce**
* The traditional Chinese way to **carve and plate a chicken** from head to toe
* The various Chinese idioms / meanings tied to whole chicken

Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/PIX8it0BIao) if you want to follow a visual :)

# Superstition: Chicken

In Chinese tradition, chicken is intertwined with many sayings and superstitions of good fortune, wealth, and resilience.

Even though my parents didn't have much meat growing up in China, this is one of the dishes my parents always ate on Lunar New Year's eve and other festivities.

Especially with auspicious foods, Chinese superstition involves a lot of creative word-play. The word for chicken, gāi in Cantonese and jī in Mandarin, sounds like several words of good fortune.

Just to name a few phrases that my parents shared with us:

* hóu sai gaai 好世界 - A Cantonese phrase that roughly translates to good world, good life.
* dàjídàlì 大吉大利 - A Mandarin phrase that roughly translates to great luck, great profit.
* yáuh tàuh yáuh méih 有头有尾 - A Cantonese phrase that literally translates to: ""has a head, has a tail."" It means ""good beginning, good ending."" This is one of the reasons why it's important to make a whole chicken for Lunar New Year.
* jáau pàh jáau wàh 抓扒抓鏵 - A Toisanese phrase, related to eating the chicken legs, that roughly means ""face all challenges with persistence.""

So, basically, eat a whole chicken if you want to live. (jk)

## The Recipe

Main Ingredients

* 4 lb **whole chicken** (traditionally for Lunar New Year, the chicken has its head &amp; feet intact)
* 2 oz **green onion**
* 1.5 oz **ginger**
* 5 tbsp **corn oil**

Additional Flavor &amp; Seasoning

* 1 tsp **salt** (for boiling water)
* 2 tsp **salt** (for ginger scallion sauce)
* 1 tbsp **sesame oil**

# Step 1 - Boil water, add salt

Set the stove to high heat and start boiling a generous amount of water in the pot you'll be using.

We'll want to be able to fully submerge our chicken in the water to make sure it cooks evenly.

We'll also be adding **1 teaspoon of salt**. My dad says not to add too much here.

# Step 2 - Prepare &amp; cook chicken

* Wait for the water to come to a boil.

We'll be doing a couple of things in this step, mostly to ensure that the entire chicken is cooked evenly for maximum tenderness.

* **Pierce a hole in the skin in the neck -** This helps the water flow through the chicken cavity to help it cook more evenly.
* **Stretch the legs away from the body several times -** This helps to avoid having a big clump of chicken meat that's undercooked.
* **Slowly dip the chicken 3 times in the boiling water -** This helps even out the temperatures on the inside of the cavity and on the exterior of the chicken. Make sure the water is already boiling before you do this.
* **Add the chicken and make sure it's completely submerged -** If you have to add more boiling water, do it.

From here, we'll cover the pot.

Here's a rough heat / timing overview:

* Once the pot's been covered, leave it on high heat for 5 minutes as the water comes to a boil again.
* Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for another 35-40 minutes. The larger the chicken, the longer you cook it. The sweet spot is 4 pounds.
* Check if it's done. If so, transfer it to an ice bath. (More on both of these later.)

# Step 3 - Mince scallions and ginger

While we wait for the chicken to cook, we'll start on our sauce by mincing our **green onions** (2 oz) and **ginger** (1.5 oz)​.

My dad said the exact ratio and amounts don't matter too much. Most recipes I've seen use more scallions than ginger.

Having a surplus of sauce is a great problem to have, since you can use it on pretty much everything. (I LOVE dousing my rice and vegetables in this addictive sauce)

For the green onions, we'll be using the white stems (about 4 stems at the default serving size). Cut each stem in half, length-wise, and then into strips. Then, mince the strips into fine pieces.

For the ginger, we'll be cutting them into thin slices, strips, and then fine pieces.

My dad is using separate plates to hold the green onions and ginger. The ginger will be cooked first in the next step, so this makes it easier to separate.

Also, feel free to use a food processor here instead of mincing.

# Step 4 - Heat oil, cook ginger scallions

We'll heat up our wok on high heat and add **corn oil** (5 tbsp).

The oil should be around 350-400F before we add the ginger.

A good visual cue is to wait until the oil starts ""shimmering"", or forming ripples across the surface due to the heat.

Why do we do this? By cooking everything in oil, we unlock the aromatics of the ginger and green onion.

Once the oil is hot enough, add the ginger and cook for about 15 seconds before adding the green onions. Cook everything for another 20-30 seconds before transferring the sauce to a bowl.

# Step 5 - Flavor the sauce

We'll add **salt** (2 tsp) and **sesame oil** (1 tbsp) to the bowl, and mix for 30-60 seconds.

Do a taste test and adjust if necessary. My dad emphasized multiple times how important it is to add sesame oil here, so make sure you don't skip it.

# Step 6 - Prepare an ice bath

Grab a big bowl and dump a few handfuls of ice into it. Fill it roughly halfway with cold water.

The ice bath is very important - once the chicken is done cooking, we need to immediately cool it down.

Why is this so important?

* **It helps the meat contract and locks the juices inside - I**f we skip this step, juices will flood out as we chop the chicken into pieces.
* **It helps the skin stay attached -** Without this step, we'll have a bunch of loose pieces of skin everywhere.
* **It gives the skin a bit more of a chewy texture**

# Step 7 - Determine if the chicken is done

Once the time draws near, we can uncover the pot. Poke the thickest part of the chicken (around the thigh) deeply with a chopstick.

If blood or red fluid leaks out, we need to cook it for a few more minutes.

If the fluid is clear, it's ready for the ice bath.

Feel free to use your newfound chicken broth however you'd like. In the video, my dad created two additional dishes (a soup and a veggie) out of it by boiling bok choy with some ginger.

# Step 8 - Lift and transfer to ice bath

Carefully take two chopsticks under the chicken wings, and lift it over the pot.

Suspend it over the pot for 30-45 seconds to let some of the residual water drip out.

Then, carefully transfer it into the ice bath. Prepare for a splash!

Let the chicken sit in the bath for 5 minutes, occasionally pouring water over the surface of the chicken and rotating the chicken in the container.

# Step 9 - Carve the chicken

* This could honestly be its own post, but for now it will live in a very detailed step in this recipe.

This is a lot easier to follow in our YouTube video, where we dedicate about 6 minutes of time to this segment.

There are a few things to keep in mind before you start.

* My dad’s done this hundreds of times, and it took him about 10 minutes from start to finish. It’ll probably take a lot longer if you’re a beginner like me, but the main thing is just to make sure your cleaver is sharp and that you’re moving carefully and deliberately. 
* If you don’t already have a cleaver, it’s still technically possible, but I highly recommend getting one if you plan on making this dish. Here are some options:
   * Dexter Russell Heavy Duty Cleaver 
   * Saamhangnga Cleaver 
* For easier, safer cutting, you should use a larger, thicker cutting board that’s preferably made of wood, and you should place a moist towel underneath it to increase its stability.

How to plate, according to Chinese tradition:

* Basically everything is plated - even parts that aren't readily edible like the head.
* Each piece of chicken is laid out on a large plate according to where it was on its body, head to toe, right to left.
* You'll often see this served on a large oval-shaped plate.

Order of operations:

* Cut off the neck and feet, cut into small pieces
* Cut and place the head and butt at opposite ends of the middle axis of the plate
* Remove the wings and thighs
* Cut and split the torso into two halves (front and back)
* Split the back in half, and cut it into pieces
* Cut and pry away the breast bone, and cut it into pieces
* Cut the thighs and wings into small pieces

Cutting techniques:

* A technique my dad uses a lot involves making a shallow slice to wedge the cleaver, and then hitting down on the blade with our palm to drive the blade through the bone. 
* In our recent knife skills interview, my dad talked about the 3 different parts of the blade - the root, the belly, and the tip. When chopping through bone, he always makes contact with the root, or the part of the blade closest to the handle. 

When I first started this project, documenting how my dad carves a chicken was high on the list of traditions I wanted to learn and share. It always feels like I’m watching an artist at work when I see my dad gracefully chop and plate everything. 

Every cut has an intention, and every piece has a place. Almost everything goes on the plate, and nothing is wasted. Especially for Lunar New Year and other celebrations, bak chit gai is meant to be one of the main decorative centerpieces on the dinner table, and carving it up into beautiful bite-sized pieces is an honor that I hope to take on one day for my own family. 

-----

# Our why

I've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.

You also might be able to find a variation of jarred hot peppers and tomatoes at your grocery store that would be an okay substitute too!

There's really not much to this recipe, honestly, it's just one of my favorite quick weeknight meals that can be modified endlessly. Try it with pork chops or hot Italian sausage links. you can also do skinless chicken thighs or even chicken breasts, if you want to reduce calories.

Serve it over rice, buttered noodles or potatoes, mashed cauliflower, or with sautéed veggies.

k3lfzg,Seared Duck Breast with Lingonberry Sauce,62,8,1606697960.0,0.94,Poultry,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/4gzwgafe0a261.jpg,"This perfectly seared duck breast with lingonberry sauce is a simple and beautiful meal.

### Equipment

* Skillet
* Sauce pan
* Large pot
* Colander
* Hand mixer

### Ingredients

#### Ricotta Mashed Potatoes:

* 1½ pounds Yukon gold potatoes peeled and quartered
* ½ cup ricotta cheese
* ½ cup whole milk plus more, as necessary
* 2 tablespoons butter
* ½ teaspoon nutmeg plus more as desired
* ½ teaspoon white pepper
* Salt to taste

#### Duck Breasts:

* 2 Moulard magret duck breasts skin scored and breasts seasoned all over with salt and pepper
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Lingonberry Sauce:

* 2 teaspoons reserved duck fat
* 3 tablespoons butter divided
* 1 shallot peeled and minced
* ½ cup lingonberry jam
* 1 lemon juiced
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* ¼ cup water

#### For Serving:

* 1 shallot peeled and thinly sliced into rounds
* 4 ounces arugula
* Salt and pepper

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Potatoes:

* Cover the diced Yukon gold potatoes with water and add salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 25 minutes until very soft. Drain into a colander and transfer to a large bowl.
* Add the ricotta, milk, butter, nutmeg, and white pepper to the bowl and use a hand mixer or potato masher to blend until smooth and creamy. If desired, add a few splashes more of milk until desired consistency is reached. Taste and season with salt. Add more nutmeg or white pepper to taste, as desired. Keep the potatoes warm as you prepare the rest of the meal.

#### Start the Duck:

* Place the duck breasts, skin-side down, in a skillet (ensuring that there is enough room for both of them without them touching each other). Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for 10-15 minutes until the skin is very deep, golden brown and the fat has rendered out. As you cook the duck skin, use a spoon to remove some of the duck fat and transfer to a heat-proof bowl.
* Flip the duck breasts and cook an additional 7-10 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 140ºF when inserted at the thickest part of the duck breast. Transfer to a wooden cutting board and cover with foil. Rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

#### Prepare the Lingonberry Sauce:

* While the duck is cooking, prepare the lingonberry sauce. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and two teaspoons of the reserved duck fat in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 2-3 minutes until softened.
* Add the lingonberry jam, lemon juice, ¼ water, and sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes until thickened. Once thickened and reduced, turn off the heat. Mount the butter into the sauce and stir until emulsified and glossy. Set aside.

#### Cook the Arugula:

* Immediately after the lingonberry sauce is cooked, prepare the arugula. Remove all but a tablespoon or two of duck fat from the skillet and transfer to the heatproof bowl.
* Turn the skillet to medium heat and add the sliced shallot. Cook for 2 minutes until softened.
* Add the arugula and cook for 3-4 minutes until mostly wilted. Turn off the heat and allow the residual heat to cook the arugula the rest of the way. Season with salt and pepper.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the mashed potatoes between shallow bowls. Pile the arugula on top and arrange the sliced duck breast on top. Spoon the lingonberry sauce on top. If you like, sprinkle a touch of nutmeg on top of the mashed potatoes and garnish with just a hint of flaky sea salt on top of the lingonberry sauce. Enjoy!

Oftentimes when people think of Vietnamese food, they immediately think of pho or banh mi. Welp, Vietnamese people eat FAR more than just pho or banh mi, and at home, food is oftentimes far simpler and humbler, like this simple preparation of Vietnamese garlicky roast chicken. 

  
Roast chicken has thousands of iterations across cultures, but this is one of my absolute favorites, and it’s sooo simple: it’s got just six ingredients plus the chicken, and after 30 minutes roasting in the oven, you’ve got a lip-smackingly luscious bird that will beg to have its juices sopped up with some rice!

  
To watch my video on how to make this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90)  
**Viet Garlicky Roast Chicken Recipe (adapted from Andrea Nguyen)** 

  
1 whole 3.5-4 lb chicken, preferably organic and air-chilled, spatchcocked (back bone removed with bird splayed flat), OR 3.5-4 lb chicken parts (thighs, drumsticks, and wings) 

  
*Marinade ingredients:*

* 4 whole garlic cloves, minced finely 
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1.5 tsp sugar
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* 1.5 Tbsp neutral oil
* 3.5 Tbsp Maggi seasoning 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Combine all sauce ingredients into a bowl and mix well. 
2. Prepare the chicken: take the chicken (or chicken parts), and using a chopstick or skewer, carefully separate the skin from the meat all over. Then, add the marinade sauce all over the chicken with your hands, making sure to get the sauce between the meat and the skin. 
3. Refrigerate the chicken and allow to marinade for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor penetration. 
4. The next day, preheat oven to 500 F. Place spatchcocked chicken on a cast iron roasting pan or roasting tray. Place chicken in the oven and roast for about 30 minutes, checking about 5-10 min in to ensure the chicken isn’t browning too quickly. If it is, tent the darker parts with foil and lower heat to 450 F. If using parts, roast time may be closer to 40-45 min. 
5. After about 30 minutes, remove chicken from the oven. Check doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer - thighs should register about 165 F when done. 
6. Once the chicken is done, allow to rest for 15 min to ensure optimal juiciness level. Then, cut and serve with rice and enjoy. ",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/k3by3g/simple_vietnamese_garlicky_roast_chicken/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/k3by3g/simple_vietnamese_garlicky_roast_chicken/

* Medium pot
* Fine mesh sieve

### Ingredients

#### Chicken Stock:

* 2½ pound whole chicken cut up
* 6 cups water
* 1 yellow onion peeled and quartered
* 1 head garlic halved cross-wise
* 1” piece of ginger cut into thirds
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce

### Instructions

#### Cook the Chicken Stock:

* Cover the chicken with 6 cups water (more, if needed to fully cover the chicken) in a large pot. Add the onion, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, and soy sauce. Season liberally with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for at least 1 hour or until the chicken is falling off the bone and the broth has deepened in color and has reduced to no more than 3 cups.

#### Strain the Stock:

* Transfer the chicken and garlic to a bowl. Strain the stock into a large bowl through a fine mesh sieve and discard the remaining solids. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.

#### Finish the Stock:

* Add the chopped bok choy to the broth and cook for 5-7 minutes until bright green. Turn off the heat and whisk in the miso paste until completely incorporated.

#### Cook the Ramen:

* While the broth finishes cooking, boil the ramen according to package instructions. Drain and divide the ramen between 4 bowls.

I just started a recipe &amp; reviews site, so any traffic is much appreciated!

Stuffed squash is a great healthy and simple way to kick off the fall cooking season! It's also a great way to use up leftovers. I happened to use some leftover chicken for the filling, but if you don’t have that, any ground or shredded turkey or chicken can work as a substitute. The quinoa &amp; garlic was also leftover from the prior day, but that can be cooked as needed as well.

**Ingredients:**

* 2 acorn squash
* 1 cup of shredded chicken (or cooked ground chicken)
* ½ cup cooked quinoa
* 2 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro
* ⅓ squeezed lemon juice
* ½ cup chopped walnuts
* 2 cloves of roasted garlic
* ½ cup blueberries
* 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* ⅓ cup chopped feta cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
2. Cut the squash in half, lengthwise, and oil both sides. Remove seeds from squash. Place it face down on a lined baking sheet and bake at 450 for 30 minutes.
3. In a bowl, mix all ingredients together except the feta cheese. Save a small amount of the cilantro for topping.
4. When squash is finished, scoop out a small cavity to make the hole larger, and combine scooped squash with the other ingredients.
5. Fill the squash halves and top with feta cheese.
6. Bake for 10 minutes at 450.
7. When you remove them from the oven, top with the remaining cilantro.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/j3lnpp/stuffed_acorn_squash/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/j3lnpp/stuffed_acorn_squash/

Now cannabis is legal in a lot of places, here's a cannabis-chicken breast recipe (better with skin, but will work without):

**Ingredients:**

Butter, about 30g

Twig of fresh thyme

Seasoning (salt, pepper)

Cannabis resin

**Method:**

Place in breast in open foil, skin-side up (or, for skinless, where the skin would have been) forming a boat shape with the foil for the breast to sit in, resting in juices.

Place other ingredients under/around breast; season the exposed top.

Place under a broiler on a medium heat until done - the butter and juices should keep the breast moist.  About 20 minutes.  Check using a thermometer or other method you're happy with.

Juicy, light, fragrant whole breast.  Have some bread or rice to mop up the cooking juices when serving.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/gsdrll/chicken_recommendations/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/gsdrll/chicken_recommendations/

It is lengthy but works every time. The secret is to cook to temperature:

Pat each boneless chicken breast dry with paper towels and sprinkle each breast with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Place the breasts, skin side up, on a wire rack placed in a roasting pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours.

Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels and sprinkle each breast with 1/4 teaspoon pepper.

Pour the oil in a heavy 12-inch skillet (preferably cast-iron) and tilt to coat the surface with oil. Place the chicken, skin side down, in the cold skillet and place the skillet over medium heat. Place a heavy skillet or Dutch oven on top of the chicken to weight it and keep it flat. Cook until the skin begins to turn golden brown and the meat begins to turn opaque along the edges, 5 to 9 minutes.

Remove the weight and continue to cook the chicken over medium heat until the skin is well browned and very crisp, 6 to 8 minutes.

Flip the chicken, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook until the second side is lightly browned and the chicken registers 160°, 2 to 5 minutes.

**Bonus**: If you don't want the chicken skin after the chicken is cooked remove the skin. Season the skin with salt, pepper, lemon pepper and thyme. Place the skin on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Top with another sheet of parchment and another baking sheet (to keep skin from curling). Bake at 350 degrees until browned and crisp, about 1 hour.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/gk2u2x/does_anyone_have_a_roast_chicken_recipe_suitable/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/gk2u2x/does_anyone_have_a_roast_chicken_recipe_suitable/

This time I finally got it down and am so excited to share the recipe! The secret to cover the chicken in egg before dredging in corn starch, and then twice-frying the chicken.

## INGREDIENTS

* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thigh (can use wings or breast if preferred)
* 1 egg (beaten)
* Salt (just a pinch for seasoning chicken)
* 3 cloves garlic (minced; 2 cloves for sauce) 
* 1 cup corn starch (or potato starch)
* Cooking oil (something with a high smoke point, I used vegetable oil)

**Sauce**

* ¼ cup honey
* 1 tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste; 1 tbsp for mild, 1.5 tbsp for medium, 2 tbsp for spicy)
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)
* ½ tbsp sesame oil
* 1 tbsp brown sugar

## DIRECTIONS

* Prepare the chicken thigh by trimming the fat off. Slice the chicken into bite size pieces
* Mix the beaten egg, salt, and 1 clove of minced garlic with the chicken in a bowl
* Pour the corn starch into another large bowl. Dredge each piece of chicken in the corn starch so that it is completely covered
* In a deep pan or wok, add enough cooking oil so that the chicken pieces will be fully submerged and heat over high heat. You’ll know the oil is hot enough if when you put a piece of chicken in, the oil starts boiling around it
* Add half of the chicken to the oil. We only do half so that we don’t overcrowd the pan and lower the temperature too much. Flip the chicken periodically to ensure all sides are evenly cooked. When the chicken is a light golden brown (5-10 minutes), remove from oil and cook the second batch the same way
* After the chicken is done frying, place on a plate lined with a paper towel to soak up the oil. We’ll let the chicken cool before we flash fry it the second time📷
* In the meantime, we’ll prepare the sauce. In a skillet, combine the sauce ingredients (don’t forget the extra 2 cloves of garlic) and mix well
* Heat up the sauce over medium heat until it starts to boil, then reduce to medium-low. Simmer for 5 minutes while stirring until the sauce thickens a bit, then reduce to lowest heat
* When the sauce is almost done, reheat your oil over high heat. When the oil is hot enough, flash fry the chicken for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Your chicken should be a nice golden brown at this point. Remove from heat again and place on a plate lined with a paper towel
* Now, mix the chicken into the sauce in the skillet and cook over low heat until the chicken is fully covered by the sauce. Remove from heat and serve immediately

I made it tonight and really enjoyed the end result. As with any marinade, the longer you let it sit, the better it is. I let it marinate for about 8 hours. 

There are likely better and simpler tzatziki recipes that don’t require fresh herbs that I will try in the future, but this was good. 

**Ingredients**

* 2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs

* Long wooden skewers

**The Yogurt Marinade**

* 2 cups greek yogurt

* ¼ cup lemon juice

* ¾ cup olive oil

* 1 tablespoon kosher salt

* 2 cups greek yogurt

* 1 tablespoon garlic, minced

* Diced red onion
* Diced cucumber 
* Diced tomato 
* Feta cheese (optional, but I think it makes it)

* In a large bowl, combine marinade ingredients and stir well.

* On a cutting board, cut the chicken thighs into strips/cubes. You will be putting them on a skewer later, so keep that in mind when cutting

* In another large bowl or gallon plastic bag, combine chicken thighs and marinade, stirring well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour and up to one day

* Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).

* Shred the cucumber, be sure to squeeze out any excess liquid.

* In a medium bowl, combine tzatziki ingredients and stir well. Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
* Suspend your skewers over a baking dish like I did in the picture. 

* Bake for 40 minutes or, until internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). Let cool for 10 minutes. (The original recipe had a 2 HOUR cook time, mine took 40 minutes)

This is a modified version of the cacciatore my grandmother and father made while I was growing up. I made it from memory a few times and it turned out really well. You can make your own sauce or use jarred sauce, it turns out well either way. 

**Ingredients**

* 3-4 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs

* 1 pound hot Italian sausage 

* 2 green bell peppers

* 2 red bell peppers 

* 1 large white onion (or two small) 

* 1 head/bulb of garlic

* 1 package mushrooms 

* 48 oz homemade sauce **or** TWO 24oz jars Classico Spicy Tomato Basil sauce **or** 48 oz of your favorite sauce

* Fresh basil

* Olive oil

* Italian Seasoning

* Chicken broth (to taste) 

**Instructions**

* Get out your crockpot or large stew pot because it’s all going to cook together there. Also get out a large frying pan. I cook many of the ingredients separately, but only use one pan. 

* Crush each clove of garlic in your head of garlic. It will be used throughout the recipe and it’s easier that way. 

* Brown your chicken thighs with salt, pepper, 2-3 garlic cloves and half white onion. Set aside in crock pot or stew pot.  They will finish cooking in your sauce. 

* Remove skin from hot Italian sausage if necessary, then brown sausage. I like to break it up very small like you are making taco meat. Set aside in crock pot or stew pot. 

* Sauté your 2 red and 2 green bell peppers and onion in garlic and olive oil. Set aside in crock pot or stew pot. 

* Sauté 1 pack mushroom caps sautéed in olive oil, garlic and Italian seasoning to taste. Set aside in crock pot or stew pot. 

* Add jars of sauce to crockpot and several springs of fresh basil, liberal use of Italian seasoning and salt to taste.

* If your sauce seems to thick add a little Chicken broth to taste. I always add a little anyway because it helps the chicken and tomato flavors come together even more. If it ends up too thin, you can always take out some liquid and/or cook it longer and reduce. 

* Cook in the crockpot on low for 3-4 hours. The longer the better and the more the chicken thighs will break down.

* Serve with white rice or pasta, though we ALWAYS had it with rice so it soaks up all that good sauce.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/gag8eh/my_own_chicken_cacciatore_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/gag8eh/my_own_chicken_cacciatore_recipe/

For the chicken marinade:

* 28 oz (800g) boneless and skinless chicken thighs cut into bite-sized pieces

* 1 cup plain yogurt

* 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic

* 1 tablespoon ginger

* 2 teaspoons garam masala

* 1 teaspoon turmeric

* 1 teaspoon ground cumin

* 1 teaspoon Kashmiri chili (or 1/2 teaspoon ground red chili powder)

* 1 teaspoon of salt

For the sauce:

* 2 tablespoons of vegetable/canola oil

* 2 tablespoons butter

* 2 small onions (or 1 large onion) finely diced

* 1 1/2 tablespoons garlic finely grated

* 1 tablespoon ginger finely grated

* 1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala

* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin

* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder

* 1 teaspoon ground coriander

* 14 oz (400g) tomato puree (tomato sauce/Passata)

* 1 teaspoon Kashmiri chili (optional for colour and flavour) if you can’t find it Kashmiri chili, you can use 2 parts paprika and 1 part cayenne

* 1 teaspoon ground red chili powder (adjust to your taste preference)

* 1 teaspoon salt

* 1 1/4 cups of heavy or thickened cream (use evaporated milk for lower calories)

* 1 teaspoon brown sugar

* 1/4 cup water if needed

* 4 tablespoons Fresh cilantro or coriander to garnish


**INSTRUCTIONS**

* In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 10 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows, that’s what I did).

* Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm - I just put a glass dish in the oven at 200 degrees. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)

* Melt the butter in the same pan. Fry the onions until soft (about 3 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. 

* Add garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant, then add garam masala, cumin, turmeric and coriander. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.

* Pour in the tomato puree, chili powders and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.

* Stir the cream and sugar through the sauce. Add the chicken and its juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in the water to thin out the sauce, if needed.

* Garnish with cilantro (coriander) and serve with fresh, hot basmati rice.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/g8f1qe/chicken_tikka_masala/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/g8f1qe/chicken_tikka_masala/

2 medium chicken thighs

1 egg

1/2  cup (75g) flour 

1 1/2 (7.5g) tsp pepper

2 pinches of salt

1 tsp (5g) parsley (dried or fresh)

1-2 cloves garlic, finely minced

1/2 (2ml) tsp hotsauce 

1/2 tsp (2.5g) seasoning salt (chicken, cajun or otherwise)

1/4 tsp  (1.25g) chilli flakes

oil of your choice for frying (I used vegetable oil; amount depends on the size pan used but the oil should come halfway up the chicken when it is placed into the pan)

Method

1. Season the chicken. Add the garlic and parsley to the chicken and make sure to massage and stuff the seasoning under the skin of the chicken thighs and any crevices. Set aside 
2. Prepare the wet mixture. Mix the egg and hot sauce together in a bowl and set aside.
3. Prepare the dry mixture. On a plate, mix together the flour, chilli flakes and pepper. (for crispy bits sprinkle a little a water into the flour to create flaky bits on the chicken) 
4. Use two separate hands or tongs to first dip the thigh into the egg to fully coat it then into the flour and fully coat it. 
5. Heat the oil to 350F (175 C). Place chicken in the oil and fry for 8 - 9 minutes on each side. 
6. Take the chicken out and place on a draining rack or a paper towel. 
7. Enjoy.

I cook this at least twice a week. Very flexible recipe because you can use different veggies (I use broccoli, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, carrots, peppers, sometimes potatoes, sometimes corn, sometimes water chestnuts) and different seasonings (e.g., dill with lemon juice after pulling them out of the oven, garam marsala, old bay, anything to mix it up) while being able to limit the salt and any veggies that your mom may need to avoid (my dad has to avoid potatoes; they send his blood sugar through the roof!). It also is great over rice or quinoa.

This is a single-pan recipe, which works great for me, but I'm only cooking for two.

fu8i68,Chicken noodle soup with crispy chicken skin (pressure cooker),124,5,1585920819.0,0.92,Poultry,wetforest,https://i.imgur.com/3VsKZrN.jpg,"# Ingredients

* 3 skin-on chicken leg quarters 1.5–2 lb; or enough chicken thighs to make up the same weight
* 1 yellow onion, diced
* 2 large carrots, diced 1 cup or 150 g; can add up to one extra cup if desired
* 4 celery stalks, sliced 2 cups or 300 g
* 1 tsp fine salt or 2 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 2 bay leaves
* 1/2 tsp dried thyme optional
* 1/2 tsp dried rosemary optional
* 7–8 cups chicken stock water works as well because the chicken flavour will be quite strong regardless
* 3 cups egg noodles 120 g; add up to 1 extra cup (40 g)

# Instructions

1. Remove skin from chicken and set aside in a single layer on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. (The skins will release a lot of grease, so it's important for the baking sheet to have a rim to catch the drippings.)
1. Remove all the visible fat from the chicken. Don't sleep on this step unless you want your soup to be very greasy!
1. Add chicken to the bottom of the Instant Pot inner pot, followed by all the other ingredients in the order listed, except the egg noodles.
1. Set the Instant Pot to HIGH PRESSURE for 10 minutes.

# Now for the noodles, you have three cooking options:

1. Add them into the pot along with all the other ingredients in step 3, and pressure cook them together. This will result in soft, mushy, fall-apart noodles. (This is actually the texture I prefer… further down the post I'll explain why.) If you choose this option, allow the Instant Pot to naturally release for 10 minutes after it turns off, before quick releasing the rest of the pressure.
1. After the 10 minutes of pressure cooking, quick release the pressure immediately. Take the lid off and switch the Instant Pot to SAUTE mode on HIGH. Add the egg noodles and cook for 8–10 minutes or as directed on your pasta package. This will result in al dente noodles that gradually soften as they sit in the broth.
1. Cook the noodles separately as the Instant Pot is doing its thing. Drain and rinse with cold water, then toss with a little oil to keep the pieces from sticking together. Keep the pasta in its own container, and add portions as desired. This option keeps the noodles at the perfect texture throughout the week (if you have leftovers), and allows you to add as little or as much pasta to each bowl of soup as desired.

# Meanwhile, roast the crispy chicken skin:

1. Bake or roast the chicken skin you set aside earlier at 350 °F, for 30–45 minutes, or until they look crispy and a deep golden brown (but not too dark).
1. After taking them out of the oven, immediately transfer to a plate lined with paper towel to absorb the extra grease.
1. While the roasted chicken skin is cooling, remove the cooked chicken pieces from the Instant Pot and shred using two forks. Add back to the pot.
1. Break the crispy chicken skin into pieces, and add to each bowl.
1. Ladle chicken noodle soup into bowls and enjoy! (Remember to remove the bay leaves as you eat!)

* 6 chicken thighs
* 1 onion

## DIRECTIONS

1. If you like, cut the thigh in 3 or 4 pieces, or you can leave as one big piece.
2. Quarter the onion and crush the garlic.
3. Mix all the ingredients and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes or maximum overnight.
4. Skewer the chicken and the onion by alternating them. Keep some space between the pieces of meat (better undercrowded that overcrowded)
5. Prepare some hot charcoal if you barbecuing, or preheat your oven at 200°C (or 390°F).
6. Cook the skewers until getting clear juice out of the chicken when you poke it. If you are baking it, put the skewers under the broiler or grill and crisp up the skewers.

Serve it with some fresh salad and a baked potato, and enjoy ;)

This recipe doesn't claim to be authentic. It doesn't use corn tortillas (we don't like them) and there may be a few other non-traditional methods. However, all the ingredients are easy to find and it's a great comfort meal. You could easily substitute any already cooked protein or veggies and use the same sauce.  


My boyfriend and I eat 2 each for dinner and then take leftovers for lunch.

 

### Ingredients

#### Shredded Chicken

* 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs
* 1 cup of chicken broth or water

#### Enchilada Sauce

* 2 tablespoons all purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons chile powder
* 2 cups of room temperature water
* 6 oz of tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 medium onion chopped
* 3 cloves garlic minced
* 2-3 tablespoons canola oil
* 2 cans 4.5 oz each green chiles
* 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter

#### Enchiladas

* 6-8 whole wheat 8 inch tortillas
* 1 ½ cup monterey jack cheese divided

#### Toppings

* Sour cream
* Sliced avocado
* Cilantro
* Hot sauce
* Fresh slices of limes

### Instructions

#### Shredded Chicken

1. In a pressure cooker add in boneless skinless chicken thighs and the broth.
2. Seal pressure cooker and set pressure to high for 20 minutes.
3. Do a quick release after 5-10 minutes.
4. Remove the chicken from the juices and shred with two forks in a separate bowl. Keep separated.

#### Enchilada Sauce

1. While the chicken is cooking, begin the enchilada sauce. In a small bowl mix together flour and chile powder.
2. In a medium mixing bowl mix together the water, tomato paste, cumin and salt.
3. Preheat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once heated, add in the canola oil and onions. Allow to soften for 2 minutes.
4. Next add in garlic and continue to stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.
5. Add in the flour mixture and whisk to form a roux. If the mixture seems too dry, add 1 tablespoon more canola oil. Simmer for one minute.
6. Carefully add in water mixture and whisk to combine. Let the sauce come to a simmer and add in both cans of chiles, including the juice from both cans and stir together.
7. Reduce the heat to medium low and let reduce and thicken for 5-8 minutes.
8. Take the saucepan off the heat and add the peanut butter. Stir well to combine.

#### Enchiladas

1. Once the chicken is cooked and sauce is done cooking, preheat the oven to 400 F.
2. Spray a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish with cooking spray.
3. To the shredded chicken, add ½ cup of the monterey jack cheese and 1 cup of the enchilada sauce and mix it well.
4. Take a tortilla and use a ⅓ cup measuring cup to portion out chicken/cheese/sauce mixture. Add the mixture in a row down one side of the tortilla. Roll tortilla up and place in the pan, seam side down.
5. Repeat until you have 6-8 tortillas in the pan. The pan may not be completely full of tortillas.
6. Place the enchiladas in the oven uncovered for 15 minutes.
7. Remove the pan from the oven and add the rest of the enchilada sauce over the rolled up tortillas. Top evenly with cheese and bake uncovered for another 15-20 minutes until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling.
8. Allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with your favorite toppings like sour cream, sliced avocado, cilantro and/or hot sauce.

### Notes

* If you are using already cooked and shredded chicken, this recipe uses about 2 cups of chicken.
* You can substitute chicken breast in this recipe.
* Shredded chicken can be made in the slow cooker on high for 4-6 hours and shredded or low for 8 hours and shredded.
* The sauce can be made ahead of time and stored in the fridge for 3-4 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fdfj3k/homemade_chicken_enchiladas_with_homemade_sauce/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fdfj3k/homemade_chicken_enchiladas_with_homemade_sauce/

2. Slice the chicken into long strips that are between 0.5 and 1cm wide and mix it with the marinade. Let marinate for 30 minutes.
3. While it marinates, prepare the sauce by mixing all the ingredients in a sauce pan and bring it to a simmer. Leave it to simmer until the chicken is fried.
4. Dice the onions and the bell peppers into bite size pieces.
5. When the chicken strips are marinated, add half a cup of starch to it and mix well. Separate the strips and let them rest for a couple of minute.
6. Preheat some oil at 190°C (or 380°F).
7. Roll the strips in the remaining starch and shake off any excess and deep-fry the strips in batches for 2 minutes.
8. After 2 minutes, remove the strips from the oil and let them rest on a cooling rack.
9. When all the strips have been fried a first time, fry them all once more for 1 minutes.
10. In a pan, preheat some oil on high heat and stir-fry the onion and bell pepper pieces for 3 minutes.
11. Add the fried chicken strips and the sauce. Mix well and serve.

Enjoy ;)

I seriously recommend using freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano  or at least freshly grated parmesan 

Serve with veggies, salad or flavored quinoa/rice.

&amp;#x200B;

### Ingredients

* 1 ½ cups freshly grated parmigiano reggiano
* 2 tablespoons dried Italian seasoning
* 2 tablespoons garlic paste or 6 cloves finely grated
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 2 large eggs beaten
* Kosher salt to taste

### Instructions

1. Mix together the parmesan, Italian seasoning, garlic paste and paprika until well mixed in a shallow bowl. At first the garlic will be clumpy but keep mixing until it is all incorporated.
2. Cut the chicken breasts in half widthwise and then cut each of those pieces into 4 or 6 pieces depending on how big the chicken breast is. Make sure the chicken is cut into even pieces to make sure they cook evenly.
3. Preheat the air fryer to 400 F.
4. While the air fryer is preheating, beat the eggs and place them in a shallow bowl.
5. Season the cut pieces of chicken well with kosher salt. Dip a piece of chicken into the egg and allow some excess to drip off.
6. Next coat the chicken in the cheese mixture. Shake off any excess and set aside on a plate. Repeat with the rest of the chicken pieces.
7. Once all the chicken is coated, spray the inside basket with an oil spray to prevent the chicken from sticking. Place the chicken pieces in a single layer in the basket and bake for 5 minutes. If all the pieces do not fit in a single layer, make in multiple batches.
8. Flip the chicken pieces and cook for an additional 4-5 minutes until 155-160 F internally. Allow the chicken to rest for 5 minutes. The chicken is done once the crust is golden brown and delicious looking.
9. If cooking in batches, repeat until all chicken is done.
10. Serve with roasted vegetables, sides or on salad.

### Notes

* Make sure to mix the cheese mixture completely until all the garlic paste is incorporated.
* Cut chicken into even pieces to ensure even cooking.
* Cook chicken in a single layer to get good airflow. If necessary, bake in batches.
* Boneless skinless chicken thighs can be used but may change the cooking time.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/f0bqhi/air_fryer_parm_crusted_chicken/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/f0bqhi/air_fryer_parm_crusted_chicken/

2-3 pounds chicken legs, thighs and/or wings

3 Tbsp vegetable oil

1 large yellow or white onion, sliced

A 3-inch piece of ginger, peeled and minced

6-8 garlic cloves, chopped roughly

2-3 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks

1 15-ounce can of crushed tomatoes

1 quart chicken stock

1 cup peanut butter

1 cup roasted peanuts

1 Tbsp ground coriander

1 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste

Salt and black pepper

1/4 to 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro





METHODS

1 Brown the chicken. Heat the vegetable oil in a large soup pot set over medium-high heat. Salt the chicken pieces well, pat them dry and brown them in the oil. Don't crowd the pot, so do this in batches. Set the chicken pieces aside as they brown.
2 Sauté the vegetables. Sauté the onions in the oil for 3-4 minutes, stirring often and scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pot. Add the ginger and garlic and sauté another 1-2 minutes, then add the sweet potatoes and stir well to combine.
3 Cook the stew. Add the chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, peanut butter, peanuts, coriander and cayenne and stir well to combine. Add the chicken. Bring to a simmer and taste for salt, adding more if needed.
Cover the pot and simmer gently for 90 minutes (check after an hour), or until the chicken meat easily falls off the bone and the sweet potatoes are tender.
4 Remove bones and chop the cooked chicken. Remove the chicken pieces and set them in a bowl to cool, until cool enough to touch. Remove and discard the skin if you want, or chop it and put it back into the pot.
Shred the meat off the bones and put the meat back in the pot.
5 Adjust seasonings. Adjust the seasonings for salt and cayenne, then add as much black pepper as you think you can stand—the stew should be peppery. Stir in the cilantro and serve by itself, or with simple steamed rice.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/dz4p9a/african_penut_butter_chicken_stew/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/dz4p9a/african_penut_butter_chicken_stew/

Brown Onions: (Note 1)

2 large Onions, sliced evenly

1/2 cup Vegetable Oil

Chicken Marinade:

700 grams Chicken Thighs and Drumsticks, bone-in and skinless (Note 2)

3/4 cup Yogurt (or hung curd)

1/4 cup Tomato Puree

1/4 cup Vegetable Oil

1 tablespoon Ginger Garlic Paste (minced ginger and garlic)

1 tablespoon Red Chilli Powder (sub with 1 teaspoon Paprika + 1 teaspoon Cayenne)

1 teaspoon Turmeric Powder

1 teaspoon Garam Masala Powder

2 tablespoon Brown Onions

1 1/4 teaspoon Salt

Saffron:

2 tablespoon Hot Milk

10–15 Saffron strands

Parboiled Rice (70% cooked):

2 cups Basmati Rice (Note 3)

6 cups Water

2 tablespoon Salt

1 Bayleaf

5–6 Cloves

2–3 Cardamom Pods

Other Biryani Ingredients:

1 cup fresh Mint Leaves

1 cup fresh Coriander Leaves (Cilantro)

1 1/2 tablespoons Ghee (or Butter)

To Serve:

Crispy Brown Onions

Onion Raita

INSTRUCTIONS

Brown Onions: To make the brown onions, pat the onions dry and if time permits, leave them out on a kitchen towel for 15-20 minutes to dry them out slightly. Heat oil in a pan and add the onions. On a medium flame, shallow fry the onions for 15 minutes till they are a deep golden brown, without burning them. Drain them out on a paper towel, and set aside. These can be made ahead and stored in an air tight container overnight. Burnt onions will add a bitter flavour to the biryani. You can also use store bought fried onions/ shallots which are easily available in leading supermarkets, Indian and Asian stores.

Marinate Chicken: Mix together all the ingredients under chicken marinade and marinate for at least two hours or overnight for best results.

Saffron: When you are ready to make the biryani, soak saffron strands in hot milk and rub them slightly with the back of a spoon. Set this aside.

Parboiled Rice:  Bring water to a roaring boil and add salt, whole spices and basmati rice. Cook for exactly 5 minutes and drain completely, leaving the whole spices in the rice. This will cook the rice to about 70% doneness which can be checked by pressing a grain of rice between two fingers – the rice should still be raw in the middle.

Layering and Cooking Chicken Biryani: Heat a heavy bottomed pot like a dutch oven, and add the chicken to it. Cook for 4 minutes and then turn the chicken pieces once. Cover and cook for another 3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Scatter half the onions all over the chicken, and then all the coriander and mint leaves. Next layer the rice all over the mint and coriander, and in the end drizzle saffron milk and ghee all over the rice. Cover and cook on a low flame for 20 minutes – this will help steam the rice, cook it to doneness and cook the chicken. (Note 4)

To Finish: Once the biryani is cooked, let it rest for 5 minutes, and finish by scattering the remaining onions on top. Serve hot with your favourite raita.

NOTES

While a lot of restaurants use an entire chicken cut into medium sized pieces to make biryani, this is done to cut costs. Pieces like chicken breasts dry out during the long cooking process, and that’s why I recommend using only chicken thighs and drumsticks while cooking biryani at home. You can ask your butcher to cut each chicken leg into two parts to divide it into thighs and drumsticks. Leaving the bone in keeps the chicken juicy.

Brown Onions can be slightly time consuming and tricky to make, and you can substitute them here with store bought fried onions. Just make sure that the onions are not batter fried. If you are in India, you can buy them online here, and if you live outside India, you can buy them here. They are also available at leading supermarkets, Asian and Indian stores.

While buying basmati rice, make sure you buy rice that’s labelled basmati and not just long grain rice. Basmati Rice is fragrant and has slightly thinner grains than long grain rice. Real basmati rice is what gives biryani its distinct flavour and taste.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/d79t5c/chicken_biryani_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/d79t5c/chicken_biryani_recipe/

1 pack (1lb) of Spaghetti

2 large Chicken breasts

1 tbsp grated garlic (about 4 cloves)

1/2 tbsp grated fresh ginger (about an inch)

1/2 tsp turmeric powder

1 tsp cumin seeds

4 dry red chili peppers

10-15 curry leaves (can use Thai basil instead)

2 cans (14oz each) Coconut milk

1/2 a lime

Salt to taste

**For the toppings/ garnishes**

6 eggs

6 cloves garlic

2-3 shallots

2-3 green onions

handful of chopped cilantro

lime wedges

1-2 chili peppers

3-4 tbsps vegetable oil for frying

**Instructions**

– Start by cutting the chicken breasts into small bite sized pieces and toss them in a bowl.

– Add 1 tablespoon of freshly grated garlic and half that of freshly grated ginger to the chicken.

– Sprinkle over the turmeric powder and some salt. Mix everything well so that all the chicken pieces are coated in the marinade. Let the chicken sit in the fridge, marinating while you get everything else ready.

– Next, prepare all the toppings and garnishes. Hard boil the eggs, roughly chop the cilantro and finely slice the green onion and chili peppers at an angle. Set them aside in little condiment bowls.

– Finely slice the shallots and garlic (I used a mandolin slicer).

– Heat 3-4 tablespoons of oil in a small wok/skillet. Then fry the garlic slices until they turn a light golden. Remove them as soon as they turn golden (it’s literally a few seconds from golden to burnt) using a slotted spoon and place them on a paper napkins to drain the excess oil.

– Separate the onion layers, into strands and fry them in the same oil the same way you fried the garlic, until it turns golden. It’s best to do them in batches if your pan is small so that it browns evenly. Remove the fried onion with a slotted spoon and drain it as well.

– Transfer the same oil (now flavored with garlic and onion) to a large pot. We’ll use it to brown the chicken and make the sauce.

– In the meantime, boil your spaghetti according to the instructions on the packet. you can use chinese style egg noodles, but I’ve always just preferred spaghetti for this dish although it’s not traditional.

– Once the oil is hot in the big pot, work quickly and add the cumin seeds, dried red peppers and curry leaves to the oil. They’ll immediately start sputtering and will brown quick so give it a stir.

– Add the marinated chicken pieces and fry them with the spices until they turn white or brown slightly..

– Lower the heat to low-medium and pour in the 2 cans of coconut milk (I used one regular and one can of lite coconut milk) and season it with salt. Bring it up to a simmer, stirring occasionally.

– Once the sauce has been simmering for about 10 minutes and the chicken is cooked through, turn off the heat. You can add the noodles to the sauce and mix it together or serve the sauce separately….but before you do squeeze the juice of half a lime into the sauce for a touch of tanginess. It lifts up the whole dish, I promise!

– Serve the noodles hot with all the assortment of condiments/toppings/garnishes so everyone can customize the dish to their taste. I personally like all the toppings…and lots of it!

For example, I LOVE this recipe, and it's only soy sauce, honey and ketchup. (All of which are at the dollar store or places like Aldis.)

Heck even roasting with only salt and pepper, maybe a lemon or whatever spices you have on hand, served on top of rice would be delicious.

EDITED- My reading skills suck tonight. I saw your no oven problem at the end. Do you have a slow cooker? Recipe above would be good in a slow cooker as well. You can also ""roast"" chicken in a slow cooker, if you set the chicken on a rack, tin foil balls or vegetables. (Sliced onions or potatoes.) You can sear the chicken before hand.

#Ingredients for Harissa Chicken with Cabbage and Tomatoes

**Harissa Chicken:**

1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil

4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs

1 heaping tablespoon harissa paste

2 teaspoons lemon juice (or water)

Salt and pepper to taste

**Cabbage and Tomatoes:**

1 yellow onion, peeled and diced

4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

2 Yukon gold potatoes, small-diced

1 small head of green cabbage (or 1/2 a medium head of cabbage), cored and roughly chopped

1 tablespoon harissa

1 teaspoon cumin

1 teaspoon paprika

1 1/2 cups chicken stock

1 pound fresh Roma tomatoes (or 1 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes)

2 tablespoons butter

Salt and pepper to taste

#Method

##Cook the Chicken:

Preheat oven to 425ºF. 

Combine the harissa and lemon juice to thin it out. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Spoon the harissa paste on to the skins of the chicken and use the back of your spoon to spread it evenly across the skin.

In a wide, ovenproof sauté pan, heat the neutral cooking oil over medium heat until very hot. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook for 5 minutes without moving or until the skin begins to crisp up and char a bit. Flip and cook an additional 2 minutes.
Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.

##Prepare the Crushed Tomatoes (Optional):

While the chicken is frying, bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the tomatoes and boil until the skins split. Remove the tomatoes and transfer them to an ice bath or run them under very cold tap water. Once they are cool enough to handle, remove the skins and core.

Transfer the tomatoes to a bowl and crush them with your hands. Set aside.

##Cook the Aromatics:

Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of the chicken fat in the sauté pan. Return the heat on the pan to medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until softened. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.

##Fry the Vegetables:
Add the potatoes and cabbage to the pot and cook until the potatoes begin to soften and the cabbage begins to char, about 6-7 minutes.

Season everything with salt, pepper, cumin, and paprika. Add the harissa and toss to coat everything with the paste.

##Deglaze the Pan:

Pour in the chicken stock and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom. Bring to a boil and then add the butter and tomatoes and toss to combine.

Taste and season to your preferences. Turn off the heat.

##Bake the Chicken:

Nestle the chicken into the cabbage and tomatoes, skin-side up. Transfer to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes or until an instant read thermometer reaches 165ºF.

##To Serve:

Divide the cabbage and tomatoes between bowls and serve with a harissa chicken thigh on top. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/cqt960/harissa_chicken_with_cabbage_and_tomatoes/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/cqt960/harissa_chicken_with_cabbage_and_tomatoes/

Vegetable oil of choice, for frying the chicken

6 cups all-purpose flour

5 tablespoons salt

4 tablespoons ground black pepper

2 tablespoons garlic powder

1 tablespoon onion powder

2 teaspoons cayenne pepper

2 cups buttermilk

Text Ingredients


Directions

1.   Cut the whole chickens into 4 breasts, 4 thighs, 4 legs and 4 wings and set aside.

2.   Preheat your oil, in either a heavy pan on the stove or a deep-fryer, to 325 degrees F.

3.   In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and cayenne pepper until thoroughly mixed. Set aside.

4    Pour the buttermilk into another bowl large enough for the chicken to be immersed in the buttermilk.

5.   Prepare your dredging station. Place your chicken in a bowl. Next to that, your bowl of buttermilk, and next to that, your dry mixture.

6.    Take your breasts, lightly dust them with your flour mixture, then dip them in the buttermilk until they are coated, and then place them in the flour mixture.

7    Take the breasts that are in the flour mixture and aggressively push the flour mixture into the wet chicken. Make sure that the chicken in very thoroughly coated, or you will not achieve the crust and crunch you are looking for. Gently place the breasts in your hot oil.

8    Next, repeat the dredging steps with your other pieces of chicken in this order: thigh, leg then wing.

9.   When you place the last wing into the fryer, you should have 16 pieces of chicken in the oil. Set a timer for 15 minutes.

10.   After 15 minutes, take a probe thermometer and check the temperature of a breast. If it reads 180 degrees F, all of your chicken is done. (Keep in mind that it will continue to cook after it has been removed from the fryer.)

11.   Remove the chicken from the oil and let it drain for 5 minutes. Let cool for an additional 10 minutes before serving.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/cftjz2/fried_chicken/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/cftjz2/fried_chicken/

## chicken

1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cubed

## marinade

1 cup Greek yogurt, thick

1 1/2 teaspoons garlic, minced

1 1/2 teaspoons fresh ginger, minced

1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder

½ teaspoon garam masala powder

salt

2 tablespoons mustard oil

1 tablespoon lemon juice

## for the onions

2 tablespoons sunflower oil

1 red onion, sliced thinly

2 serrano peppers, sliced lengthwise with seeds for more spice

2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped

## for the curry

½ stick butter or ghee (1/4 cup)

1 tablespoon pav bhaji masala

1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder

1 teaspoon ground turmeric

1 teaspoon ground cumin

3 Roma tomatoes, peeled and chopped (or use tomato puree)

3 tablespoons tomato paste

1 cup water

½ cup heavy cream, to 1 cup

salt, to taste

# METHOD

## THE CHICKEN

* Add all the ingredients for the marinade to a bowl and toss to coat the cubed chicken. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight, preferably. Skewer the chicken and grill to get a nice char and it’s cooked through. Set aside until needed.

## SAUTÉED VEGETABLES

* In a sauté pan on medium-high heat, fry the onion and serrano pepper until golden brown, stir in the cilantro. Remove from the pan and set aside.

## THE CURRY

* Add the butter to the same pan and allow to melt. Add the spices followed by the fresh tomato and tomato paste, stir well to combine. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes, letting some of the liquid evaporate to concentrate the flavors. Add 1 cup of water, cover and reduce heat to a simmer for 15 minutes.
* Add grilled chicken pieces and stir cream in, if desired. Taste, adjust seasoning and salt, if needed.

## TO SERVE

* Spoon a serving of basmati rice onto a plate and ladle the curry beside it. Top with the sautéed vegetables. Alternatively, omit the rice and serve with naan.

## NOTES

* A stovetop gas oven tandoor (available online) can be used to grill bone-in skinless chicken thighs.
* The onion-pepper mixture may be combined with the curry instead of spooning it on top.

This is actually a variation of something called Tlapleno soup!

Ingredients:

1 Tbs of olive oil

1/2 purple onion

2 small carrots

2 medium stalks of celery

4 - 5 cups of chicken stock (if you don't have chicken stock, you can use water with about a 3/4 Tbs of chicken bouillon- or to taste. I like Knorr pollo or Better Than Bouillon)

2 - 3 small bay leaves

1 large chicken breast

1 can of chickpeas - drained

few sprigs of cilantro

Salt and pepper to taste

Chop the onion, carrots, and celery and add to the heated pan with the olive oil - saute for 5ish minutes and then add the chicken stock, bay leaves, cilantro sprigs, s &amp; p if needed, and chickpeas and bring to a simmer. Let vegetables cook until tender. Meanwhile, cook the chicken however you like (boil or in this case I used rotisserie chicken) and shred into bite size pieces. Remove the wilted cilantro, bay leaves, and add the chicken and cook for another 5 minutes or until soup is heated through again.

&amp;#x200B;

This is typically garnished with fresh lime juice, chopped cilantro, avocado, sliced radish - and if you want some heat, finely minced serrano pepper.

If you're grilling outdoors, you may also want to pat it dry as per [Chef John's barbeque chicken recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpS5mHJBQDE). Even if you're grilling indoors, he gives good advice to grill skin side up for a few minutes and roasting the rest of the way (while basting as per the written recipe).

The yogurt in the dressing makes helps to tenderize the meat so even though it got a good char on the grill, it was still really juice. Definitely the best grilled chicken we’ve ever made.

[https://www.nerdswithknives.com/green-goddess-grilled-chicken-red-onions/](https://www.nerdswithknives.com/green-goddess-grilled-chicken-red-onions/)

Serves 4-6

Ingredients

For the Green Goddess marinade

* 1 medium garlic clove, roughly chopped (or 1 stalk green garlic)
* 4 scallions, roughly chopped
* 1/4 cup coarsely chopped chives (1 small bunch)
* 1/4 cup coarsely chopped basil (about 20 leaves)
* 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped parsley
* 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped mint
* 4 anchovy filets, roughly chopped
* 1-1/2 cups greek yogurt
* 3/4 cup mayonnaise
* 3 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 lemon)
* 1 teaspoon lemon zest (from 1/2 lemon)
* Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste
* 2 to 3 tablespoons water, if needed

For the chicken

* 1-1/2 pounds chicken breasts or thighs
* 2 large red onions, cut into 1/2-inch thick rings
* 1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions

Make the marinade / dressing:

1. Add garlic clove (or chopped green garlic), scallions, and herbs to the bowl of a food processor or blender. Pulse about 10 to 12 times, until herbs are finely minced. Add anchovies, yogurt, mayonnaise, lemon juice and zest and process until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down bowl as needed. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper to taste. If dressing is too thick, add a couple of tablespoons water. You should be able to drizzle it off a spoon. Set aside. Note: dressing can be made up to 3 days ahead.
2. Cut chicken breasts in half lengthwise, making two thinner cutlets. Place each cutlet between 2 pieces of plastic wrap and pound until even and about 1/4-inch thick. Add pounded chicken to a sealable plastic bag and pour about a cup of the marinade into bag. Move the chicken around, making sure every piece is coated, then seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, and up to 24 hours. Transfer the rest of the dressing to a sealable jar and refrigerate.
3. Prepare a grill for high heat and take the chicken out of the refrigerator. Brush onions with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. When grill is hot, clean and oil grill grates. Grill chicken and onions until cooked through and brown in spots, about 4 to 5 minutes each side, depending on how hot your grill gets. Transfer chicken and onions to a clean platter and drizzle some of the reserved dressing over. Serve warm or room temperature.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/8wkq8k/basil_green_goddess_grilled_chicken_with_red/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/8wkq8k/basil_green_goddess_grilled_chicken_with_red/

Get a couple of Turkey Breasts (Skinless or remove the skin).  not sure what flavors you really like at the Deli but you can brine some flavor into them before you roast.  like say a Cajun Spiced turkey breast.  Using a container large enough to be able to completely cover the breast with water and seal and refrigerate overnight.  you would add 1 to 2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, (the salt will force the liquids from the turkey then the seasoning and water will be forced back into it and will flavor it.)  so that being said after you brine overnight remove from the water dump the water.  Let it dry a bit and warm a little closer to room temp.  drizzle olive oil and rub on all sides then season with a little or a lot of the same seasoning all over the turkey breast.  To Roast Preheat the oven to 450 and move the rack to the bottom 3rd of the oven.  once preheated turn down to 350 and add the turkey breast.  cook for 1 hour or until the breast is browned and temp in thickest part is 165 degrees.  I would start checking after about 45 to 50 minutes.  remove from oven and cover with foil to let it rest and rehydrate.  then once cooled slice as thin as you like and you can freeze or just make enough for you sammies for the week.

8jz2ha,SPRING ROLLS! The perfect recipe for Spring,9,1,1526509265.0,0.85,Poultry,jefflan,https://imgur.com/Gy9Rt7m,"**INGREDIENTS**

150g roughly sliced mushrooms 
2 carrots in Julianne 
10 small radishes in quarters or eight 
2-3 spring onions (green part)
2 eggs
300g chicken

Seasoning

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon cayenne  
1 tap paprika


**PREPARATION**

**Season**

Add all the powders to a small bowl, and mix everything throughly 

**Chicken**

Cut chicken into thin slices (about 1inch thick*2 inch long) and add seasoning.
For a better flavor, let your chicken absorb  all the flavors for at least 2 hours or overnight.

**Eggs** 

Beat 2 eggs in a bowl, followed by a splash of fish sauce, salt and pepper.

**Cooking**

Once the chicken is ready, pre-heat a frying at medium heat pan and add some cooking oil.

Cook for around 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden.

After the chicken is done, grab it and put it aside, and on the same pan, add  extra oil, and add the eggs.

Cook at medium heat until the eggs are ready.

**Plate it!**

For the paper rice to be eaten, it needs to be soaking in water for about 30 seconds or until soggy, so make sure you find a try that’s long enough to add luke-warm water.

Once the rice paper is ready, take it out of the water, shake the excess and bring it to a plate.

Around the middle of the sheet, add your veggies, chicken and egg in a way that allows you to roll it (aligned from one extreme to the other)

Roll it by bringing the extremes where the content begins and ends towards the middle to avoid spillage. Grab one of the extremes and tuck it under the content and cover the roll with the remaining extreme.

If you’re more of a visual learner, like myself, I made a **Video** about it:

   * 6 tablespoons butter softened
   * 2 cloves garlic roughly chopped + more for roasting if desired
   * 1/2 cup fresh basil chopped
   * 1/2 cup parmesan cheese grated

   * 1/3 cup fresh basil chopped
   * 2 cloves garlic chopped
   * 1 anchovy fillet
   * 1 tablespoon chopped drained capers
   * 1 teaspoon kosher salt

***

**Instructions**

**Chicken**

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
    
2. On a cutting board, combine the garlic and basil. Use a knife to roughly chop/combine the garlic and basil together. Add to a bowl with the butter and parmesan. Stir in a pinch of salt.
    
3. Place the chicken thighs on a roasting pan. Run your fingers under the skin of each chicken thigh to create a pocket. Stuff each pocket with about a tablespoon of the butter mixture, gently spreading it underneath the skin and on top of the chicken thigh.
    
4. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon zest, thyme, parsley, oregano, crushed red pepper, and a pinch of salt. Brush the mixture over the skin of the chicken, reserve any extra for brushing on while cooking. If desired, scatter a few garlic cloves and bay leaves in between the chicken on the roasting pan. Roast for 30-40 minutes or until the chicken is cooked throughout and the skin is golden. I brushed my chicken with the remaining olive oil/lemon sauce half way through cooking.
    
5. About 20 minutes before the chicken is done, toss the asparagus with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt and pepper. Place in a small baking dish and roast for 20 minutes or until tender and lightly charred.

**Charred Lemon Salsa Verde**

    
1. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the salsa verde. On a baking sheet, toss the lemon slices with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Spread the lemon slices in an even layer and bake for 15 to 20 minutes (you can do this in the same oven with the chicken) or until charred on the bottom. 
2. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool for 5 minutes. 
3. Finely chop the lemon slices into small bite size pieces. Add to a bowl along with the parsley, oregano, basil, garlic, anchovy, capers and salt. Add the olive oil. Stir to combine, taste and adjust salt as needed.

**To serve**

1. Once the chicken has finished roasting, remove from the oven and plate. Serve alongside the salsa verde. I served my chicken alongside roasted asparagus and a quick risotto.

**Ingredients**

   * chicken thighs or drumsticks (a mix) 12
   * olive oil for frying
   * onions 2, finely chopped
   * garlic 4 cloves, crushed
   * vine tomatoes 800g, peeled and chopped, or 2 x 400g tin tomatoes
   * red peppers 2, seeded and sliced
   * rosemary 2 sprigs, needles chopped
   * red wine 300ml
   * pitted black olives 120g jar, drained and halved
   * basil a handful of leaves

***
**Directions**

1. Season the chicken pieces all over. Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large shallow casserole or frying pan and fry the chicken on both sides until the skin is golden brown, about 10 minutes. You may need to do this in batches. 

2. Transfer from the pan onto a plate. Drain most of the fat from the pan, add the onions and garlic, and fry for 8 minutes on a low heat until the onions are soft. 

3. Add the tomatoes, peppers and rosemary and simmer for another 10 minutes until the tomatoes break down. Add the wine and simmer for 20-30 minutes until it thickens and becomes a rich sauce. Add a splash of water if it becomes too thick. 

4. Heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5.

5. Stir the olives through the sauce, then nestle the chicken back into the pan. If the pieces don’t fit in one layer, transfer the sauce and chicken to a baking dish. 

6. Cook in the oven for 30-40 minutes or until cooked through and the meat pulls away from the bone easily. Allow to cool to room temperature, then tip into freezer boxes in portions, or freeze the whole baking dish covered in clingflim then foil, if you like.

7. To reheat, allow to thaw overnight in the fridge. Heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Tip into an ovenproof dish (add another splash of water if the sauce has thickened too much when cooled), and cook for 30-40 minutes until piping hot. Scatter over some basil, and serve with pasta or potatoes.

**Cook's notes:** Peel the vine tomatoes by pouring a kettleful of boiling water over the tomatoes in a large bowl. Blanch for 30 seconds - 1 minute until the skins burst. Drain, cool and the skins will peel off easily.

* 2 tablespoons honey
* 1 tablespoon grated or minced peeled fresh ginger
* 3 small cloves garlic, grated or minced (about 1 tablespoon)
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch
* 3 cups cooked rice

***
**Directions**

1. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a 3 1/2- to 5 1/2-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onions, broccoli, and carrots and sauté until the broccoli is a bright green and the carrots are still crisp but slightly tender, about 2 minutes.

2. Add the zucchini, snow peas, and sprouts and cook, stirring, until heated through, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large plate and set aside.

3. Sprinkle the chicken with the salt and pepper on both sides.

4. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in the same Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the chicken in a single layer and cook until browned on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes total.

5. Add 1/2 cup of the chicken broth, soy sauce, mirin, brown sugar, honey, ginger, and garlic. Stir and scrape up any flavorful browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to low and cook just until the mixture comes to a gentle boil, 2 to 3 minutes.

6. Cover, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook until the chicken is just cooked through and no longer pink, 5 to 6 minutes.

7. Whisk the cornstarch with the remaining 3 tablespoons chicken broth in a small bowl until fully combined. Stir the chicken and sauce in the Dutch oven, and drizzle in the cornstarch mixture. Increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil, stirring the liquid constantly, 1 to 2 minutes.

8. Add the rice and reserved vegetables and stir to combine. Cover and cook until the rice has begun to absorb the sauce, the vegetables are cooked to the desired doneness, and the chicken is soft and tender, about 3 to 5 minutes.

You can tweak the cayenne to change the level of heat. Also be careful of it falling over after it starts to cook. The base onion gets soft. Reinforce it maybe? I would lean closer to the 90 minute cooking mark. 2 hours seems a bit too long, it might get dried out.

Thai massaman curry uses mostly Middle Eastern spices, which create a warmth instead of a fiery burn.
Adding peanuts at the end helps them retain their crunch.

Serves 6 to 8 

**Ingredients**

   * 1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil
   * 2 medium red onions (about 3/4 pound), cut pole to pole into 8 wedges each
   * 8 ounces massaman curry paste (about 1/2 cup; 300g)
   * 1 (12-ounce; 355ml) bottle Belgian-style wheat beer
   * 1 (14-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
   * 3/4 cup (175ml) homemade chicken stock or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock
   * 3 tablespoons (45ml) Asian fish sauce
   * 2 1/2 tablespoons (30g) palm or light brown sugar
   * 2 star anise pods
   * 1 cinnamon stick
   * 8 to 10 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 3 pounds; 1.5kg), cut into large pieces
   * 1 1/2 pounds (700g) red or Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into large chunks
   * 1/2 cup (75g) roasted unsalted peanuts
   * 3 tablespoons (45ml) fresh juice from about 2 limes, plus lime wedges for garnish
   * Kosher salt, to taste
   * Steamed or boiled rice, for serving
   * 1 cup (30g) lightly packed cilantro leaves and tender stems, for garnish
   * Fried shallots, for garnish (optional)

**Directions**

1. In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened slightly and golden brown in spots, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate.

2. Add curry paste and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Stir in beer and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Add coconut milk, chicken stock, fish sauce, sugar, star anise, cinnamon stick, chicken, and potatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.

3. Add onions back to pot and continue simmering, uncovered, until potatoes are tender and chicken is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Remove from heat.

   * 1 medium white onion, finely chopped

   * 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

   * 1½ Tbsp (20 mL) smoked paprika

**Directions**

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). In an ovenproof fry pan (or cast iron pan) over medium/high heat add a good splash of olive oil. Pat chicken on both sides with a paper towel to remove excess moisture, season generously with salt and pepper on both sides and add to the pan. Be sure not to crowd the pan or the chicken will steam and not sear. Sear the chicken in batches if required. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes on both sides or until golden brown. Remove pieces and set aside.
    
2. Remove excess oil from the pan, or add more olive oil if needed. Over medium heat add onions, garlic, smoked paprika, and cumin. Stir for 3 to 5 minutes or until onions become transparent, but not browned. Then add lentils, stock, tomatoes, bay leaves, chili flakes, and chicken pieces. Slide into oven and bake for 20 to 25 mins (do not add a lid to the pan). Check chicken and lentils for doneness. Turn oven off and turn on broiler feature. Brown up the tomatoes for a minute or so then remove pan from oven and check lentils for seasoning. Garnish with finely chopped parsley and extra chili flakes to taste.

Servings: 4 - 5 people

**Ingredients**

   * 4 large / 5 small chicken thighs , bone in skin on (Note 1)
   * 1/2 cup / 80 g brown sugar , loosely packed
   * 1 tbsp water
   * 400 g / 14 oz coconut milk , low fat (1 can) (Note 2)
   * 1 1/2 tbsp fish sauce (Note 3)
   * 2 1/2 tbsp rice vinegar (or cider vinegar)
   * 2 garlic cloves , minced

   * 1/4 tsp white pepper (or black)

**Garnishes (optional):**

   * 1 shallot , finely sliced (green onion / scallion)
   * 1 large red chilli , finely sliced

***
**Instructions**

1. Place sugar and water in a skillet over medium heat. Stir, then when it bubbles and the sugar is melted (it looks like caramel), add the rest of the ingredients except chicken.
    
2. Stir, then put the chicken in SKIN SIDE DOWN.
    
3. Adjust the heat so it is simmering energetically. Not rapidly, not a slow simmer (I use medium high heat on a weak stove, medium on a strong stove).
    
4. After 25 minutes, turn the chicken.
    After another 25 minutes, the fat should separate from the sauce and turn a pale brown (see video).
    
5. Turn chicken so the skin side is down. Move it around so the sauce doesn't catch on the bottom of the skillet and to brown the skin.
    
6. Once sauce and skin is brown, remove from heat.
    
7. Place chicken on serving plates, spoon over some sauce (don't need much, chicken is infused with flavour + sauce is strong).
    
8. Garnish with shallots and chilli, if using. Serve with rice.

The distinctive flavor, texture, and color of this dish are achieved by a particular yogurt marinade, by the use of tenderizers, a special tandoori coloring, and finally, by being cooked in the Indian clay oven.

***

    Makes 6 servings

**Ingredients**

   * 3 very young broiling chickens (about 2 - 2 1/4 pounds each)
   * 2 1/2 teaspoons unseasoned natural meat tenderizer
   * 1/3 cup lemon juice
    
**For marinade**

   * 2 large cloves garlic
   * 1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger root
   * 1 teaspoon ground roasted cumin seeds
   * 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
   * 1/2 teaspoon red pepper
   * 1 teaspoon tandoori coloring, or 1 tablespoon paprika
   * 1/3 cup plain yogurt
   * Usli ghee, Indian vegetable shortening, or light vegetable oil for basting

***
**Preparation**

1. Cut the wings off the chickens. Remove the neckbone carefully. Place the chickens on a cutting board and quarter them neatly. Then pull away the skin, using kitchen towels for a better grip if necessary. (Reserve the wings, neck, and skin for the stockpot.) Prick the chicken all over with a fork or a thin skewer. Make diagonal slashes 1/2-inch deep, 1 inch apart on the meat. Put the meat in a large bowl.
        
2. Add meat tenderizer and lemon juice to the chicken, and rub them into the slashes and all over for 2 minutes. Cover and marinate for 1/2 hour.
        
3. Put all the ingredients of the marinade into the container of an electric blender or food processor, and blend until reduced to a smooth sauce. (Alternatively, garlic and ginger may be crushed to a paste and blended with the remaining ingredients.)
        
4. Pour this marinade over the chicken pieces and mix, turning and tossing, to coat all the pieces well. (_A note of caution:_Since certain brands of _Tandoori_cooking tend to stain the fingers, it is advisable either to use a fork to turn the chicken pieces in the marinade or use a pastry brush to spread it over the chicken.) Cover and marinate for 4 hours at room temperature, or refrigerate overnight, turning several times. Chicken should not remain in the marinade for more than 2 days, because the marinade contains a meat tenderizer which, with prolonged marinating, alters the texture of the chicken meat to very soft and doughy.
        
5. Take the chicken from the refrigerator at least 1 hour before cooking to bring it to room temperature. The chicken is now ready to be either roasted in the oven or broiled over an electric or charcoal grill. 
    
**To Roast in the Oven:**
        
- Start heating the oven to 500°- 550°F. Take the chickens out of the marinade. Brush them with _ghee,_and place them on an extra-large shallow roasting pan, preferably on a wire rack. Set the pan in the middle level of the oven, and roast for 25-30 minutes, or until the meat is cooked through. There is no need to baste while the chicken pieces are roasting, because the enclosed environment keeps the chickens from drying excessively. 
    
**To Broil Indoors:**
        
- Preheat the broiler. Brush the grill with a little oil to prevent the meat's sticking. Place the chicken pieces, slashed side up, on the grill, and brush the slashed side with ghee.Cook 2 to 3 inches away from the heat for 20 minutes. Turn and cook the other side for another 10 minutes, or until the chicken pieces are cooked through. Brush often with ghee during cooking. 
    
**To Grill Outdoors:**
        
- Fire the coal well in advance (about 1 1/2 hours before you are ready to begin cooking), so that a white ash forms over the surface of the coal. This is when the coal is at its hottest. Place the grill at least 5 inches away from the heat, and rub generously with oil. Place the chicken pieces, slashed side up, over the grill and brush them with _ghee._Let chicken cook without turning for 10 minutes. Turn, baste the other side, and cook for 10 minutes. Continue to cook, turning and basting the chicken every 10 minutes, until it is done. The cooking time for broiling and grilling usually varies widely. Much depends upon the intensity of the heat and its distance from the chicken. The point to remember is that the chicken pieces have been marinating in a very strong tenderizing solution for two days and therefore will cook much faster than standard broiled or barbecued chicken.
        
- Serve the chicken immediately, lightly brushed with ghee or oil and accompanied by Roasted Onions.

This is the absolute best perfect weather meal. The acidity from the white balsamic vinegar cuts into the richness of the crème fraîche for a dinner that is simple enough for a night in and elegant enough to serve at a party. 

#GRADE

Serves: 6

Cost: $

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: 1 hour 15 minutes (30 minutes inactive)

#INGREDIENTS

6 whole chicken legs

2 tablespoons olive oil

2 tablespoons butter

3 leeks

1 Vidalia onion

12 ounces baby bella mushrooms

1/3 cup white balsamic vinegar

1 1/2 cups chicken stock

A few sprigs of fresh thyme

1/2 cup crème fraîche (or heavy cream)

1 cup frozen peas

A dash of cayenne powder

#METHOD

Prepare Ingredients: Preheat oven to 400ºF. Pat the chicken dry and season with salt and pepper and set aside. Trim the leeks and cut in half lengthwise and thoroughly wash. Cut into 1'' pieces. Thinly slice the Vidalia onion. Remove the stems from the mushrooms and leave the caps whole or halved. Mince the mushroom stems. Pick the thyme leaves from the stems and discard the stems.

Cook the Chicken: In a large skillet, heat the butter and olive oil over medium high until very hot. Cook the chicken, skin side down, without moving for 5-6 minutes until well browned. Flip and cook an additional 1-2 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and leave the skillet on medium high heat. Note: You may need to cook the chicken in batches for even browning. 

Cook the Vegetables: Add the onions and mushrooms with their stems to the hot skillet and cook for 5 minutes. Add the leeks and cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring regularly, until softened. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Note: The mushrooms will release liquid, continue cooking until almost all the liquid in the skillet has evaporated.

Assemble the Sauce: To the skillet of vegetables, add the white balsamic vinegar and the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Cook for 3 minutes. Remove from heat.

Transfer the vegetable mixture to a large roasting pan. Arrange the chicken legs, skin-side up, on top of the vegetables. Transfer to the oven and cook for 30 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 165ºF in the thickest part of the chicken leg.

Finish the Sauce: Transfer the chicken legs to a serving plate and return the roasting pan with the sauce to a burner on the stove and bring to a boil. Cook for 5 minutes until the liquid has reduced a bit. Stir in the thyme and crème fraîche and cook until thickened, an additional 3-4 minutes. Stir in the peas and cook until bright green and cooked through, about 5 more minutes. Taste and season accordingly and add a dash of cayenne powder if desired. Remove from heat.

To Serve: Add a few ladles of the sauce to bowls and serve with a chicken leg on top. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/7ccgnm/braised_chicken_with_creamy_leeks_mushrooms_and/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/7ccgnm/braised_chicken_with_creamy_leeks_mushrooms_and/

The mushroom recipe follows the chicken recipe!

I LOVED this dinner and if you're looking for a more low-key Thanksgiving Dinner, this is the perfect substitute. The best part is that the entire meal can be whipped up as the mushrooms are baking!

Serves: 2

Cost: $$

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: 35-40 minutes

#INGREDIENTS

Black Garlic And Herb Roasted Mushrooms (recipe at the bottom)

2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts

1-2 tablespoons olive oil


**VELOUTÉ SAUCE**

1 1/2 cups chicken stock

2 tablespoons butter

3 tablespoons flour

Salt and ground white pepper to taste

#METHOD

Prepare Ingredients: Prepare the mushrooms according to the recipe instructions. Pat the chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Microwave the chicken stock for 2-3 minutes until hot.

Cook the Chicken: As the mushrooms are cooking, prepare the chicken. Heat the olive oil in an oven proof skillet until very hot. Ad the chicken breasts and cook without moving for 6-7 minutes until they're well-seared. Flip and transfer to the oven for an additional 7-10 minutes or until the thickest part of the breast reaches 165ºF.

Prepare the Velouté Sauce: Once the chicken is in the oven, prepare the sauce. Heat the butter in a sauce pan until melted, but not browned. Stir in the flour and use a wooden spoon to cook until toasty and lightly browned. It should have a nice, nutty aroma. Add 1/3 of the warm stock and use a whisk to incorporate. Continue adding the stock in 1/3 increments, whisking after each addition, until all the stock as been added. Reduce the heat to low and continue whisking until the sauce is smooth and thickened, about 3-4 minutes more. Taste and season with salt and a touch of white pepper. Strain the sauce through a fine mesh sieve if desired.

Before Serving: Slice the chicken breasts on an angle into thirds.

To Serve: Divide the mushrooms between plates and arrange a sliced chicken breast on top. Spoon the velouté sauce on top of the chicken. Enjoy!

#GRADE

Serves: 2

Cost: $

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: 35 minutes

#INGREDIENTS

1 pound thinly sliced chicken breast

2 eggs

1 teaspoon dijon mustard

1 teaspoon honey

1/2 teaspoon cayenne powder

Salt and pepper to taste

1 cup panko

8-10 cherry tomatoes

1/4 cup olive (or vegetable) oil, plus 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided

2 cups arugula

1 lemon

Sprinkle of sugar, optional

1/2 English cucumber

1/4 cup fresh basil

Shaved parmesan, for serving

#METHOD

Prepare Ingredients: Preheat oven to 400ºF. Toss the cherry tomatoes in 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper on one half of a roasting pan (leaving the other half empty for the chicken) and transfer to the oven for 15-20 minutes. Pat the chicken dry and season with salt and pepper. Thinly slice the cucumber.

Bread the Chicken: In a shallow bowl, whisk the eggs with the honey, dijon mustard, cayenne powder, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. In another shallow bowl, combine the panko with just a touch of salt and pepper. Dip the chicken breasts into the egg mixture, shaking off the excess, and then into the panko, pressing the panko into the chicken to ensure it adheres. Transfer to a plate.

Fry the Chicken: In a large skillet, heat the 1/4 cup of oil over medium high until very hot and almost smoking. Add the chicken, cooking in batches if necessary to avoid over-crowding the skillet, and cook for 3-5 minutes per side until well browned all over. Reduce the heat in the oven to 200ºF and transfer the breasts to the other half of the roasting pan to keep warm.

Prepare the Salad: In a medium bowl, combine the juice of the lemon along with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and whisk until smooth. Season with salt, pepper, and a sprinkle of sugar if desired. Toss the arugula and sliced cucumber in the dressing. Tear the basil leaves and gently toss them with the arugula and cucumber. Set aside

To Serve: Divide the dressed salad between plates and arrange a few roasted tomatoes on top along with the shaved parmesan. Serve with the crispy chicken breasts on the side.

*Dry Ingredients*

* 1 &amp; 1/2 Cups Yellow Cornmeal
* 3/4 Cup All purpose flour
* 3 tbs white sugar
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* Pinch of salt

*Wet ingredients*

* 2 Cups buttermilk
* 6 tbs melted unsalted butter
* 2 Egg yolks
* &amp; 2 Egg whites separated in a large bowl

*Additional ingredients (optional)*

* Canned corn drained (I used)
* Minced Sweet/yellow onions (I used)
* Green onions
* Minced garlic (I used)
* Jalapeno peppers
* Cheddar cheese
* Bell peppers

**For Chicken**

* 4-5 thinly sliced breast's

*Marinade*

* 1 Cup Buttermilk
* Several Tbs Frank's Red Hot

*Dredge*

* 1 &amp; 1/4 Cups Flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tbs onion powder
* 1 tbs garlic powder
* 1 &amp; 1/2 tsp paprika
* Generous pinch salt
* Fresh ground black pepper


1. Stir together wet marinade for chicken and pour over chicken in a container. Let marinate 30 minutes to 1 hour.

2. Combine dry ingredients for waffles &amp; sift into a bowl. Also combine dry ingredients for chicken dredge &amp; set aside

3. Combine wet ingredients for waffles and stir together, remember to separate your eggs. Egg yolks go into the wet ingredients &amp; egg whites in a separate large bowl.

4. Combine your wet waffle into the dry waffle and whisk. Mixture will be slightly lumpy no big deal. Go ahead &amp; turn on your deep fryer/or pan &amp; waffle iron.

5. Get a hand mixer &amp; beat your egg whites until stiff peaks form. **Fold** this mixture into your waffle ingredients 4-5 times. (Add in your extras right after such as your whole corn, peppers, onions and fold additional 3-4 times)

6. Remove chicken from Buttermilk and let excess run off for a few seconds. Dredge both sides in the seasoned flour and set aside for frying.

7. Fry chicken at 350-375F until golden brown. While frying start cooking your waffles until desired doneness is achieved.

8. Have a beer, finish your chicken with some additional salt/pepper if you'd like. Serve with butter/honey/syrup/hot sauce, whatever you desire &amp; enjoy!

**Note:** This really is such an easy recipe, is highly customizable &amp; easy to make. It does have quite a few ingredients but outside of that I encourage everyone to go have some fun &amp; make this for dinner.

Also this makes quite a few waffles I always end up freezing extras and eating them for lunches etc...

This could easily be turned into a sandwich if you wanted to add a slice of cheese &amp; a couple pieces of bacon in between two of these delicious waffles!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/78cz8t/buttermilk_chicken_savory_waffles/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/78cz8t/buttermilk_chicken_savory_waffles/

This was really, really good. The orzo tastes a lot like risotto but extra tasty from having the chicken baked on top of it. 


Prep time:  30 mins Cook time:  45 mins Total time:  1 hour 15 mins

Serves: Serves 4-6

 
Ingredients

4 attached chicken legs and thighs (or 8 separate pieces), skin-on, bone-in (about 2 lb./ 1k)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste


3 tablespoons (45g) unsalted butter, divided

3/4 pound (340g) mixed wild mushrooms (or white button), sliced

2 medium leeks (3/4 lb, 340g), white and pale green parts only, chopped (or a large yellow onion)

3 large garlic cloves, minced

3 teaspoons (3g) fresh thyme leaves (or ½ teaspoon dried)

2 cups (about 10 oz / 285g) orzo

1/2 cup (120ml) dry sherry (or substitute white wine)

3½ cups (830ml) low-sodium chicken broth, divided

2 tablespoons (30ml) fresh lemon juice

2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest (from 1 large lemon)

3 oz (85g) baby spinach

1 lemon, cut into wedges, for garnish



Instructions

Preheat oven to 400°F. Dry chicken well and season generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in a large cast-iron or other ovenproof skillet set over medium-high. Add chicken, skin side down, in a single layer. To get an even sear, place another heavy skillet on top of chicken, pressing it down. Cook until skin is crisp and deep golden brown, 10-12 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and set aside. It will not be fully cooked at this point.

Add mushrooms and leeks and cook, scraping up any brown bits from the pan and stirring occasionally, until leeks are wilted and mushrooms are light brown, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and thyme, season with salt and pepper and cook until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in orzo and cook until toasty smelling, about 3 minutes. Pour in sherry and stir, until liquid is evaporated, about 1 minute. Add 3 cups broth, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes. Nestle chicken back in pan, skin side up and transfer skillet to oven; bake, uncovered, until chicken is cooked through (it should register 165ºF on a thermometer) and orzo is tender, about 15 minutes.

Remove from oven and transfer chicken to a platter. Stir orzo and, if dry, stir in the last ½ cup broth. Stir in lemon juice, zest and remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Fold in baby spinach, a handful at a time, until wilted. Taste orzo for seasoning. Serve with lemon wedges.

I can't really find any reference to this dish anywhere beyond my local area. So this may just be a Bay Area kinda pseudo-Burmese dish. It seems like the word 'kebat' may reference movement of some kind. So it could just be like a generic term for sorta stir-frying?

Either way, I liked it a lot, so I recreated it best I could. Basically just a ground chicken curry. Very simple dish. If you want some video and photos, the original is [here](https://craftlog.com/us/cooking/burmese-chicken-kebat-grzf).

**Ingredients**

- 1 yellow onion
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp crushed black pepper
- 1 tsp kashmiri chili
- 1 lb ground chicken
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 tbsp braggs apple cider vinegar

**Directions**

1. Put little oil in a sautée pan. Medium heat.
2. Add some sliced onions. Let them cook down.
3. Meanwhile, prepare the spices. About a teaspoon each of garam masala, kashmiri chili, and black pepper. I like to use fresh spices as much as possible.
4. Peel and grate a little ginger and mix the ginger with the spices. This smells amazing.
5. When those onions are looking good, soft and a little brown, add the spices. Stir em around a bit. Let them cook gently for a few minutes. Then add the water and just a little vinegar for acidity. Let that reduce.
6. When the water is mostly evaporated, add the ground turkey. The pan should be pretty hot. Cook the meat thoroughly, season it up with a little salt and you're good to go.
7. This stuff is great over rice. I garnished with some green onion.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/75bpdc/chicken_kebat/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/75bpdc/chicken_kebat/

mfmad0,"Frothy, foamy Turkish coffee",2738,78,1617012801.0,0.98,Drink,Other_Exercise,https://i.redd.it/regaqumkzxp61.png,"This is a really detailed recipe to make sure your Turkish coffee is frothy and foamy, as it's meant to be. 

Here's my more visual, sub 5-minute how-to on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZJHKBH9nS8).

**Equipment:**

Turkish coffee pot (known as a cezve, jezve, or ibrik). Use a copper-plated one, like the one in the link, as it spreads out heat better. 

Espresso cup (make sure it’s got a saucer, for a optional cube of Turkish delight) 

Teaspoon

Piece of wood for stirring, such as kebab stick, chopstick, or toothpick
Stove/oven top, preferably gas, but electric and induction also works

**Ingredients:** 

* Turkish coffee grounds (or VERY finely ground coffee beans, a level finer than espresso, medium roast. You can use a pestle and mortar to grind your coffee)

* Water

* Optional: Brown or white sugar

* Optional : Turkish delight (My favourite flavours are rose and pistachio, especially pistachio. I’ve linked to my favourite flavour of my favourite Turkish delight brand, Koska. Whichever brand of Turkish delight you buy, make sure it’s actually made in Turkey) 


**Directions:**


&gt;1. **One cup of Turkish coffee = one heaped teaspoon of coffee grounds.** Put a heaped, overflowing teaspoon of Turkish coffee (or just really fine coffee grounds) in the jezve, the Turkish coffee pot. Or, if you’re making two cups, you need two teaspoons of coffee, and so on. Why? If you don’t use a really heaped teaspoon of coffee, there won’t be enough concentration of oils for the crema. Make sure you use fairly fresh coffee — which means coffee grounds that haven’t been sitting around for more than a month, otherwise those oils will have dried up.



&gt;2. **‘Toast’ the coffee.** Put the coffee pot on the very smallest ring on your stovetop. If you don’t use the smallest ring, you’ll waste energy and likely cook your coffee too fast. Turn on to a low to medium heat. Why? Although you’ve only got coffee grounds in your pot, and no water yet, turning the heat on now for a few seconds helps ‘toast’ or warm the grounds, which gives off a pleasing aroma and helps develop the flavour. You can also add sugar at this step. Use one teaspoon for mildly sweet coffee, and two teaspoons (or more) for sweet coffee. I personally don’t add sugar, because I like the Turkish coffee’s bitter flavour.


&gt;3. **One cup of Turkish coffee = one espresso cup of water.** Now, you’ll add the water. The rule is one cup of water for one cup of coffee. Use your espresso cup to measure the right amount of water. Make sure to run the tap first, so you’re using fresh water. Why? Fresh water is more likely to be aerated from having just run through the faucet — so this will help your coffee have a more bubbly crema.


&gt;4. **Shallow-stir the Turkish coffee with a piece of wood.** Stir the coffee using a piece of wood. Why? Stirring with a piece of wood apparently avoids damage to the metal of the jezve. I use a kebab stick — but any piece of wood will do, like a toothpick or a chopstick. Using a thin piece of wood also stops too many of the grounds sticking to it, instead of staying in your jezve. To help the coffee grounds dissolve into the water, you’ll want to stir just the floating grounds of coffee at the top. Don’t over-stir the coffee, as this will make the bubbles disappear, meaning your coffee will be less frothy. Many people prefer to hardly stir the coffee at all — giving it only three to six stirs.


&gt;5. **Let the Turkish coffee brew.** I advise a medium low heat, so that you don’t cook the coffee too fast. However, any heat will do — but of course, the lower the heat, the longer you’ll have to wait for your delicious cup of Turkish coffee!


&gt;6. **Keep your eye on the Turkish coffee as it brews**. While a watched pot never boils, an unwatched Turkish coffee pot boils instantly. I can’t keep track of the number of times my Turkish coffee’s boiled over — and remember, if it’s reached boiling point, you’ll need to start over again.  Why? Turkish coffee needs to be heated to around 99°C, or 210°F. Any hotter, and it’ll extremely quickly lose its crema and flavour, and taste ashy. More later on temperature — and knowing when it’s ready.


&gt;7. **Slowly rotate the jezve, while tapping it with a spoon.** What’s very important not to do is deep-stir the Turkish coffee. Why? This will make all the grounds rise to the top. As you don’t filter Turkish coffee, if you stir your coffee at this stage, while it’s brewing, all the coffee sediment at the bottom will rise to the top — leading to a gritty and unpleasant mouthfeel. But what you do want to do is very gently introduce any remaining undissolved grounds to the water, which will now be hot. To do this, slowly rotate the jezve while it’s on the stovetop, and tap the outside of the jezve with a teaspoon. 10–15 taps of a teaspoon, and three to four gentle rotations of the jezve will do.


&gt;8. **As the bubbles slowly start to rise, prepare to remove the jezve from the heat.** This is the most crucial moment of your Turkish coffee brewing — wait too long, and the coffee will start to boil, which, as mentioned earlier, will ruin the flavour and crema almost instantly. If you’ve used reasonably fresh coffee that’s not been sitting around more than a month, you will see bubbles start to rise, usually around the outer edge. Often, the bubbles will not rise evenly. If you see a part of the crema that’s not so well formed, move the jezve to apply more heat to that part. This is a lot easier with a gas stove than electric or induction — but if you don’t have a gas stove, you can simply tilt the jezve towards the stove ring on the part that needs a more foamy, developed crema. Remember: stay on the side of caution. A slightly under-brewed Turkish coffee will taste far better than a burned, over-brewed one. When you see the bubbles suddenly speed up, rising up the inside of the jezve, that’s a sign you need to take the jezve off the heat, right now


&gt;9. **Pour the coffee into the espresso cup slowly, and never pour from a height.** Why? If you pour from a height, you’ll disturb your crema, and cause it to ‘dissolve’ into the coffee. Pour slowly, and in stages. The crema will likely appear on the top of you espresso cup when you’re about halfway through pouring. If you’ve made more than one cup of Turkish coffee, you’re going to want to divide the foam democratically — after all, the crema is the bit everyone wants to see! To divide the foam democratically, pour some of the coffee in the first cup, and then some in the second cup, and then repeat until you’ve poured all the coffee from the jezve to the cups.  One common technique calls for skimming the crema from the jezve with a teaspoon first, and placing that in the espresso cup, and then pouring the coffee, but this isn’t necessary if you’ve taken the time to pour the coffee alternately in each cup.


&gt;10. **Enjoy! And don’t drink down to the dregs.** In life, you don’t want to scrape the bottom of the barrel. And with Turkish coffee, never drink the bottom few millimetres. It’s where the coffee grit, or sediment, lives — and where the grit needs to stay until it’s time to wash up. Some people like to tell their fortune by looking at the grounds — but I personally prefer to spend my time making ever-better Turkish coffee. 

Now is also the time to eat that optional piece of Turkish delight, which is particularly desirable if you’ve not added sugar to your coffee — as remember, Turkish coffee is bitter!

hgklgv,I have recently discovered the absolute joy that is the moscow mule. Looking for a recipe for ginger beer.,902,99,1593221791.0,0.97,Drink,2948337,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/hgklgv/i_have_recently_discovered_the_absolute_joy_that/,"I know you asked for a recipe that is short, but if you’re making homemade ginger beer, this is the time it takes for two fermentations. It is a fun project to make that is delicious at the end. Enjoy!

I made a ginger bug last summer and found two things to be critical: 
1. Use distilled water 
2. Grate the ginger fresh just before use. 

GINGER BUG (fermentation)

Supplies: 
Dark location at 70-95 degrees F for fermentation.
Mason jar (wide mouth, pint is easiest)
Cheese cloth (or other cloth) to cover jar opening 
Ginger (1 hand, fresh)
Granulated white sugar
Distilled water

Time: 3-8 days to grow bug depending on conditions in environment.

Steps:
Start the bug by adding 2T each of sugar and ginger then mix in 1.5 cups of water. 
At the same time every day, feed your pet ginger bug using 1T each of sugar and ginger.
When you see bubbles appear, and they are easy to see, your ginger bug is ready! 

*To store the ginger bug, place it in the fridge, then feed once per week with 1T each sugar and ginger. To restart fermentation start with first step.



GINGER BEER (to drink and use, secondary fermentation)

Critical:
1. Make sure your water temp is lukewarm when you add the ginger bug.

Supplies:
Pot for boiling water
Strainer
Large vessel (&gt;4 cup) (I use a blender)
Flip-top bottles
Dark location at 70-95 degrees F for fermentation.
4 cups of distilled water
3/4 cup minced ginger
1/2 cup sugar
1 lemon, peeled
1/4 cup of ginger bug
Funnel

Time: This ginger beer can be used right away, but is best if let ferment for about 3-5 days.

Bring the 4 cups water to a boil, turn off and add the FRESH ginger, sugar and lemon peel. Stir to dissolve sugar, and wait for it to come to room temp. Strain out the ginger by pouring through cheese cloth or other strainer into a large vessel (like a blender) and add the juice of one lemon. Next strain the 1/4 cup of the ginger bug, and add the strained liquid to the “tea” in large vessel. 

Pour the mixture through a funnel into flip-top bottles. Let ferment until fully carbonated, the. Place in fridge for storage. 

*Make sure to burp the bottles every day. Do this by opening the flip-top to remove pressure. This is important and ensures your bottles don’t explode.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/hgklgv/i_have_recently_discovered_the_absolute_joy_that/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/hgklgv/i_have_recently_discovered_the_absolute_joy_that/
haq6rx,Strawberry Lemonade | Refreshing Summer Drink,87,10,1592396985.0,0.94,Drink,daredevil1302,https://imgur.com/a/WRWsrrk,"**Ingredients used:**

\----------------------------

* 8 Lemons
* 500g of Strawberries
* 9 spoons of sugar
* Zest of 5 Lemons

**Preparation:**

STEP 1 (""mixing and blending""): Clean off your lemons using hot water and salt (scrub it on the skin). Peel the lemon zest (use as many lemons as you like). Squeeze out the juice of the lemons and store it in a glass/cup/pot. Add strawberries in the blender with a bit of water to ease the blending. Sieve the blended strawberries into the lemon juice.

STEP 2 (the ""Sauce"") : Add 9 spoons of sugar, the lemon zest (the one you peeled in step 1), and a bit of water (100-200ml). Stir it over low/medium heat for 3-4 mins until sugar dissolves and the water becomes transparent. Sieve the ""sauce"" into the strawberry+lemon mix from before. Now you have the main strawberry lemonade base

STEP 3 : Pour the base into a cup/bowl of your choosing. Fill it up to the top with water. The ratio should be 60% base - 40% water.

**Butterbeer**  
*1 cup heavy whipping cream  
*1/4 cup powdered sugar  
*1/2 tsp vanilla extract  
*salt  
*1 tbsp butterscotch  
*2 tbsp salted butter

  **Instructions**   
1. Start with the creamy foam. Combine heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, a pinch of salt, and 1 tbsp of butterscotch in a mixing bowl.   
2. Whisk the cream until the mixture starts to thicken. You want to stop when it gets the viscosity of honey, not too much or it will behave like a solid.  
3. Melt 2 tbsp of butter and 4 tbsp of butterscotch together in a microwave or on the stove. Mix thoroughly. Use half of this mixture for each mug of butterbeer.  
4. Add 2 cups of cream soda to each mug, about ½ cup at a time. In between each half cup, add a tbsp of the butter and butterscotch mixture. Stir a little bit to mix it in.  
5. Add your foam to the top of the mug and enjoy!

**Frozen Butterbeer (uses same ingredients as regular)**

1. Follow the above steps to make the cream soda portion of regular butterbeer.  
2. Put the butterbeer in the freezer until it is frozen.  
3. Make the foam topping the same way as regular butterbeer.  
4. Take the butterbeer out of the freezer and put it in the blender. Pulse a few times until it has a slushy consistency. Pour into a mug and add the foam topping.

As a colonist in The Outer Worlds, you’re stuck. Stuck in your job, stuck on this planet, stuck in the capitalist hellscape that you signed yourself and your entire family up for. The pressure grows every day, the water gets blacker every minute, and even after you die, you’ll still be paying rent on your gravesite.

Let’s face it: you need a drink. And for just a few credits at the local Spacer’s Choice bar, you can get something to drown those sorrows, at least for a little while: Zero Gee Brew.

If you’ve got five minutes, there’s a full video with tons more info, including an explanation of what happens if you try to brew beer in space and why the results can be quite surprising. [Here’s the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoihtcWLZmI).

**Recipe**

* 1oz (30ml) Aperol
* 0.5oz (15ml) creme de cassis
* 0.5oz (15ml) Kahlua
* 1 bottle Hop Zombie (or another high-strength IPA)

Add all ingredients to a beer stein. Garnish with a lemon wheel with a top hat. Obviously. Serve!

**Tasting notes:** Fruity and juicy with enough bitterness to avoid being one-dimensional.

**Best paired with:** Cranberry-chicken pizza and unfettered capitalism.

If you’ve got 5 minutes, there’s a[ video recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB9hTQ7LPww) too that shows off that nuclear luminescence and explains how you can get the same effect in other drinks. It's surprisingly easy.

**Recipe**

* 2oz bourbon (from the razorgrain and corn in the in-game recipe)
* .75oz blue curacao (to get that blue colour)
* .50oz peach liqueur (Nuka Cola is apparently fruity, not just a Coca Cola analog)
* .50oz lemon juice (to knock back the sweetness)
* Tonic water (for nuclear reasons)
* A blacklight (optional)

Add all the ingredients to a moonshine jug, making sure they’re chilled. Add a straw. Shine a blacklight on it. Admire what you have created. Serve!

In Guns, Love and Tentacles, I noticed a few colourful drinks with especially unpleasant names on the shot menu at The Lodge . I decided to recreate them, starting with the grossest sounding of the lot: ‘Corpsegrinder’.

Hope you enjoy! Hit me up with questions in the comments and let me know which of the other shots you’d like to see IRL.

**Recipe**

* 20ml tequila blanco
* 10ml blue curacao
* 30ml fresh unfiltered tangelo juice (or orange juice if that’s easier to get)
* 5ml lime juice

Add the tangelo and lime juice to a shot glass. Make sure the pulp is still in. Mix the tequila blanco and blue curacao together and carefully layer over the back of a spoon on top of the lime/tangelo mix. Serve!

**What’s that gross looking stuff at the bottom?** That’s the tangelo pulp. For a drink called Corpsegrinder, it felt right to have something with a bit of texture in there. Feel free to filter it out if that isn’t your bag - it’ll taste the same.

**What does it taste like?** Sweet, citrusy, bright but not super strong. Be ready to make a few if you want to get on it like a bonnet*.*

**Why do you need to mix the tequila and blue curacao together first?** Blue curacao is super sweet and dense, so it usually sinks to the bottom of a drink. But tequila is the opposite. Mix them together and their density evens out, making the mixture float on top of something like tangelo or orange juice.

As a long-time fan of the game, I thought it was about time I recreated something from Dwarf Fortress---and in a title where a lack of alcohol quickly turns into a lack of fortress, what better to recreate than the most valuable booze in the game: Sunshine.

If you’ve got a spare five minutes, I highly recommend taking a look through [the full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHxpjr1_Al0). There’s heaps more information on how to make sunberry syrup (did you know sunberries are a real life berry? But I didn’t use them for a good reason...) and the inspiration behind the drink.

Hope you enjoy! Hit me up with questions in the comments.

**Recipe**

* 2oz (60ml) brandy
* 0.75oz (20ml) ‘sunberry syrup’
* 1 egg yolk
* Chocolate bitters

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly to chill. Discard the ice. Shake again, hard. Strain into your chosen vessel. Serve!

**Tasting notes:** Thick, rich, luxurious - exactly what you’d expect an expensive alcohol to taste like.

**Best paired with:** More Sunshine.

Start by making a hole in the coconut and take the water out in a bowl.

With the help of a spoon or a scooper, start removing the tender coconut from inside the coconut shell. To get a tender coconut, you will need to talk to the seller about which coconut will be soft on the inside.

__Directions__

In a blender, you will need to add the coconut water, the coconut pulp, and the sugar.

Keep blending until the coconut has fully blended in with the coconut water. Since the coconut will be soft, it will not take too much time.

Pour the coconut juice into a town and leave it in the freezer for at least 10 minutes. When the juice is being served cold, it will taste the best.

New Zealand went into a COVID-19 lockdown this week, so I decided it was time to recreate a drink from the biggest proponents of #stayinside in the history of mankind: the citizens of the Novosibirsk Metro, frantically panic-buying every last vial of Green Stuff they can find.

Think coronavirus is bad? Try nuclear fallout. Beyond the sealed doors and locked gates of Metro, it’s nothing but a frozen wasteland for miles around, filled with mutants and demons and strange phenomena - and that’s without even mentioning the radiation that sets every geiger counter crackling. And there’s still no spare toilet paper.

Every adventurer exiting the Metro needs three things: a hazmat suit, a brass set of balls and, in the case of Novosibirsk survivors, as much Radioprotector AKA ‘Green Stuff’ they can carry.

* 1oz (30ml) vodka
* 1.5oz (45ml) Midori
* .50oz (15ml) lemon juice
* Tbsp pastis

Add the pastis to your vessel and swirl it around as a rinse. Discard the majority. Add your vodka, Midori and lemon juice to a shaker filled with ice and shake thoroughly. Strain into your vessel. Garnish with a syringe and a lemon wheel. Serve!

**Tasting notes:** A Midori sour with a heavy sweetness tempered by the slight twinge of anise from the pastis.

Almost all of the major brands in the US, from the high-end to the low-end, are made in the same bottling factories from pure industrial ethanol delivered in rail tanker cars at 95% concentration. In the US, regulations prohibit adulteration of that ethanol if it is being labeled as ""vodka"" so it can't actually taste different -- that is all in your head. I've actually been inside the bottling plants in the US and observed it first-hand, but it works that way in the rest of the world too. Vodka is a very simple product with a very simple supply chain, created from a fungible global commodity. 

tl;dr: Kirkland vodka is identical to every other brand they sell. In many cases, literally from the same vat of industrial ethanol. Differences between vodka brands are almost purely branding and marketing, not liquid product\*. 

\*There are a few bespoke distilleries that use low-efficiency distillation that may leave impurities in that you can taste.

The wastelands of the Fallout franchise would be a lot dumber without Mentats: those little red brain-boosting pills that can make even a supermutant at least as smart as Dogmeat---if only temporarily. 

The cocktail version, then, is 50% libation, 50% science experiment, designed to show off just how much you paid attention in middle school chemistry. It combines whiskey-spiked sparkling wine with baking soda to create an explosively fizzing drink that’s almost as fun to watch as it is to drink.

I *highly* recommend watching the [full video](https://youtu.be/9-v0izL709U) for this one to see the full fizzing reaction. [Here’s the timestamp](https://youtu.be/9-v0izL709U?t=180) if you want to get to the good bit. There’s also heaps more info throughout on the inspo, so check it out if you’re a curious Fallout fan.

**Recipe**

**For the cocktail:**

* 1 oz (30ml) Famous Grouse scotch
* 0.5 (15ml) elderflower liqueur
* Sparkling wine

**For the Mentat:**

* 1 altoid-style mint
* Peychaud’s Bitters
* Red food dye
* Baking soda

Add the mint to a small glass and cover with bitters and red food dye. Leave for 10 minutes. Strain and dip into baking soda, leave for another 10 minutes. *Thoroughly* shake off excess baking soda and place into a champagne flute. Emphasis on thoroughly - you’ll end up with a soda-y cocktail otherwise.

Add the sparkling white wine, leaving some room at the top. Enjoy the fizz! Add the Famous Grouse and elderflower liqueur. Garnish with a lemon peel. Serve!

**Tasting notes:** Refreshingly minty with a floral start and a long malty finish.

**Best paired with:** A nuclear sunset.

Add the first three ingredients to a Collins glass filled with ice, approximately half and half on the beer and tea. Thrust in the slice of crispy bacon and add a straw. Consider all the life choices that led you to this point. Serve!

**INGREDIENTS**

**+** 45g (1/4 cup) dark or regular brown sugar

**+** 60g (4 tbps) water

**+** 90g (2/3) tapioca starch

**DIRECTIONS**

1. Pour water and brown sugar into a pot and boil mixture on medium to high heat.
2. Stir continuously so the sugar does not burn. Once the mixture is dissolved and bubbles form, take the pot off the heat.
3. Add one tablespoon of the tapioca starch and mix until combined. (*You can use a spatula or wooden spoon*)
4. Place pot back on low to medium heat and stir continuously. When the mixture starts to bubble, place pot off heat and stir till it has a sticky consistency *(kind of like slime)*.
5. Add the remaining tapioca starch and mix softly. *(You want to be gentle to the dough when mixing the starch so that it doesn’t dry out)*
6. Once the dough is warm enough to work with, place the dough onto a flat surface and knead so all of the starch is combined *(At first, the dough is not going to look smooth and that’s okay! Also, don’t be rough when kneading)*
7. Roll the dough so that it forms a log (approx. 4 inches thick) and divide the dough into twelve equal pieces. *(I used a dough scraper for this, but you can use a knife)*
8. Roll out each piece long so that it reaches around 1/2 inch thickness. *(Dust your hands with tapioca starch and be gentle with the dough when rolling).*
9. Align the twelve long pieces together and cut the dough into smaller pieces *(1/2 inches lengthwise).*
10. Dust your hands with tapioca starch and gently roll the small pieces until a ball is formed. Place the balls in a bowl of tapioca starch. Once balls are rolled, sift out the excess starch from the bowl. **DONE!** You just made your own boba pearls. :)

**STORAGE**

Leave them in an airtight container in room temperature

**PREPARATION**

1. Heat a pot of water on high heat and pour the pearls into the pot. Once the pearls are floating to the surface of boiling water, reduce heat to medium heat and stir constantly for 20 minutes.
2. After 20 minutes, place pot off heat, cover and leave for 20 minutes.
3. Pour the water through a sieve and run the peals over cold, icy water.
4. In a small pot, heat 70g (1/2 cup) of brown sugar and 2tbsp water over medium heat until mixture dissolves and slightly bubbles.
5. Add the pearls in the pot with sugar and gently stir.
6. Pour some of the pearl mixture into a drinking glass so it fills 1/4.
7. **ENJOY** by pouring warm milk! (There’s unlimited possibilities on how you want to enjoy your drink. I made myself warm earl grey milk tea with boba. You can use cold or warm milk)

*NOTE : I apologise that the recipe is long af. But if you have the time to make homemade boba pearls, it is really worth it and tastes sooo much better than your usual milk tea shop. It wasn’t that difficult, it’s just time consuming. Good luck!

Please direct all cruel observations to the comments of [the main video](https://youtu.be/CzRaWC3X04k) to make sure you really hurt my feelings. I am a fragile flower.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I remixed a recipe direct from the developers into something a little more lore-friendly: Bloodwort from Remnant: From The Ashes.

**Recipe**

* 2oz (60ml) bourbon
* 0.5oz (15ml) cranberry juice
* 0.5oz (15ml) amaretto
* 0.5oz (15ml) Campari

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly to chill. Strain into your chosen vessel. Serve!

**Background**

It's not often that video games have official cocktail recipes: I'd be out of a niche if there were. Remnant is the exception, the developers having released not one but several recipes for much-used items including Divine Nectar, Oilskin Flask and, most iconic of all, Bloodwort.

I gave their version a try, and it was good - but I thought it could be better. First, the official recipe didn't feature those “red leaves” that Bloodwort in-game is supposedly made from. Second, it was a little off-base for flavour balance - too sweet. So I made my own version that keeps to most of the original recipe, but has its own twist to make it better match the lore and the palette.

I toned back the cranberry and the amaretto, but the biggest change is the addition of Campari. Initially, I wanted to use Blutworz, a bitter German apertif that’s red and literally made from ‘bloodroot’. Unfortunately, it's very hard to get a hold of outside of Germany. Campari a) is easier to get, b) transfers a lovely red hue and c) gives it that bitter flavour that you'd expect of something medicinal. Plus, it being an amaro, I suspect there are some leaves (red or otherwise) used as one of its many infused botanicals. It’s the closest we can get to lore-friendly without buying a plane ticket.

You're left with a complex drink that has more mature flavours rather than pure nut and fruit and sweetness. Both recipes are nice in their own way, but I think you can guess which I prefer to have on me when fighting the Root.

Cheers!

**Tasting notes:** Bitter, savoury and medicinal.

**Best paired with:** Dragonheart cold cuts.

Add the mint leaves and whiskey to your vessel and muddle thoroughly. Fill the rest of the vessel with cracked ice. Pour the peach syrup over the top. Garnish with a sprig of mint and a straw. Serve!

**Background**

In The Long Dark, resource management is key. You can't lug around every tool, every piece of clothing, every crumb of food and drop of drink you find without incurring serious penalties. You have to be very choosey with what you bring out into the snow.

Pinnacle Peaches gets a bad rap as a result. Canned peaches are heavy, it doesn't restore too many calories, and you need a can opener to open it without spillage---a tool rarer than you might expect in the quiet apocalypse. Sure, it restores thirst as well as hunger and, if you can heat it up, it buffers you against the cold, but that doesn't mean much when you have the choice between it and a hatchet.

So when I decided to make a drink inspired by what is one of my most favourite games *ever*, I knew I wanted to revamp this maligned item. And how better to make new friends than with a generous helping of booze?

Muddle some mint, add some whiskey and some crushed ice, and you get a Kentucky-born, Canadian-perfected version of a mint julep that even the most desperate survivor could mix in a pinch. Hope you enjoy!

**Tasting notes:** Chillingly cold but also coldingly chill. Fruitsweet and refreshing with a light rye finish.

**Best paired with:** Wolf meat, charred and crispy.

ey1yln,Ambrosia cocktail (from Enderal: Lost Stories),12,2,1580706916.0,0.85,Drink,RAD_or_shite,https://i.redd.it/ga67mv4o7ne41.png," 

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I took on a drink from perhaps the most expansive Skyrim mod of all time: Ambrosia, from Enderal: Lost Stories.

**Recipe**

* 2oz (60ml) London Dry gin
* 0.75oz (20ml) split gomme syrup
* 0.50oz (15ml) lemon juice
* 0.50oz (15ml) yellow Chartreuse
* 2 drops saline solution

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice and shake thoroughly. Strain into your chosen vessel. Garnish with a lemon wheel. Serve!

**Background**

Enderal may be a Skyrim mod but it might as well be an entirely different game. Far more difficult, far more punishing and far more complicated, it scratches that oldschool-RPG itch that Skyrim could never quite reach - even with a loofa.

The way that potions work is just one of the changes Enderal makes. In Skyrim, you can chug potions until your belly is swollen and you're one dragon shout away from spewing all over the enemy. Not so in Enderal, where drinking too many potions will result in you suffering a fatal dose of Arcane Fever - and it can only be counteracted by Ambrosia: a temporary and devilishly expensive fix.

This real life version is, I hope, a little more accessible. It’s based on the only description of the potion I could find: “Undead sweat”, according to Jespar Dal’Verak. Gomme syrup for thiccness, Chartreuse for embalming herbs, and some saline solution for… well. Sweat.

Ambrosia: it's good for what ails you - if what ails you is transforming into a feral monstrosity. No adventure is complete without drinking at least 3. Cheers!

**Tasting notes:** Thick, lemony and refreshing with a little herbal tickle and a salty finish.

**Best paired with:** A nice crisp piece of meat.

eu3oyu,Strawberry Surprise cocktail (from Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead),21,4,1580023205.0,0.87,Drink,RAD_or_shite,https://i.redd.it/pb3pru1nq2d41.png,"More of a ""watching"" kind of person or want more info? [The full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJtDnZgY748) has your answer.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I recreated a recipe for disaster back into one for survival with a tweaked version of Strawberry Surprise from Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.

**Recipe**

* 2 oz vodka
* 2 strawberries
* 0.50 oz lemon juice
* 0.75 oz simple syrup
* 2 dashes fish sauce

Add the vodka and strawberries to a mixing glass. Muddle thoroughly to infuse.

Strain it into a shaker filled with ice.

Add the lemon juice, simple syrup and fish sauce.

Shake thoroughly and strain into your chosen vessel.

Serve!

**Background**

If you can get over the simple graphics, Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is any survival fan’s dream. It’s constantly being updated with new features and, best of all, it’s completely free. Highly customisable, infinitely replayable, devilishly in-depth with crafting recipes for everything from clean water to laser rifles. 

But perhaps one of the most useful recipes is the cutely named Strawberry Surprise; a simple alcoholic drink that combines strawberries, vodka and heat to create an early-game way to get drunk, get hydrated and preserve food all at the same time.

And I hate it.

The in-game Strawberry Surprise doesn’t make any sense. Strawberries and vodka, heated in a pot, and somehow that’s tasty? I tried making the in-game recipe (view the results in the video linked above) and it tastes like boiled vodka with a tiny spittle of strawberry. Yuck.

Instead, I came up with my own version that retains the strawberries and vodka but adds an actual surprise: fish sauce. The salty savouriness makes it distinct from a regular vodka-strawberry sour and brings out the sweetness, but without it going overboard into purely piscine territory.

Sure to keep up your morale while you fight away yet another horde of zombies. Cheers!

**Tasting notes:** Sweet, bright, refreshing with a little salty savoury.

**Best paired with:** Wastebread topped with hard cheese and rehydrated fruit.

eqqz39,Wyldsap cocktail from Armello,16,2,1579403547.0,0.83,Drink,RAD_or_shite,https://imgur.com/drvfOmL,"I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I combined maple syrup, pine nuts, bourbon and Angostura to create a healing draft for the faithful: Wyldsap.


**Recipe**

- 2 oz bourbon (I used Wild Turkey)
- 0.5 oz maple syrup &amp; pine nut orgeat (see below)
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters

Add all ingredients to a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir thoroughly to chill. Strain into your vessel. Garnish with greenery. Serve!

**Maple-pine orgeat**

Add half a cup of pine nuts to a frying pan. Gently heat until the pine nuts are brown and toasted. You’ll smell it once they’re done!

In a small saucepan, combine half a cup of maple syrup and half a cup of water. Heat gently to combine. Do not boil. 

Add the toasted pine nuts to the maple-water mixture and heat gently for 10 to 20 minutes. Taste regularly. Once nutty, strain the mixture into a heatproof bowl and allow to cool in the fridge, preferably overnight. Then use in this recipe.

**Background**

Armello is full of curious, magical things. Swords, shields, armour and magical staves, weapons designed to fight other players, guards, and eventually the King himself. But the thing that might truly save your character in this wolf-eat-wolf world is Wyldsap: a bubbling amber healing liquid that will restore you in a pinch or draw on the strength of the Wyld in a tough fight.

In recreating Wyldsap, I went back to Armello’s roots: literally. The drink is described as being drawn from great, old trees, which immediately makes me think of maple syrup. Combined with a touch of mild nuttiness from the pine nuts, some savoury from the Angostura and a broadbacked bourbon to carry it all, it ends up being a sweet (but not too sweet) cocktail that you can’t help but feel healed after.

Enjoy it in moderation, however, lest the Rot decide to take an interest in you. Cheers!

endtka,Source cocktail from Divinity Original Sin,63,1,1578779142.0,0.86,Drink,RAD_or_shite,https://i.redd.it/vc2sdo7ez7a41.png," 

Prefer to listen rather than read? Check out [the original video](https://youtu.be/xRloKgNjGFs).

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I summoned my inner divine and created a simple drink with a lot of power: Source, from Divinity Original Sin 2.

**Recipe**

* 0.25 oz (10ml) blue curacao
* 0.25 oz (10ml) Midori
* 0.25 oz (10ml) Jagermeister
* Energy drink

Add the Midori, blue curacao and energy drink to a shot glass. Leave a little room at the top. Carefully layer the Jagermeister over the top. Serve!

**Background**

Source: divine power in a bluish-greenish-blackish bubbling liquid package. Slurp up this God-juice and you can summon flesh-eating corpse flowers, rain down meteors or… [throw a bunch of knives all at once](https://divinityoriginalsin2.wiki.fextralife.com/Fan+of+Knives)? Look, not every source power is a show-off.

In recreating Source, I wanted to do two things: make it look the part and make it taste the part. I tried all sorts of drinks: tall, short, strong, weak, sweet and bitter and sour and all of them combined. I ended up settling on the humble shooter because a) they’re fun, 2) it lends itself to a cool black-into-teal layering effect just like Source in-game and iv) it makes for a great multiplayer DOS2 drinking game: get a source point, make a Source. Use it up, drink it down. Repeat ad nauseam. Or ad divinitas? My Latin is rusty, feel free to correct.

**Tasting notes:** Sweet, a bit herby from the Jager, super fruity and very more-ish.

**Best paired with:** Crispy voidtainted fish w/ garlic butter

If you want something to bookmark, [here’s the written article.](https://experience-bar.com/butterlords-brew-mount-blade/)

**Recipe**

* 2oz rum
* 2 tbsp rum batter (see below)
* Hot water

Add the rum and batter to your vessel. Top with hot water. Stir with a cinnamon stick and serve.

**How to make the batter**

Add 1 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar to a saucepan. Heat gently and mix until combined. Slowly add 2 cups double cream, stirring briskly until combined. Add a tablespoon of cinnamon and a tablespoon of nutmeg. Stir and remove from heat. Allow to cool. Chill or freeze.

This will make enough for a fair number of servings so be ready to share with friends.

**Background**

""After consulting with the peers of the realm, King Harlaus has decided to confer every fief in the kingdom on King Harlaus.""

King Harlaus happily feasts while war rages all around him. There's only one thing that will get him to stop choking down turkey legs and swilling red wine: when his butter vats are empty. Time to refill them with an appropriately named brew.

Here’s the breakdown for those /r/outoftheloop: in Mount &amp; Blade, Harlaus is the king of Swadia. Swadia is in the middle of the map, so it gets attacked - a lot. This makes Harlaus' vassals a n g e r y, so he throws a lot of feasts to raise morale. He will even throw a feast *in a place that is under siege.* Combine that with the fact that Swadian villages are often filled with butter (courtesy of a certain popular modpack), and suddenly King Harlaus has a new title: Butterlord. 

So I've made a drink that would fit perfectly at his groaning feasting table, featuring that most precious yellow substance right at its rapidly clogging heart: Butterlord’s Brew, which has become my favourite Hot Buttered Rum recipe.

It's rich, it's spicy, it's damnably simple to make, and best of all, it's incredibly bad for you. Cocktails in general do not have a reputation for being healthy, but this drink could clog the arteries of a blue whale. But the whale would die happy because it's fucking delicious.

The recipe will make enough batter for a full feast. Give it a try, and if you like what you taste, make sure to share it around all your vassals. It's a tonic for instant loyalty. Or, for full Harlaus LARP, just confer it solely on yourself. Cheers!

Got a question the gif doesn’t answer? The [full video](https://youtu.be/7zQTwYWR_VM) probably doesn’t either but it’s entertaining at least.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). If you’ve ever wanted to get those damn splicers off your lawn, Murder of Crows is the vigor for you. It’s formulated from only the most freshly squeezed ADAM-infused sea slugs and no self-respecting Zealot of the Lady would be found without a bottle.

**Recipe**

* 2 oz bourbon
* 0.75 oz sarsaparilla reduction
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters

To make the sarsaparilla reduction, add half a cup of brown sugar and a tablespoon of cuttlefish ink to half a cup of your favourite sarsaparilla. Heat gently until combined. Once the sugar has dissolved, remove from the heat and allow to cool.

To make the cocktail, add all ingredients to a mixing glasses with ice. Stir thoroughly to chill. Strain into your vessel. Garnish with a feather. Serve!

**Background**

Murder of Crows, one of my favourite vigors from Bioshock Infinite, is equal parts horrifying and entertaining. Point your finger at an offending soul and they’ll soon find themselves without their most valued soft wobbly parts as a tornado of crows tear them off. It also earns the trophy of being the most interesting vigor visually, which pushes it to the top of my list to cocktail-ify.

Columbia is so enraptured with the idea of American supremacy that it blinds itself with racism and xenophobia. Any drink, then, that comes from a city obsessed with the 'American spirit' should have an equally American spirit as a base. Bourbon. 2 ounces.

Next, we have the sweetener, a reduction of sarsaparilla mixed with sugar and a [dab of squid/cuttlefish ink](https://youtu.be/a7PqyopzNPo). The ink gives it that dark colour and is a nod towards the sea-slug-based ADAM in the drink that allows for the crow powers. But why sarsaparilla? The [advertising for the Murder of Crows](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bioshock/images/0/02/Murder_of_Crows_Advert.png/revision/latest?cb=20140619043416) in the game is based heavily upon real-life advertising. In fact, it’s almost a carbon copy of a[ sarsaparilla advert from the 19th century](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bioshock/images/2/21/Ayer%27s_Sarsaparilla_Ad.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20150406064743). So, of course, we have to use sarsaparilla as a key ingredient.

Lastly, we have the Angostura bitters. Cocktail buffs will now recognise this drink as a variation on an Old Fashioned: a proto-cocktail that has stood the test of time. The bitters adds a more savoury note to the cocktail, and backs up the American roots of this drink with a nod to a cocktail that wouldn’t be out of place in a saloon.

All up, the Murder of Crows adds a herbal and licorice note to a standardOld-Fashioned recipe. Certainly recognisable as a classic, but with a twist that makes it stand out among its cousins - much like Bioshock: Infinite itself. Cheers!

“This is such a nightmare of a drink… look at this...” - [The full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rzy5L7aNIXc)

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I’m showing you the only drink worth fighting a civil war over: The White-Gold Tower from Skyrim.

**Recipe**

* .50 oz cream
* 1 oz honey liqueur
* .50 oz honey lavender simple syrup
* 3 oz dry honey wine

Chill and add the liqueur, simple syrup and mead to your vessel, leaving a small amount of room at the top of the glass. Layer your cream over the back of a spoon and garnish with culinary lavender. Serve!

**Background**

Step into the Bee &amp; Barb in Riften, Skyrim, and you’ll be presented with what seems like your average Nord tavern. But this one is a little different - and I’m not (just) talking about the fact that it’s an Argonian behind the bar. It’s more about what that Argonian offers you to drink.

See, Talen-Jei is the only bartender in all of Tamriel that knows how to make a cocktail. And he even spells out exactly what goes into each of his three creations as a part of his pitch to the player. Perfect for ~~plagiarism~~ translation into the real world.

The White-Gold Tower is the most simple of his three drinks, consisting of blended meads, cream and lavender. But don’t let the recipe fool you: this is a surprisingly deep and complex cocktail that requires a seriously steady hand to make when it comes to the layer - likely the most iconic part of this drink. 

Mess up the layer, and you might end up with a glass full of curdles. Succeed, and you’ve crafted a sweet, creamy, rich and extremely tasty after-dinner cocktail that opens up with a burst of floral lavender, moves through mead sweetness and ends with a raw woodsy honey note. Just make sure you don’t have more than a couple, else you might end up signing some kind of concordat.

Hope you enjoy! And if you like this, you might also be a fan of my take on Talen-Jei’s other drinks: the [Cliff Racer](https://youtu.be/Y5im1L7qL6o) (now with less screeching) and the [Velvet LeChance](https://youtu.be/yG3oiN-g9Eg) (spicy, dear brother).

At first glance, the recipe for Concentrated Distillate (which can be found on the blackboard in a secret lab in Roseway Gardens) seems standard enough. Apple juice, apple cider, flavoured vodka, some spices… and then you hit the 750ml bottle of laboratory-grade alcohol. 

I love it when a game spells out a cocktail recipe word for word. I love it a lot less when that recipe calls for 95% ethanol. You can’t buy that where I live. So when a fan asked me to recreate this recipe, I had to distill it myself - something that is, fun fact, legal to do here in Aotearoa.

It was a hell of a lot of work for just one recipe. And honestly? I was worried it wouldn’t be worth it. How good could a random recipe scrawled on an in-game blackboard really be in real life?

Turns out, my lack of faith wasn’t warranted. Concentrated Distillate, after I scaled it down to a more reasonable 2 to 3 person serving, is pretty damn good. It’s far too sweet and it doesn’t really need the extra sugar, but other than that? Tastes like a spiced apple punch that has the added bonus of kicking like a mule. Perfect for springing on your friends or family this Christmas.

Overall, this was definitely a fun experiment, and I wish more games made my attempts to recreate drinks from games simultaneously so much easier and so much harder. Bonus tip: if you can’t find whipped cream vodka, use vanilla vodka instead - and you can absolutely substitute the high-proof stuff for standard 80 proof/40% vodka. Your liver will thank you.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I’m showing you how to make a drink to be shared only during jolly cooperation: Siegbrau from Dark Souls.

**Recipe**

* 1 bottle (500ml) of Bock or Doppelbock beer
* 1 orange, sliced
* 0.5 tsp grated ginger
* 2 oz (60ml) honey
* 2 cloves
* 1/2 cinnamon stick
* Pinch of nutmeg
* Dark rum

Add all ingredients except the dark rum to a saucepan. Heat gently until warmed and leave to simmer for at least 20 minutes. Just before serving, add 0.5oz (15ml) of dark rum to a glass and top with the heated beer mixture. Garnish (if you can be bothered) with an orange and a pickled onion. Serve!

**Background**

When the slightest misstep loses hours of progress, you’re more likely to have a permanent frown of concentration than a grin of happiness when playing Dark Souls. But even in a world like this, there are some things that can only be described as G R O S S L Y I N C A N D E S C E N T. Siegmeyer of Catarina, the Big Onion Boye himself, is one such bright spark. 

Recreating his drink, Siegbrau, or (“Victory Brew” in German), was a challenge. It’s never stated what it is, only that even an Undead can enjoy it. We can assume it would be analogous to some kind of German beer, considering its name and the tankard in which it’s served. But that’s not the end of the story: Siegbrau can’t just be any old beer. It has to be able to warm the bones of the undead themselves.

After delving into the incredibly complex world of German beer, I came out triumphantly holding aloft a very special recipe for something I think fits the bill: gluhbier. If you’ve had gluhwein before, this is the beer equivalent: a spiced, warmed, mulled drink that’s usually enjoyed around Christmas-time. If the idea of warm beer makes you shiver and shake, this is the time to turn back – but I hope you’ll give it a try, because it is surprisingly good.

The key to making a good Siegbrau, however, isn’t in the ingredients. It’s in the sharing. Ensure that you make a big batch of this stuff and share it around the grossly incandescent people in your life. It’s the way Siegmeyer intended it to be enjoyed; restoring humanity one sip at a time. Cheers!

The [full video is way better](https://youtu.be/hXKQ5Q8MTd8), just FYI.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I’m slapping down a crafting table and a cauldron and showing you how to create a Potion of Healing from Minecraft.

**Recipe**

* 2 oz pink gin or pink vodka (I used 1919 or Blush)
* .25 oz (10ml) honey liqueur
* .50 oz (15ml) watermelon simple syrup
* .50 oz (15ml) lemon juice

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly to chill. Strain into your preferred vessel. Garnish with a lemon peel. Serve!

**Background**

Want to feel absolutely ancient? It’s been nearly 10 years since the first playable beta of Minecraft was released. There have been a lot of updates over the years, but one always stands out for me: the alchemy update. I hadn’t played for ages, and then suddenly I was diving back into the Nether to harvest Nether Wart and cracking entire mountains to get at gold and iron enough for the multitude of new ingredients for the mystical Minecraft potions.

In this real life take on a Potion of Healing, we’ve created our own Glistering Melon with watermelon simple syrup and golden honey liqueur - and in fact, the honey liqueur I used in this had gold flakes in it too. But you don’t have to be so extra. 

Throw in a pink liquor of your choice creates a bright, fresh and very summer-y drink that certainly feels like it’s knitting your wounds together. Oh and if you want some of that bright bright red? Just flick some grenadine in. It won’t affect the flavour too much.

Hope you enjoy! And if you like this, you might also be a fan of my take on the [Potion of Healing from Dungeons &amp; Dragons](https://youtu.be/ON7hWfnW5Ls).

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I’m showing you how to survive and thrive in the cordyceps apocalypse with a simple, shroomy take on an Old Fashioned inspired by The Last of Us.

**Recipe**

* 2oz (60ml) smoky whisky (I like to use Ardbeg or Laphroiag)
* .5oz (15ml) maple-mushroom syrup
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters

Add all ingredients to a mixing glass with some with ice. Stir thoroughly until chilled. Strain into your chosen vessel. Garnish with a dried mushroom, thyme and orange peel. Serve!

To make the maple-mushroom simple syrup, leave some dried shitaake mushroom in a mixture of 50/50 maple syrup and water for at least an hour. Taste for flavour. Not shroomy enough? Leave it for another hour and taste again. Repeat until the desired flavour is achieved.

**Background**

If you’ve ever wanted to know the most likely zombie apocalypse, The Last of Us has your answer. It’s mushrooms. Rabid, parasitic mushrooms. Why is it the most probable? Because they already exist.

As ants.

See, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, or just “cordyceps” in the game,is real. It preys on ants in tropical places like Brazil. But rather than becoming super-violent monstrosities, infected ants just clamp themselves to a nearby plant. This allows the fungus to grow, pop out of the ant’s head, and rain spores down on their former colony.

Less classic Romero zombie and more just “that’s freaky”, but still enough to make you wonder what might happen if this real life fungal parasite managed to make the leap to humanity. Is The Last Of Us far from the truth?

To ease back the nightmares of getting chomped by a shroomhead, I created the Clicker. It’s a simple drink, basically a riff on an Old Fashioned, but the mushroom infusion adds a unique earthiness. Paired up with the maple syrup and the natural smokiness of the whisky to create a savoury bomb of flavour, a Clicker cocktail is a lot more inviting than the creature after which it’s named. Just make sure you don’t accidentally infuse it with actual cordyceps. That… might end badly.

Hope you enjoy! And if you’re looking for a different kind of post-apocalypse, you might like my take on the [Sierra Madre Martini from Fallout: New Vegas](https://youtu.be/VgFuvzwI6gE).

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I’m showing you a drink that’s as good as gold: the Sierra Madre Martini, from Fallout: New Vegas, Dead Money.

**Recipe**

* 2.5 oz (75ml) tequila anejo
* .5 oz (15ml) red vermouth
* 2 dashes chocolate bitters

Add all ingredients to a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir thoroughly to chill. Strain into your vessel. Serve!

**Background**

My take on a real life Sierra Madre Martini is an attempt at a faithful recreation of the spirit of the original in-game drink, but with a fair few tweaks to the original recipe to make it actually enjoyable. It's smoky, it's strong, it's a little bit sweet---quite a departure from the traditional gin martini, but just as easy to raise in toast to another successful gold heist.

Honestly, this one has an enormous amount of background to it that I won’t go into here, including research into martini ratios from the 1950s, how to integrate the in-game potato chips into the recipe, and a whole bunch of other game/historical stuff.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I’m showing you a drink I like to call “alternatively historically accurate” (we’re workshopping the name I swear): the Great Frost from Frostpunk.

**Recipe**

* 1 gill (4 oz) vodka
* 1/2 gill (2 oz) maraschino liqueur
* Shaved ice
* Mint sprigs, muddled
* 2 dashes orange bitters

Add the mint leaves and vodka to a mixing glass. Muddle gently until aromatic. Strain the vodka into a separate vessel and discard the mint leaves. Add the maraschino liqueur and bitters to the vodka. Add ice (not the crushed ones). Stir thoroughly. Pack a short glass with shaved ice and add your alcohol mixture. Serve!

**Background**

I love stories about alternate histories. What if Germany had won World War 2? What if humanity had never discovered gunpowder? What if the Dark Ages had never happened? What would the world look like?

The snow-covered world you crunch through in Frostpunk is a unique take on this “what if”. Holocausts brought about by sudden, irreversible climate change aren't a new idea (especially considering our current environmental woes). But combining that apocalypse with steampunk tech and a soul-crushingly nihilistic winter backdrop? That wins points in originality.

So to create a drink as original as Frostpunk itself, I returned to the time from which its timeline departed from our own: the 19th century. In the 1872 mixology guide [Cooling Cups and Dainty Drinks](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1872-Cooling-Cups-and-Dainty-Drinks-Mixellany), I found the recipe for a classic cocktail that fit the bill: a Gin Julep. Forget images of derbies and bourbon, this is a different beast. It features copious amounts of gin (measured in ""gills""), maraschino, mint and plenty of ice. A frosty drink for a frosty game.

However, while gin might be appropriate for a game mostly set in the UK, it didn't feel right for Frostpunk. Moonshine cooked up around sputtering fires by the few survivors of The Great Frost shouldn't be so refined as gin. Instead, we substitute vodka for a cleaner, more alternative-historically accurate drink and slap in a couple of dashes of orange bitters… because it just tastes better that way.

Pour this over over cold, cold ice to accentuate the cooling nature of the mint, you end up with a fresh, bright, cherry-and-orange infused drink that might help keep the cold outside at bay---as long as the coal stores last.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I’m showing you how to beat the heat and score some new crafting materials with this mint-and-rum cocktail that'll send a shiver down your spine.

**Recipe**

* 1.5 oz (45ml) white rum
* 1 oz (30ml) pineapple rum
* .25 oz (15ml) blue curacao
* 8-10 mint leaves
* 2 dashes orange bitters

Add the mint leaves and white rum to a mixing glass. Muddle by pressing gently with a flat tool. Strain into a shaker filled with ice. Discard mint leaves. Add the rest of the ingredients. Shake thoroughly to chill. Strain into your chosen vessel. Garnish with mint and serve!

**Background**

In a world full of games that are primarily about getting stuck into the action as fast as possible, Horizon: Zero Dawn breaks the mold with tactical take on combat. Rushing in an going toe-to-toe with an enormous robotic tiger creature is certainly fun, but there's something very special about springing a Rube Goldberg machine of traps to shatter it from the shadows instead.

Freeze bombs are just part of your strategic arsenal and easily one of my favourite ways of picking a fight. Lock the enemy down *and* do extra damage when you switch to the deadlier weapons? Sends a shiver down my spine, every time.

For a drinkable version of the Freeze Bomb, using mint and blue curacao was an easy choice: how else are you going to get a chilly flavour with a frosty colour? But we don't stop there, throwing in a mix of tropical flavours with our rums and rounding out the drink with some bitters at the end. A fresh, fruity cocktail that would be perfect for a day by the pool.

## Ingredients

### Brew Your Own Tea option:

3 tbsp of dried black tea leaves (or 3 tea bags)

500 mL boiling water

3 tbsp of milk powder (malted milk powder is even better if you have it)

15 drops of liquid sweetener, or to taste

Toppings like grass jelly, tapioca pearls (optional)

### Pre-Mixed Powder option:

80 g milk tea powder (I use Greenmax Black Tea Flavour, but any will work. I recommend buying a large bag of powder instead of the ones that come in individual sachets, to cut down on plastic waste.)

500 mL boiling water

## Instructions

### Brew Your Own Tea option:

Add water and tea leaves to a saucepan.

Place saucepan over maximum heat, covered, until boiling.

Remove saucepan from heat and let steep until the tea is cool enough to touch.

Add milk powder to the bottom of a glass (followed by any optional toppings, like grass jelly or tapioca pearls).

Strain 2/3 of the brewed tea into the glass.

Add liquid sweetener (I use stevia; see recipe notes) to taste.

Mix well, and place in the fridge to cool.

Meanwhile, strain remaining tea into ice molds and place in the freezer to make ice cubes.

Once ice cubes have solidified, pop a few out into your cold bubble tea. Insert straw and enjoy!

d7lxe9,Eridium cocktail,603,14,1569127844.0,0.98,Drink,RAD_or_shite,https://i.redd.it/nwvmzyt5t2o31.png,"The [full video is way better](https://youtu.be/4vdd2byfEt0), just FYI.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I’m showing you how to make the only cocktail guaranteed to give you slag powers: Eridium, from Borderlands.

**Recipe**

* 1.50 oz (45ml) gin (I used Lighthouse)
* .50 oz (15ml) Ardbeg 10-year
* .50 oz (15ml) fresh lemon juice
* .75 oz (20ml) sour blackberry liqueur
* .50 oz (15ml) simple syrup

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly until chilled. Fine strain into your chosen vessel. Garnish with a lemon wheel and smoking thyme. Serve!

**Background**

Creating an Eridium-inspired drink is tricky. All we really know about it is that it’s alien, it powers up Sirens, and it'll mutate the crap out of you if you spend too much time near the stuff wot comes out of it after refinement.

Rather than shy away from the 'weirdness' and the 'mystery', I decided to double down on it: any drink inspired by Eridium has to be just as strange and surprising as the mineral itself. It may look sweet and fruity and floral with its pretty purple hue, but take a sip and you get slapped in the mouth with hefty campfire smoke from the Ardbeg instead.

It's a shock to the senses upon first sip—smoke and berry and gin all mixing on the tongue. This may not be a drink that suits everyone's palette but anyone who wants to try something new (or surprise their patrons) will find this becomes differently delicious after a couple of sips.

Smoky, surprising, sweet and a little bit mysterious—if that isn't 'Eridium', I don't know what that is. Hope you enjoy! And if you like this, you might also be a fan of my take on [Skooma from The Elder Scrolls](https://youtu.be/Qk07VGskfso).

d76t3n,Fresh sugarcane juice for rum?,17,1,1569045561.0,0.92,Drink,mark30322,https://i.redd.it/iz9fflei0wn31.jpg,"Start with eight cups of water in a four quart saucepan. Since you’re basically making a simple syrup, the ratio is easy to remember: combine equal parts water and piloncillo.

Bring this combo to a simmer over medium heat. Stir it occasionally to encourage the piloncillo to break up and dissolve. The great part of making guarapo this way is that you not only get a refreshing drink, you get one that tastes a little like caramel. Once the piloncillo has dissolved, allow the mixture to simmer for four minutes. This ensures it’s completely dissolved. Remove the pot from the stove, and allow it to cool completely. You can even transfer it to the fridge to get it ice cold if you want.

If you were to serve this guarapo without an acid to cut the sweetness, you’d probably be pinging for days. Since I serve this to the Twinks, mid-afternoon, as an energy booster to get through school, I temper the sugar with the tart lime juice. Roll the limes between the palm of your hand and the counter. This helps break up the fibers inside and gets the juices flowing so you can get the most from your limes. Now grab a small cutting board and your chef’s knife and cut your limes in half.

Use your citrus juicer to extract all the juice you can from each half. You’ll need one cup of lime juice, which is about eight good-size limes. I like to strain the limes juice to remove those rogue seeds that always seem to infiltrate it.

Ingredients

8 oz  piloncillo pressed cane sugar

8 oz cold water

1 cup freshly squeezed lime juice about 8 limes, plus an additional lime, sliced for garnish

4 cups ice or more if desired

Instructions

In a large stock pot, bring the piloncillo and water to a simmer over medium heat. Stir frequently to dissolve the sugar. Once dissolved, allow the mixture to simmer for 4 minutes. Remove from the stove and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature (or place in the refrigerator to cool completely).

Once the guarapo is cold, add the lime juice. Stir to combine.

Fill a large pitcher with the ice and pour the guarapo mixture over it. Stir to cool dilute the guarapo, then add the lime slices, if desired.

d4vdtq,Apple of Eden (inspired by Far Cry: New Dawn),31,4,1568606022.0,0.96,Drink,RAD_or_shite,https://i.redd.it/jjdq6dzhpvm31.png," 

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I’m sharing the secret to true power—but only for the uncorrupted—in this recipe for the Apple of Eden from Far Cry: New Dawn.

**Recipe**

* 2 oz gin
* .50 oz apple shrub
* .50 oz Cointreau
* 2 dashes orange bitters

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly until chilled. Fine strain into your chosen vessel. Serve!

**How to make the apple shrub**

* In a saucepan, combine half a cup of apple vinegar, half a cup of sugar and half a cup of sliced apple.
* Heat slowly until the sugar is totally dissolved.
* Pour into a jar (apple slices and all) and seal, place in fridge overnight.
* Use in this cocktail!

**Background**

What happens when you combine nuclear fallout, potent narcotics and fruit trees? Super-powered apples. Because obviously.

Creating a drinkable version of a Bliss-infused Apple of Eden could be as easy as combining gin, some apple-infused simple syrup and a little lemon juice. But that feels too 'clean'. To really replicate the harsh price the Apple expects, we need to take it one step further and create a drink that you can feel *burning away* the sin inside you.

That’s where the apple 'shrub' comes in: an old-school way of putting sour, sweet and fruity into a cocktail all at once. It's a little more involved than just a simple syrup, adding vinegar and time into the equation, but don't let that put you off: it's still very easy and the payoff is worth it.

Rather than the tasty but uninteresting gin-apple sour, you're instead left with a drink that is an explosion of flavours. It ""tastes sweet"" but has an unexpected acidic bite to it that you can feel cleansing every inch of your very being as it goes down. 

Just make sure you don’t have too many or you’ll end up with a hangover more vicious than a Yeti.

Hope you enjoy! And if you like this, you might also enjoy my recipe for [Nuka Cola from Fallout](https://youtu.be/p1XqJhaEypI) too. Spoilers: it doesn’t make your piss glow. Much.

d4gv5z,Nimbu Pani Indian Lemonade,8,2,1568528420.0,0.79,Drink,mark30322,https://i.redd.it/djwaukbsapm31.jpg,"Ingredients

2 lemons or 3 limes

½ tsp chaat masala

4-5 mint leaves

a few ice cubes

Shrikanji or nimbu pani is a sure fire sign that summer is here.

In India the lemons are smaller and they look like limes so either will do for this recipe, if you can't get hold of chaat masala or black salt then just miss it out.

d16mtt,Cannibal Reviver cocktail from The Forest,9,5,1567917843.0,0.85,Drink,RAD_or_shite,https://i.redd.it/htohpr66val31.png," 

This is just part of a [longer video](https://youtu.be/zY1hR1mXOvg) that talks about The Forest and how it inspired this drink.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I’d like to show you how to make the only cocktail a plane crash survivor needs: the Cannibal Reviver.

**Recipe**

* 1 oz (30ml) gin (I used Lighthouse)
* .50 oz (15ml) lemon juice
* .50 oz (15ml) yellow Chartreuse
* .50 oz (15ml) Dolin sweet white vermouth
* 2 dashes Peychaud's Bitters

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly until chilled. Fine strain into your chosen vessel. Serve!

**Background**

I can’t play The Forest. Not for long, anyway. Not because I don’t like it—I was a backer way back in the very early days of development, and I love how the full version has expanded on that initial foundation. No, I can’t play The Forest because I’m an enormous coward.

I can get through the first few hours, enjoying chopping down trees and building a treehouse, but as soon as I need to descend into the caves to actually progress the story… let’s just say it very quickly turns into brown trousers time.

That’s where the Cannibal Reviver comes in---it gives me the courage I need to continue. Rather than trying to recreate the useful but sadly non-unique in-game Molotov Cocktail, I instead decided to go a little more thematic with this Forest-inspired drink.

Modelled after the supposed “hangover cure” cocktail Corpse Reviver #2, the Cannibal Reviver is an Herbal Medicine+ for the mind. Drawing on the green-and-lush feel of the peninsula, it’s distinctly herbaceous with a touch of anise—perfect as a shot of sanity when the game starts to get a little too sp00ky or when cutting down yet another tree gets a little tedious. 

Try swapping the yellow Chartreuse out for green for an even bigger herbal hit.

Hope you enjoy! And if you like this, you might also be a fan of my take on [Skooma from The Elder Scrolls](https://youtu.be/Qk07VGskfso).

cy4sgc,Spitter Spatter cocktail (inspired by Left 4 Dead),12,1,1567306568.0,0.88,Drink,RAD_or_shite,https://i.redd.it/bry1291kdwj31.png," 

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I rounded up a few friends and dipped my toes back into the nostalgia that is Left 4 Dead with a drink inspired by everybody’s least favourite special infected: the Spitter.

**Recipe**

* 1.5 oz (45ml) tequila blanco
* .50 oz (15ml) spiced simple syrup
* .75 oz (20ml) grapefruit juice
* 5 slices cucumber 
* Tonic water

Muddle the cucumber slices in a rocks glass until moderately crushed. Add ice to rocks glass. Add the tequila, grapefruit juice and spiced simple syrup to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly to chill. Strain into the rocks glass and top with tonic water.

**Background**

In making the Spitter Spatter, a drink inspired by my least favourite and most vom-inducing special infected from Left 4 Dead 2, I wanted to achieve a few things.

First, it had to look gross. Muddled cucumber gives it that lovely flemmy look and provides that distinctive green Spitter acid in-game is so known for.

Second, I wanted it to be fairly acidic, almost caustic. I couldn't just dump a bunch of grapefruit juice in there though, as it'd quickly become unpalatable. Combining it with the spiced simple instead gives us a sweet/sour combo that still has a bite of acid, emphasised with some spice.

Lastly, I wanted the drink to be able to glow. It's a defining feature of Spitter acid so we’ll top up the drink with quinine-infused tonic water---which glows under a blacklight. Damn cool party trick to bust out, just FYI.

Hope you guys enjoy!

Laughing at me calling Left 4 Dead “nostalgic”? You might be a fan of the [Green Herb from Resident Evil](https://youtu.be/hHLvkF8SuwY) instead, old-timer.

 Ingredients (with the exception of the basil sugar) are for one drink, but you can easily double/triple/quadruple the recipe as needed.

* 1/2 ounce simple syrup
* 3-4 large basil leaves thinly sliced
* Juice from 1/2 lime plus additional lime wedges for serving
* 2 ounces white tequila
* Ice

#### Basil sugar rim

* 1/4 cup granulated white sugar
* Leaves from 1 sprig basil

* Make basil sugar for the glass rim by combining 1/4 cup sugar and leaves from 1 basil sprig in a food processor. Pulse until the basil leaves are fully incorporated, and you can no longer see whole pieces of leaf in the sugar.
* Pour basil sugar onto a plate. Wet the edges of a small glass with water, and roll the cup onto the basil sugar to form the sugar rim. Fill glass with ice.
* In a cup or drink shaker, combine blackberries, simple syrup, sliced basil leaves, and juice from 1/2 lime. Macerate with a cocktail muddle or a wooden spoon. Add about a cup to a cup and a half of ice (depending on the size of your cup or cocktail shaker). Add tequila, and shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds.

cv1kpg,Cliff Racer cocktail (from Skyrim),29,2,1566693683.0,0.86,Drink,RAD_or_shite,https://i.redd.it/an5zasx4rhi31.png," 

This is a part of a [more detailed video](https://youtu.be/Y5im1L7qL6o) if you want the full story behind where this drink comes from—or just want to hear my dulcet tones.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I kept one eye on the sky and one eye on my shaker as I recreated a drink named after the most frustrating creatures in all of Tamriel: the Cliff Racer.

**Recipe**

* 1 oz whiskey (bourbon also works)
* 1 oz brandy
* .50 oz Campari
* .50 oz red wine simple syrup
* .50 oz fresh lemon juice

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly to chill. Strain into your vessel. Serve!

**Background**

Show me someone that says cliff racers were a fair and balanced enemy, and I will show you a fanboy—or a liar.

Cliff racers were, to use the words I screamed as I was pursued half-way across Vvardenfell, “total bullshit”. They were fast, numerous, incredibly hard to hit and would appear at exactly the worst moment possible.

You might think that escaping to the frozen tundra of Skyrim means you’d finally leave cliff racers behind. But hold your sigh of relief. They’re still around, though perhaps not in the form you’d expect.

Despite their reputation, Talen-Jei of the Bee &amp; Barb in Riften tolerates cliff racers enough to name one of his three original cocktail creations after them. It’s a damn potent drink, combining a series of spirits from every corner of Tamriel to create what is essentially the Elder Scrolls version of a Long Island Iced Tea. There’s a reason he says it’s only suitable for “the brave”.

Finding real life equivalents of all those in-game liquors wasn’t easy, but it was worth it. The Cliff Racer has quickly become one of my favourite recreated vidya drinks, and I hope you guys enjoy it too!

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I strapped on my sword, gun and magic gauntlet and began my journey towards being a big god-damned Hero---but not before stopping off at the local pub for a Yellow Fairy first. Here’s the recipe:

**Recipe**

* 1 oz (30ml) tequila reposado
* 1 oz (30ml) marshmallow syrup
* .50 oz (15ml) yellow Chartreuse
* .50 oz (15ml) lime juice

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly until chilled. Strain into your chosen vessel. Gird thine liver. Serve!

**How do you make the marshmallow syrup?**

* Add ½ cup water to ½ cup(ish) white marshmallows to a saucepan.
* Heat gently and stir until the marshmallows are completely dissolved.
* Take off the heat and allow to cool, about 10 minutes.
* Use in this recipe!

**Background**

Excluding games like Cooking Mama or Overcooked, you'd be hard pressed to find a game where choosing your next meal has as much of an impact as it does in Fable. It can, in fact, become a defining aspect of your character.

Beverages like beer, wine and spirits will make you gain weight, change your level of purity and even give you experience points. Perhaps the most notorious of these drinks is the Yellow Fairy, a highly prized, extremely potent beverage that will heal your body just as much as it damages your liver.

To bring it to the real world, I've combined a very strange selection of ingredients. Tequila for bit of bite and added weight with the oak, yellow Chartreuse for some herbal notes and sweetness, and the marshmallow syrup for the vanilla (and the fact the drink supposedly tastes like marshmallows, according to the in-game description).

All up, it's a sweet, herbal, very potent drink that every Hero, from Bowerstone to Brightwall to Oakvale, should find themselves thirsty for.

Fair warning: this drink isn’t for everyone. It’s got big, deep and dark molasses flavour that is only moderately held in check by the sweetness of the cherries. Be ready for that kick.

**How to make the cherry-molasses syrup**

In a saucepan, combine 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of water. Heat gently (never boil) and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved. Add 2 tablespoons of blackstrap molasses. Stir again until dissolved. Finally, add a handful of chopped cherries to the mixture and simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes until the flavours have combined. Taste regularly to avoid too much reduction.

I make video games (and tabletop games) into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I created an Astartes-tested, Emperor-approved alcoholic take on a Melta Bomb that fuses sweet, savoury and bitter into a drink capable of melting anybody’s social armour. 

Plus it’s a literal bomb cocktail so that’s fun.

**Recipe**

* 1 oz (30ml) Wild Turkey
* .50 oz (15ml) Cointreau
* 1 oz (30ml) Dolin red vermouth
* .50 oz (15ml) Campari
* Lemonade to top

Add the Wild Turkey and Cointreau to a Collins glass without ice. Top up with chilled lemonade to the halfway point. Add the Campari and red vermouth to a separate shot glass. When you're ready, drop the shot glass into the Collins glass, and drink it down in one go. Bonus points if you shout ""For the Emperor!"" first.

If you aren't a fan of the lemonade (or a wet table), ditch it and serve the rest of the ingredients shaken with ice and strained into a martini glass. Who says Warhammer can't be fancy?

Cetrion adds an extremely eclectic moveset to the usual Mortal Kombat crowd, her abilities made up of thrown boulders, summoned flames, battering winds and drowning waters. Despite being the goddess of nature, life, light and all that air-y fairy stuff, this lady can still lay down the pain in a multitude of ways when she wants to.

This cocktail is made up of equally mixed elements: lightly spiced cranberry, sweet and fruity Midori, nutty amaretto and sour lime come together in a cavalcade of flavours which, combined with the layering, creates a beverage that evolves as you sip it.

Find it a little too sweet? Up the lime juice and drop down the Midori.

On to the drink!

When you’re making a drink based around a vampire game, there aren’t many options. Kindred aren’t known for their appetite for *martinis*, after all, and if you don’t come up with something thick, red and bloody-looking, it feels like you missed the point.

And so it is with Vitae, inspired by Vampire: The Masquerade. Making a cocktail around the one substance no vampire could do without is an obvious choice, but there is a madness to the method. Just ask any Malkavian.

Rather than just chucking some grenadine in vodka and calling it a day, this deep red concoction is designed to be much like vitae is described in-game: a sweet, guilty pleasure, equally sustaining and draining at the same time; inherently *more-ish*. Velvet soft and fruity with a hint of spice, it’s a slow sipper perfect for a quiet night in.

But be sure you don’t drink too deep or too often. The Beast is always waiting to pounce…

Hope you guys enjoy.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). Sharpen your katanas (and your reflexes) and prepare for the coming battle with a gourd full of that good stuff.

**Recipe**

* 1.5 oz (45ml) vodka
* 8 slices of cucumber
* .50 oz (15ml) lemon juice
* Sweet, sparkling Mio sake to top

Muddle the vodka and cucumber together. Strain into a separate glass. Add the lemon juice and ice. Shake. Strain into your chosen vessel and top with sparkling sake. Serve!

**Background**

Every difficult game has its mercies, and in Sekiro, it’s the Healing Gourd. Take a wound in battle and all you have to do is hit that button and slurp back some magic healing water and get back into the fight. 

While it isn’t super clear as to what it actually is inside the Healing Gourd (other than the seeds, of course), my own take on that tasty seed juice feels like it has the same restorative properties. It’s got the vodka for the clean healing touch, the cucumber for those precious electrolytes, a little lemon to brighten up a dark day and, of course, sake---because it’s Japan n shit.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I decided to do it like Lance Armstrong and blood-dope my way into victory with a Bloodborne inspired cocktail: the Blood Vial.

**===The Recipe===**

* 1.50 oz (45ml) Wild Turkey bourbon
* .50 oz (15ml) Dolin sweet white vermouth
* .75 oz (20ml) sloe gin
* 2 dashes Angostura orange bitters

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously to chill. Strain into your vessel. Pray for strength against the coming dark. Serve!

**===The Fluff===**

They really went all-out to make Bloodborne as grimdark as possible, huh? I mean, you’ve got the gothic architecture, the monstrous creatures that hide around every corner, the pervading sense of gloom and horror---even the ‘healing potions’ are made of literal blood.

Thankfully, Bloodborne doesn’t require you to chug a bottle full of plasma in order to heal (unless, of course, you consider the comic canon), instead expecting an injection into the leg. But haven’t we all wondered if there might be a less needle-stick-prone way to use a Blood Vial; perhaps as a drink?

Well, wonder no more. The cocktail described above has the answer; sweet-ish, fruity with a splatter of savoury, this is certainly a lifesaver for any Hunter who is about to go into battle (and requires only your strongest potions).

I found a recipe online and adjusted it. Because it requires you to use the whole flower, the flavor is more floral than the raw nectar, but it goes extremely well in cocktails and makes a nice addition to homemade ice cream. 

Recipe for one jar:

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 cup of whole honeysuckle flowers — leaves, stems and other green bits removed (I packed them down a bit, so it was around 50-70 flowers. The recipe I found called for only yellow flowers, but I'm not sure why—perhaps more flavor in the yellow petals?)
* 1 cup of water
* 1 cup of sugar

**DIRECTIONS**

1. Rinse the honeysuckle flowers in a strainer to clean them.
2. Bring the water to a boil. Once it's boiling, add the flowers to the water, and immediately remove from heat.
3. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and leave for ~1 hour. Note: The infused water doesn't smell awesome, but it will taste great once you're done.
4. Strain the flowers out, pressing to ensure the floral flavors are squeezed into the infused water. 
5. Add 1 cup of sugar to the infused water and heat on high, stirring constantly, until the sugar is dissolved. If you want thicker syrup, continue heating for a few minutes until the water boils down.

**===The Recipe===**

* 1 oz (30ml) Aperol

Love potions, as a concept, are pretty gross: “make someone drink this and they’ll fall in love with you---forcefully”. That’s a big yikes. But in a game like The Sims, these potions get a bit of a pass. When players are able (and in some cases even encouraged) to muck their pixelated minions about in every way imaginable---looking at you, pool ladder removers---a magic potion what makes them get love eyes seems just par for the course.

Bright red, full-bodied and a little bittersweet, I reckon Sims-lovers and actual lovers alike will find something to like in this recipe. Hope you guys enjoy!

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I took a deep breath and plunged into the dark, dangerous gothic world of Bloodborne and crafted a beverage that no bloodsucker could resist: the Pungent Blood Cocktail.

**===The Recipe===**

* 2 oz (60ml) Thomson Two Tone Whisky
* .50 oz (15ml) lemon juice
* .75 oz (20ml) simple syrup
* .50 oz (15ml) mulled red wine

Add the first 3 ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly until chilled. Strain into a rocks glass filled with ice. Carefully pour the mulled wine over the top to layer. Serve!

**===The Fluff===**

Bloodborne: it’s a game all about challenge. Sure, the Victorian aesthetic and the weird plotlines are certainly entertaining, but just like its cousin Dark Souls, it’s the masochistic, challenge-seeking side of the gaming community that this really appeals to.

That doesn’t include me. I’m nowhere near skilled, dedicated or patient enough to really git gud. When I play Bloodborne, I have to cheese the hell out of every enemy I fight—which is why I always make sure to carry some Pungent Blood Cocktails with me to distract the bosses I don’t feel like taking head on. Suddenly, that Blood-Starved Beast doesn’t seem quite so tough any more when it’s too busy snuffling at a red streak on the pavement while you beat on it with your oversized weaponry.

Rather than opening up a vein to bring this drink to life (my dedication to this whole shtick stops at death from blood loss), this real-life version is based around a New York Sour. However, the typical bourbon is replaced with the bright and fruity Two Tone Thomson Whiskey (from my homeland of New Zealand), while the wine is made a little more lively with the addition of typical mulling spices: nutmeg, ginger, allspice and cloves.

Lightly sweet, lightly sour, big on fruit with a sprinkle of spice—I reckon it’s an ideal drink to share with the Hunter in your life. Hope you enjoy!

This week, I took a look at the corpses surrounding my colony and decided to get a little creative with this recipe.

**===The Recipe===**

* 1 oz (30ml) Stolen white rum
* .75 oz (20ml) Midori
* .50 oz (15ml) Malibu coconut rum
* White of one small egg
* 2 dashes Peychaud’s Bitters

Add all ingredients except the egg white to a shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously to chill. Discard the ice. Add egg white to other ingredients. Shake thoroughly to emulsify. Strain into a vessel. Serve!

**===The Fluff===**

You might ask me “why did you decide to make a drink from an item in-game that, by its description, tastes like a combo of rancid kitchen sponge and flem?”. To that, I say “who are you and how did you get into my house?”

The real answer is that nutrient paste is just an iconic part of Rimworld; it’s a perfect example of the slightly deranged state of mind that most of its players eventually fall into. You see, nutrient paste is a very useful in-game item, because it can feed a lot of people very cheaply; handy when you have too many colonists and not enough grub. But a lot of players make it by creating what is essentially soylent green out of the corpses of raiders. It can make food from anything organic, after all.

Yeah, Rimworld is kinda just a space cannibalism simulator.

Unlike the in-game item, however, this version of Nutrient Paste is actually pretty tasty. It’s got these fruity, tropical notes from the rums and Midori, while the egg gives it a thicker texture and the protein that every growing colonist needs. A couple of dashes of Peychaud’s to spice things up a bit and boom: it’s a very sippable cocktail to have after a non-human-meat-containing meal.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I decided my regular day job wasn’t quite exciting (or lucrative) enough and decided to dip into the dangerous world of skooma-distilling.

**===The Recipe===**

* 1.5 oz (45ml) Stolen white rum
* .75 oz (20ml) Chambord
* 2 dashes Peychaud's Bitters
* 1 dashes Angostura Bitters

Add all ingredients to a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir vigorously until chilled. Strain into your chosen vessel. Call someone an n'wah. Serve!

**===The Fluff===**

In it’s cute little purple bottle, Skooma is quite easy to write it off as a fun, quirky recreational drug for the people of Tamriel---but in reality, it’s a damnably dangerous, incredibly addictive substance that is the fantasy equivalent of crack.

Seriously, it’s really gnarly when you look into it. It’s made with **nightshade** for God’s sake, and once a person is addicted, it’s supposedly impossible to break the habit. Oh, and on that note, you try it once, maybe as a fun little bit of rebellion in college (or whatever the Elder Scrolls equivalent is), you’re fixed on it for life. It’s a D.A.R.E. campaigners wet dream.

Despite all that, it does have it’s uses: the Khajiit use it in religious ceremonies and even in their cuisine. It’s not a one-dimensional substance.

This was all part of the inspiration for this real life cocktail version of skooma: I wanted to create a subtly more-ish drink with a flavour profile that called back to the humid deserts and warm jungles of Elsweyr, the Khajiiti homeland: fruity up front, transforming into sweet spice at the end. Very tasty---just make sure the guards aren’t watching when you mix up a batch.

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I took a walk in the woods and ended up in the realms of The Entity, the campfire by my side and this drink in my hand.

**===The Recipe===**

* 2 oz (60ml) tequila blanco
* .50 oz (15ml) raspberry simple syrup
* .50 oz (15ml) Cointreau
* .50 oz (15ml) lime juice

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly to chill. Garnish with some raspberries. Strain into your chilled vessel. Serve!

**===The Fluff===**

Mankind, in general, has a love of a bit of the old ultraviolence. Video games, movies, certain sports---we’re very fond of times when the feathers (and blood) start flying.

It’s pretty surprising, then, that it took so long for a game like Dead by Daylight to be developed. It’s got all the good stuff we go to slasher flicks for, with the added bonus of us being right there in the thick of the action.

I do have a confession for you guys though: I’m a wimp when it comes to horror. I get sp00ked really hard when I play stuff like Alien: Isolation or Outlast, and it gets even worse in PvP games like Dead By Daylight---that’s why I have to have some liquid courage to hand, and a recent favourite is the drink described above.

It’s essentially a margarita, with some added tartness (and a splash of crimson) from the raspberry simple syrup; still has all the good times that tequila, Cointreau and lime juice bring, but with a stab of something surprising.

Be warned, though: it’s a very more-ish beverage, and should be made in batches for sharing amongst the other survivors in your life.

I make video games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I thought that it was about time the new star of the latest Hollow Knight game got her own drink too, so I whipped up a cocktail with an aromatic sting: The Hornet.

**===The Recipe===**

* 1.50 oz (40ml) 1919 Gin
* .75 oz (20ml) Lillet Rose
* .50 oz (15ml) lemon juice
* .50 oz (15ml) honey simple syrup﻿

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously to chill. Strain into your vessel. Serve!

**===The Fluff===**

I don’t like platformers. Rather, I should say, I don’t **normally** like platformers—because I love Hollow Knight.

You see, I find it really hard to get into games like Hollow Knight—they’re super technical and skill-based, and I’m not really that good at them. It’s hard to enjoy a game when you’re about to burst a blood vessel trying to beat even the easiest boss.

Hollow Knight, however, is different. Not that it isn’t frustrating at times (it really is), but the world and the characters you get to meet along between those moments of frustration make the aneurysms worth it. The storyline and the people that help to tell it won me over, and none more so than Hornet; one of the few semi-friendly faces you come across. 

This variation on a Bee’s Knees features a couple of unique components: firstly, the Lillet Rose, which gives it a fruity sting, and secondly the 1919 Gin, a New Zealand gin that uses Manuka honey as a botanical---pairs up well with the honey simple. Basically a bouquet in a glass; pretty suitable for a drink named after a Hornet I reckon.

Hope you guys enjoy!

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). I felt like I didn’t have nearly enough polonium in my diet, so I decided to take inspiration from the irradiated wastelands of the Fallout series and recreate its iconic beverage as a cocktail: Nuka Cola.

===The Recipe===

* 1 oz (30ml) Appleton Estate rum
* .50 oz (15ml) blue curacao
* .50 oz (15ml) cherry brandy
* .50 oz (15ml) lemon juice
* Your favourite cola

Add all ingredients except the cola to a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir briefly to chill. Strain into a Collins glass also filled with ice. Add cola to taste. Garnish with a festive umbrella. Serve!

===The Fluff===

Nuka Cola: the beverage of choice for any true red-blooded American in the world of Fallout, both before and after the bombs dropped.

Sure, it might have enough sugar in it to give you instant diabetes, and some of Nuka’s products might have radiation levels that’ll make your pee glow fun colours, but if you don’t have Nuka Cola in your fridge… well, you’re just a God-damned pinko communist, ain’t ya?

A great alternative for when the water is irradiated, this upgraded rum-and-coke is sure to make your geiger counter tick. Hope you guys enjoy!

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I grabbed my closest fairy bottle and chucked the contents into a blender to create the most monstrous Legend of Zelda inspired drink you could possibly imagine.

**===The Recipe===**

* .75 oz (20ml) elderflower liqueur
* .50 oz (15ml) lychee liqueur
* .50 oz (15ml) lemon
* Sparkling rose
* Silver pearl lustre dust

Add the elderflower, lychee and lemon juice to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly to chill. Strain into a champagne flute and top with rose. Add some lustre dust for sparkle. Serve!

**===The Fluff===**

One of the more surprisingly fun mechanics to come out of Breath of the Wild was the cooking system. Every ingredient combo you chucked into the pan offered an opportunity to discover something new and helpful---in fact, you’d be pretty hard-pressed to get anywhere in the game without using the cooking pots scattered around the map.

Of course, you can’t provide a mechanic that encourages experimentation without people trying some seriously weird stuff. Meat and eggs? Sure! Berries and fish? Ehhhh. Let’s just throw a fucking fairy in there and see what happens. Monstrous.

Yeah, you could totally use fairies as an ingredient---you know, those happy little motes of light that just want Link to be happy and healthy? Cooking one up would create a Fairy Tonic---essentially a healing potion. It’s so messed up there’s no way I could NOT recreate it for Experience Bar.

Up top is my take; a floaty, fizzy, aromatic drink that is essentially an upgraded glass of sparkling wine---with a little lustre dust thrown in to add that fairy dust sparkle. And yeah, I know, technically the fairies just fly away unharmed when you cook with them… but let’s not spoil our video game cocktails with technicalities.

Hope you guys enjoy!

The newly rebooted Resident Evil has made one thing extremely obvious: it was incredibly important to have a good imagination to enjoy horror games back in the day. You look at the remaster, and you look at the original, and it’s borderline funny to think how we ever used to find those pixelated zombies and blocky environments scary. If you put the average 12 year old in front of the original Resident Evil, they’d think you were crazy for ever getting spooked.

But we were! It was shocking when those undead dogs crashed through a window, it was terrifying when a corpse sprang to life and took a chunk out of you. Imagination filled in the details.

A lot has changed but the core quality of the titles have remained the same from original to remaster. Now, new players can experience the classics with all the modern day quality of life improvements, and old players can get nostalgic without needing to go hunting down an original PlayStation. And, speaking of older players, now that we’re all adults now, we can enjoy some liquid courage while we relive the sp00ks.

Good luck, and hope you enjoy!

I make video-game-inspired cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). I thought to myself “who says magic juice can’t taste good too?” and created this sparkling, bright blue Diablo-inspired concoction.

**===The Recipe===**

* 1 oz (30ml) white rum

* 1 oz (30ml) blue curacao
* 1 oz (30ml) pineapple juice
* .50 oz (15ml) lemon juice

There’s something very gratifying about playing a game that features explosive magical fireballs. I don’t know if it’s the feeling of absolute cosmic power as you wield the very forces of nature at your fingertips, or if it’s the fact that said power makes enemies go pop so ghoulishly.

That satisfaction very quickly runs out, however, when your spellcaster runs out of that magic blue juice that powers their abilities and discovers, quite painfully, just how squishy they really are.

To prevent this pointed lesson, the wise magic user in Diablo always packs a mana potion or four---but why should the Sorceress and the Necromancer have all the fun? Now you too can enjoy magic (or at least the sparkles of magic) with this purty blue bevvy.

Hope you enjoy!

I make games into cocktails over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I made an Apex Legends drink inspired by everybody’s favourite war criminal: Caustic. Please note, this drink is ABSOLUTELY BANNED if you’re dropping into Bunker...

**===The Recipe===**

* 1.75 oz (50ml) tequila blanco
* .25 oz (10ml) sour apple liqueur
* .25 oz (10ml) amaretto

Man, Apex Legends was a bit of a surprise success wasn’t it? Seemed to just blow out of nowhere, gather an enormous amount of support in just a few days and even knocked Fortnite off the Battle Royale throne. Not bad for a game that had basically no marketing whatsoever before publishing.

But, once you get your hands on it, you realise that the success shouldn’t be a surprise at all: it’s a seriously well-crafted game. From the guns to the map to the simple pleasure of crouch-sliding down a hill, the Apex Legends team has done a damn fine job---if only they would fix the hitbox of my favourite chonky lad, Gibraltar.

The legends you can play as are fascinating as well---even if they are a little cliche at times. My favourite is the ever-edgi Caustic and his weaponised fart machines, and having recently acquired a round-bottomed flask, I knew I had to come up with a cocktail for him.

After a little experimentation (no Geneva convention breaches, I swear), I came up with the drink above; a bright green, very eerie-looking conglomerate of nut, fruit and agave flavours all lifted up with the effervescence of soda water. 

Here’s to blocking doors and laying traps. Hope you enjoy!

* 3 oz montepulciano d’abruzzo
* .50 oz lemon juice

For a game to be truly memorable for me, it has to do one thing extremely well. Memorable doesn’t mean “good” overall, just… memorable.

For Ori and the Blind Forest, it was the aesthetic. For Cataclcysm: Dark Days Ahead, it was the crafting mechanics. For the Elder Scrolls series, it was the sheer breadth of experience. But Assassin’s Creed Odyssey’s most memorable moment for me is far more specific: it was the exact second I first Spartan Kick’d a dude off a cliff. Brought a tear to the eye, that did.

So when designing a drink inspired by this game, it only felt right that any drink I made shared the name of the objectively best skill in the entire franchise.

The drink itself is a big, fruity concoction that has a bite of ouzo to make it as memorable as that first kick, along with some sweet and sour to ensure the licorice flavours don’t overpower everything else. Perfect for a tipple after finally beating that mythological beast.

Hope you guys enjoy!

Strategy games are wasted on me. You can put all the diplomacy, all the politics, all the fluffy nonsense you like in them, and I’m always going to end up just building up an enormous military and wiping the competition off the map. You’ve got to enjoy the simple things in life, you know?

But admittedly, it can get a little boring after a while, especially once you hit the snowball of the late game. Curbstomping squishy aliens with the unstoppable fleets of the Commonwealth of Man is only entertaining for a few in-game decades. Eventually, I want a bit of challenge.

Thankfully, Stellaris offers up a whole variety of powerful xenos to squash by the end-game; the Tyranid wannabes (Prethoryn), iRobot (Contingency) and my personal favourite, the sp00ky space ghosts (Unbidden).

So when it was time to relax and celebrate another decimated alien empire, I decided to create a drink that got its name and its hue from these worthy opponents.

Fun fact: in my current DnD campaign, I play a healer---the only healer. Unfortunately, I’m also the tank, so I get hit a lot. Come to think of it, my character is nearly always the one who gets knocked out first. No wonder his Int score is so low.

During tough fights, this essentially amounts to every round becoming a mad rush for the other players to stick a potion of healing in my character’s gob and pray for a high roll---else they’re going to miss out on that sweet, sweet lay on hands after the rumble.

Most of the time, it works… he’s only died once, which I consider a win.

The point of this rambling DnD story is that potions of healing are important, even if you have a healer in your party. So important, in fact, that it pays to remind people at the table that they exist and they should be bought as often as possible; and what better reminder is there than to have actual healing potions on the table? Though if your experiences are anything like mine, they’ll be empty potion bottles pretty damn quickly...

Imagine that deep under our feet, in a place called the Neath, there is a dark city.

At first glance, this city seems odd, even alien, its pale and suspicious denizens walking streets in perpetual night casting dark glances in your direction. But look a little closer, and you’ll start to see something familiar. Buildings you may have seen in pictures, or even walked by yourself, monuments and palaces that would be postcard-perfect were it not for the gloom. You pass by a sunken clocktower, and suddenly recognise it for what it is, or rather once was: Elizabeth Tower, often known as Big Ben.

Welcome to Fallen London, the home of the Traitor Empress, Queen Victoria: the inspiration for this gin-based, tea-infused cocktail.

The Final Fantasy series is broad. There are dozens of games and spinoffs and sequels, and nearly all of them focus around a different story—kind of ironic for a game with ‘final’ right there in the name.

But despite all that, there’s one item that seems to be in every single title: the Phoenix Down, an item that restores a downed character back to fighting strength---and an obvious choice for a drink inspired by Final Fantasy.

The libation described above won’t get someone back on their feet like a real Phoenix Down would, but it’s an excellent pick-me-up to be served at a brunch or as an aperitif before dinner. Cool, light and refreshing with a little zing of sour.

Remember those ridiculous moral panics around Halloween time when people thought young Trick or Treaters would be getting drugs in their buckets instead of candy? I always found that silly—who in their right mind is going to give drugs away **for free?**

And yet, that’s exactly what happens in Wellington Wells, the addled town in which We Happy Few takes place: a land where “Take your medicine, or else” might as well be emblazoned under the welcome sign.

It’s a curious kind of dystopia, with the happy drug Joy right at its rotten heart.

So, when creating a drink inspired by We Happy Few, Joy was an obvious choice, as were the ingredients, mixing up a drink that is creamy, decadent, perhaps a little bit sinful; a beverage guaranteed to put a smile on your face.

I’ve always believed that video games can be art, and there’s no better demonstration of that than Ori and the Blind Forest. It’s emotive, it’s meaningful, and it’s just outright pretty---what more do you really need from a creative work?

One of the most striking features of the game in this arena is its ability to make you feel the feels: all of them. Happiness, sadness, hope, joy, despair---and no small amount of frustration, especially during the water escape level. But more than anything, it’s a satisfying, cathartic game to play. And I knew I had to replicate that with any drink that bore Ori and the Blind Forest’s name.

So I came up with the warming, sweetened rum-based egg drink up top; a libation you can feel doing it’s good work from the tips of your finger to the bottom of your toes. Hope you guys like it. It’s one of my personal favourites so far.

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I felt like there wasn’t enough M E A T in my beverages, so I concocted this Don’t Starve inspired riff on a Bloody Mary: The Meatball.

* 1 oz (30ml) bacon washed bourbon
* 2 oz (60ml) V8
* .75 oz (20ml) lime juice
* .25 oz (10ml) red wine reduction
* 2 dash Worcester sauce 
* Black pepper

Add all ingredients to a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir swiftly to chill. Strain into a tall glass. Garnish with all kinds of nonsense. Serve!

**===The Fluff===**

In a game like Don’t Starve, where there are monsters and magic and all sorts of other fantastical bullshit to kill you, it feels weird to realise the biggest threat to your survival is your own stomach.

Run out of food---poof! Dead. And it’s an easy thing to run out of, especially in the early game, where new players scramble to find berries and scraps of meat without getting made a meal of themselves.

Thankfully, there is a relatively easy solution in the form of the meatball recipe, which can be cooked up and consumed with only the most basic of ingredients. Every Don’t Starve player will have made a meatball (more likely a whole bunch) at some point, so it’s an easy choice as inspiration for a Don’t Starve cocktail.

This Bloody Mary riff replaces a fair number of the traditional ingredients (and adds even more), but it still retains the soul of the original: namely, a drink that also functions as food---and as a potent hangover cure to boot.

Hope you guys like it!

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I distilled pure essence of git gud into a beverage worthy of a Dark Souls adventurer: the Estus.

**===The Recipe===**

* 2 oz (60ml) spiced rum (I used Captain Morgan)
* .50 oz (15ml) orange juice
* .25 oz (10ml) honey simple
* 2 dashes orange bitters (I used Angostura)

Add all your ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake briskly to chill. Strain into a martini glass. Garnish with an orange peel. Serve!

**===The Fluff===**

I hate Dark Souls. But I love Dark Souls. But I hate Dark Souls. Our relationship is… complicated.

On the one hand, it’s nice to play a game with some challenge to it; a game that makes you earn everything you get and forces you to think about how you play. On the other hand, 95% the reason I die is because of GOD DAMNED BULLSHIT. Or, at least, that’s probably what my neighbours think after my last run.

I can only imagine how frustrating it would be to play through this game without something like the Estus Flask; the only item to give me a second chance after I mistime a sword swing or get kicked off a ledge by a surprise skeltal (doot doot).

So, in the hopes of bringing a little psychological healing and reducing my blood pressure for my next playthrough, I concocted this: the Estus. Hope you guys like it too.

Stardew Valley: is there any game that better embodies relaxation and social reconnection? Take that chillness to the next level with a bourbon-based fruit punch, made to batch up and share.

===The Recipe===

* 1.5 oz (45ml) bourbon (I used Wild Turkey)
* 2 oz (60ml) orange juice
* 1.5 oz (45ml) pear juice
* 0.5 oz (15ml) ginger snap simple syrup
* 0.25 oz (10ml) lemon juice

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Stir for 10 seconds until chilled. Strain into a punch glass. Garnish with an orange twist (optional). Serve!

===The Fluff===

The main drive of Stardew valley isn’t to make money or expand your farm or earn the most points with the villagers—though these are certainly goals you can strive for.

Rather, it’s a game that is based on the idea of escaping the hectic rush of modern day life, excising the stress that seems to be a mandatory part of it, and reconnecting with the social and natural world around you.

Any drink would also have to be able to be scaled up from a single serving—a drink that is best shared with neighbours is perfect for Stardew Valley’s premise of reconnection.

So the Simpler Life Punch was born.

Ryncol has a rep in the Mass Effect universe; a bad one. You see references to it everywhere---in text logs, in conversations, and, in one very memorable interaction, as part of a drink in the Dark Star Lounge on the Citadel.

According to these various experiences, Ryncol seems to be appreciated in the same way that shots of really bad tequila are in student bars: with poor forethought and a significant amount of regret.

Not exactly the best basis to work from when creating a tasty libation, but I like a challenge. Hope you enjoy, and remember: even galactic heroes need to enjoy in moderation.

The Heartless are almost as iconic a part of the Kingdom Hearts series as Sora and his Keyblade---and for good reason. While they may seem simple on the surface (spooky shadow creatures what try to kill you all the time), in reality they have a depth of story and lore to them that would make even the most convoluted anime villain blush.

This drink that shares their name, therefore, is based around the same concept: a pure black beverage that, at first glance, seems like you’d find out everything about it in one sip. But take that sip, and you’ll find it’s got a lot more to it than meets the eye.

This recipe, inspired by Vampyr, comes at you with a rich, dark fruitiness that still packs a savoury bite. Just don’t drink too deep...

===The Recipe===

* 1.5 oz (45ml) aged rum
* 0.50 oz (15ml) Kahlua
* 0.50 oz (15ml) lemon juice
* 0.25 oz (10ml) grenadine

===The Fluff===

Vampires fill a dark but extremely fascinating chapter in folklore. Versions of the myth—bloodsuckers that rise from the grave to feast upon the living—appear all over the world, from the chupacabra of Mexico to the loogaroo of the Caribbean right through to the upyr of Slavic Europe. 

While the myths may vary greatly in terms of what these monsters look like or who (and how) they hunt, one thing remains the same: the undying, obsessive need to drink blood.

Vampyr from DONTNOD Entertainment is no different. Everything is about blood: leveling up, using abilities, even crafting items—it all requires that vitae essential to human life.

When coming up with a drink inspired by the game, I knew that almost fetish-like want was where I needed to draw my inspiration from. After a fair number of experiments, I settled on the thick, dark, and fruity concoction detailed above. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did coming up with it.

Life in the United Cities is hard. If you don’t have cash, influence or a very, VERY big sword (and know how to use it), you’re likely to end up as nothing but a corpse rotting in the desert.

Thievery, crime and smuggling offer a way out for those brave enough to take that path, and there are few commodities more valuable to the would-be larcenist than the highly illegal Bloodrum hoarded by the United Cities aristocracy.

Should someone be able to avoid the samurai guards, break into a noble house, find (and steal) the Bloodrum, escape without being caught AND avoid any smuggling checks by the gatepost guards, a careful thief could fund a great many adventures with just a single jug.

For many, it’s well worth the risk. For those who fail… well. At least the noblemen keep their swords sharp.

Plague hearts: the rotting centre of the zombie menace in State of Decay 2. Fantastically disgusting and fantastically difficult to destroy, even approaching one is courting death, considering the number of blood plague zombies that tend to roam around as undead sentries.

But should the survivors want to survive more long term, those plague hearts have to go, and destroying one is the true test of a zombie-killer’s bottle. It only seems right that, should they succeed, they have a thematically consistent beverage to look forward to once they get back to base. Hence, the Plagued Heart was born.

This week, I decided my current character is a bit shit and in need of a respec, so it’s time to make a draught of Mindwipe Tonic from ARK: Survival Evolved.

There's also a [video version of this one available here](https://youtu.be/G7BZK5vGD7s), if watching is more your thing or you just want to hear my dulcet tones.

===The Recipe===

* 8 blueberries
* 2 oz gin
* 3/4 oz blue curacao
* 1/2 oz lime juice
* Grenadine

Add the blueberries and gin to a mixing glass. Muddle briefly. Strain into a shaker filled with ice. Add blue curacao and lime juice. If the drink is too blue, add grenadine, if it's too red, add more blue curacao. Shake once you've achieved the distinctive purple. Strain into your vessel. Serve!

Everybody makes mistakes, especially when they're new to a game. You put too many points into a useless stat, or you end up with a weak, jack-of-all-trades that gets completely eviscerated by those who specialised. It's particularly frustrating in a highly competitive multiplayer game like ARK: Survival Evolved, where your stats can mean the difference between life and death.

That's why we have things like the Mindwipe Tonic: a craftable stat respec consumable that gives you a second chance at getting gud.

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I decided that simply shooting the bad guys wasn’t fun enough and crafted the melee-enhancing Furious booster from Far Cry 5.

===The Recipe===

* 1 oz gin (preferably a herbal one)
* 3/4 oz Amaretto
* 1/2 oz peach liqueur
* 1/4 oz lime juice
* 2 dashes orange bitters
* cranberry juice

Add all ingredients except cranberry juice to a shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously to chill. Strain into vessel (a flask is great, a martini glass is serviceable). Top with cranberry juice, or to taste. Garnish with a lemon twist. Serve!

===The Fluff===

Far Cry 5 features a set of ‘homeopathic’ performance enhancers that turn the already-destructive tendencies of the player to superhuman levels. One of these boosters is The Furious, which, true to its name, makes the player an incredibly deadly melee combatant. An interesting change of pace in a game mostly about shooting things.

Interestingly, the in-game recipe features a set of ingredients that have real world counterparts---and, with a little creativity, can be replicated in real life. Or at least, close enough. After a little (a lot) of research, I came up with the recipe above which I feel manages to keep the spirit of The Furious without completely ignoring actual good taste.

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, took a deep breath and dived back into the galaxy of No Man’s Sky to create a drink that goes through the same transformation the game has over the years.

===The Recipe===

* 1 oz white rum
* 1 oz lychee liqueur
* 1 oz lime juice
* 8-10 mint leaves
* 2 tsp sugar
* Crushed ice
* Crushed butterfly flower tea ice
* Soda water (optional)

Add the rum, lychee liqueur, mint leaves and sugar to a mixing glass. Muddle gently to release oils. Strain into a separate mixing glass filled with ice, and add the lime juice. Fill a tall glass (such as a Collins glass) to the 2/3rds point with crushed ice. Fill the rest of the way with butterfly flower tea ice. Strain your drink into this glass, watch the colour change, add a straw and serve!

===The Fluff===

Let’s face it: No Man’s Sky was a trainwreck when it first released. People accused it of having missing features, of being filled to the brim with bugs, and of generally not being of the quality that people had been promised.

It was, and still is to an extent, an example of how not to do a game release.

But now, years later, No Man’s Sky is a totally different game. New features, new mechanics, new ways of enjoying the game---not to mention the bug fixes. Hello Games might have messed up the initial release, but they made up for it with the years of support and free updates. Gotta commend them for that.

That transformation, mixed with the sci-fi aesthetic of No Man’s Sky, is where I drew my inspiration from with this drink. It starts off as a bright blue, but transforms in colour over time  to a bright pink, giving the drinkers an almost technicolour display every time they go to take a sip.

If you’re curious about how the colour change works, I’d encourage you to head over to the [main recipe page](https://experience-bar.com/2018/12/16/the-galaxy-awaits-no-mans-sky-video/).

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I settled down into a camper van and drank way, way too much coffee to create a Team Fortress inspired libation: Jar-ate.

===The Recipe===

* 3/4 oz elderflower liqueur
* 1 oz gin
* 1/2 oz lemon juice
* 1/2 oz pineapple juice

Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously to chill. Strain into a small mason jar or cocktail glass. Serve!

===The Fluff===

Sometimes, people tell me I’m taking the piss with my cocktail recipes, and with this drink, I feel like I’m just proving their point.

You see, Jar-ate in Team Fortress 2 is a weapon (I’d call it a war crime) that the Sniper uses to deal extra damage and reveal cloaked Spies. Useful little gadget for sure, especially when you realise that it’s literally just a mason jar filled with urine.

So yeah, making that in-game item into a decent real-life cocktail was tough, but I feel like this tropical, flowery drink manages to to do it. 

If you’re curious about why I decided that this particular combo of ingredients results in the Jar-ate (beyond just “it’s yellow and Jar-ate is yellow”), I’d encourage you to head over to the [main recipe page](https://experience-bar.com/2018/12/09/jar-ate-team-fortress-2/).

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I tattooed my wrists with chains and decided to discover what truly makes a man through a Bioshock-inspired cocktail: The Electro Bolt.

* 1/2 oz blue curacao
* 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
* 1/2 oz apple juice
* 1/2 oz French brandy
* Champagne

Add the first four ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously until chilled. Strain into a coupe, then top up with champagne. Serve!

===The Fluff===

Bioshock is one of my favourite games, period. I was only 14 or 15 when the original was released, and the combination of great gameplay, great mechanics and great story had me hooked from the first step I took out of the bathysphere.

So I was especially excited to finally create a drink inspired by the game, based on the first plasmid you encounter in the game: the Electro Bolt.

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/). This week, I put on my black suit and red tie, stapled a barcode to the back of my head and loaded up my silverballers to recreate an in-game cocktail from Hitman: The Bare Knuckle Boxer.

===The Recipe===

* 1 1/2 oz aged rum
* 1/2 oz vodka
* 4 oz orange juice
* 1 dash Angostura bitters
* 1/4oz salt syrup

Add all ingredients to a mixing glass filled with ice. Stir briefly until chilled. Strain into an old-fashioned glass.

===The Fluff===

Hitman gives you a lot of different ways to assassinate people. Guns, garottes, gravity… but there are few methods more satisfying than slipping someone a little poison, then walking away as if nothing ever happened. 

Unfortunately, I’m not very good at Hitman, so half the time I just work with the “no witnesses, no problem” line of thought and just gun everyone down. 

I did, however, make an exception for one mission: Showstopper, in which you are given the chance to poison the target’s favourite cocktail. A game-related cocktail, with an actual recipe? Of course I had to recreate it.

Unfortunately, the ingame recipe is pretty bad, so I jiggled it around a little to make it more palatable. If you’re interested in what I changed and why, I encourage you to head over to the [main recipe page](https://experience-bar.com/2018/11/25/bare-knuckle-boxer-hitman-2/).

This week, I felt like I didn’t have nearly enough polonium in my diet, so I decided to take inspiration from the irradiated wastelands of the Fallout series and recreate its iconic beverage as a cocktail: Nuka Cola.

* 1/2 oz blue curacao
* 1/2 oz cherry brandy

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/), and this week I took a dive into the depths of the rebooted Tomb Raider franchise.

Lara is a survivor. She's been through tigers, tombs, undead creatures and curses, coming out the other side tougher than ever. She's the embodiment of 'what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger'.

Of course, that kind of growth---from a young woman to a hardened killer---doesn’t come without sacrifice; literal and figurative.

This idea of sacrifice is a recurring theme in the rebooted Tomb Raider games, and the theme that I drew from to create this extremely edgi-ly named drink.

Slowly remove the old fashioned glass from the cinnamon pile and return to an upright position. Strain your drink into the glass; the smoke should pour out. Flame the orange peel into the drink and drop into the glass. Serve!

I make video-game-inspired cocktail recipes over at [Experience Bar](https://experience-bar.com/), and this week I decided to take a break from shooting people’s hats off and create a cocktail inspired by Red Dead Redemption 2.

Alcohol was kind of a big deal in the Wild West. Commerce, medicine, leisure—there were few activities in which a tumbler of bourbon wouldn’t find a home.

And if the Red Dead Redemption series was a simple Western where players gallivant around rolling hills and plains, shooting ne’erdowells and rescuing damsels in distress, we might throw in a sugar cube, a dash or two of bitters and some lemon juice into a shot of bourbon and call it a day. A simple drink for a simple game—no offence Old Fashioned fans.

But Red Dead is about a lot more than that. It’s about freedom, conflict, the process and progress of civilisation, and the ultimate demise of the ‘Wild’ part of the Wild West.

So I came up with this twist of a Manhattan to represent that conflict: bourbon for the wild, vermouth for encroaching civilisation, and some ‘gunsmoke’ for the inevitable conflict between the two. If you’d like to learn more about the drink, I’d encourage you to head over to the [main recipe page](https://experience-bar.com/2018/11/03/death-of-the-west-red-dead-redemption-video/).

While other support characters might get their fellows back into the fight with spells, herbs or medkits, the Battlefield medic takes a slightly more old school approach: namely, chasing down their comrades and sticking them with a great big bloody needle.

Can't fault them though, it does work. Many losses have been averted through that war crime of a medical device.

That's why I decided to celebrate the Battlefield medic with a cocktail of their own; featuring a syringe (of course) and a special ingredient that changes colour when exposed to acid.

When Alexios/Kassandra aren’t busy murdering people via spear thrusts to the face or press-ganging people into their crew, they like to enjoy a little bit of downtime. And they wouldn’t be true Ancient Greeks if that downtime didn’t include enjoying a wholesome cup of wine (or three)---or maybe a suitable cocktail?

The Spartan Kick is a red wine cocktail that features a big fruity Italian red (I know, Romanum eunt domus etc) alongside some rum for an extra kick (hurr hurr) and a splash of ouzo for a modern Greek twist.

But for now, hope you enjoyed the recipe, and I’d love to know what you guys think about this one---definitely one of my strangest.

My experiences with Fortnite have been mostly brief. I’m too unskilled to make any real headway, falling into the constant cycle of lobby-dropping-instant death-lobby-dropping-instant death and so on.

But those long lobby wait times did give me an opportunity to come up with this Fortnite-inspired cocktail. Now, maybe the Save the World version will be a little more to my tastes...

Come with me on a journey to a world beneath the world.

Imagine that deep under our feet, in a place called the Neath, there is a dark city. A city home to hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of denizens. At first glance, this city seems odd, even alien, its pale and suspicious denizens walking streets in perpetual night casting dark glances in your direction.

But look a little closer, and you’ll start to see the familiar. Buildings you may have seen in pictures, or even walked by yourself, monuments and palaces that would be postcard-perfect were it not for the gloom. You pass by a sunken clocktower, and suddenly recognise it for what it is, or rather once was: Big Ben.

Welcome to Fallen London, the home of the Traitor Empress, Queen Victoria: the inspiration for this gin-based, tea-infused cocktail. Let me know what you think!

9e8tlx,Not So Sweetpea,9,1,1536451727.0,0.78,Drink,RAD_or_shite,https://imgur.com/hSPvPLf,"Central to the story of Telltale’s The Walking Dead is Clementine; “sweetpea” to her protector/father figure Lee. We see her go from a spooked little girl to a certified badass, learning the rules of desperate survival and eventually passing them on to her own ward, AJ (or “goofball”).

To do that, she has had to ultimately leave the “sweetpea” behind---doing the things that are necessary for survival among the dead require you to lose your childhood innocence and naivety behind pretty fast.

With that thematic inspiration in mind, I created the Not So Sweetpea in Clementine’s honour. Originally based on the [Sweet Pea](http://imbibemagazine.com/sweet-pea-cocktail/), but a little drier and earther, it combines the green flavours of snow peas, the herbaceousness of gin and the floral notes of elderflower liqueur.

* 1.5 oz gin
* 0.5 oz snow pea simple syrup\*
* 0.75 oz lemon juice
* 0.25 oz elderflower liqueur

Add all ingredients to a shaker half filled with ice. Shake vigorously until chilled. Strain into a coupe glass, garnish with a lemon (or lime), a snow pea and serve!

\*Snow pea simple syrup is made by adding half a cup of chopped snow peas (skins included) and a cup of sugar to a cup of water. Heat until boiling, stirring in the sugar.  Take off the heat, then leave for 30 minutes to infuse.

Can be made with any citrus peel but typically I use lemons. If you change the type of citrus just understand you might have to use a different number of them to get the same amount of zest.

Limoncello

Ingredients

* 10 large lemons
* .75 L of Everclear
*  .75 L of water (3 1/4 cups)
*  1.25 lbs of sugar

Instructions

* Wash the lemons well and then dry them. 
* Peel the lemons being sure to peel as little of the pith (the white part) away as possible. The pith supposedly turns the limoncello bitter so if you do end up getting a lot of the pith it may be worth while to go back and scrape it off. (Using the leftover lemons to make lemonade is always a good idea)
* After this you will take the peels and place them in a glass or plastic container and fill the container with the everclear.
* The mix should then be put in a dark, cool place for up to a month or so and you should take it out and shake it up every 3-4 days.
* Once a month has passed take out the mixture and strain it through a mesh strainer or cheese cloth to separate the peels and set the everclear aside.
* Next boil the water and mix in the sugar to create a simple syrup.
* Let the syrup cool to room temperature (important) and then combine the syrup and everclear. 
* Bottle the mixture and place it in the freezer for up to 2-4 weeks before drinking.
* When it is ready to drink always serve in chilled shot glasses.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/8dbm3q/lemoncello_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/8dbm3q/lemoncello_recipe/

85j81f,Pomelo Oolong Tea With 600% Daily Vitamin C Intake,655,56,1521463918.0,0.92,Drink,ahkun,https://i.redd.it/twwa9o2svpm01.jpg,"The idea of 600% of your daily Vitamin C intake *sounds* good, but it doesn't give you any benefit.

[Here's an article about it](https://www.livestrong.com/article/479278-how-much-vitamin-c-can-the-body-absorb/), but I'll give you the highlights:

&gt;Women need to consume 75 milligrams of vitamin C daily, while men should get 90 milligrams

&gt;when you boost your intake above the recommended dietary allowance, you won't gain the benefit unless you spread it out over several meals or supplement doses. Consuming too much vitamin C at one time decreases its absorption into your system.

&gt;You should not consume more than 2,000 milligrams of vitamin C daily from food or supplements. Getting more than the upper tolerable intake from any source may cause side effects, such as diarrhea and stomach cramps.

If the dosage in this tea is based on the above recommended dietary allowance, then 4 cups of this tea could cause these negative side effects.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/85j81f/pomelo_oolong_tea_with_600_daily_vitamin_c_intake/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/85j81f/pomelo_oolong_tea_with_600_daily_vitamin_c_intake/

Prep time: 2 hours

Cooking time: 1 hour

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients

* Beef shin 500g
* Beef tomatoes x 4-5
* Pure cane sugar 20g
* Star anise x 1
* Cinnamon stick x ½
* Bay leaf x 3
* Ginger x 3 slices
* Soybean paste 1 tablespoon

Instructions

1. Soak the beef in cold unseasoned water ahead of time to get rid of the excessive blood in the meat.
2. Change the water 2-3 times while soaking your beef. Towards the end, you should be able to notice, the meat has visibly become “whiter”.
3. While we are soaking the beef shin, we can start preparing the beef tomatoes. Give them a light cross cut on top. Make sure you cut through the skin.
4. Bring a pot of water to a boil and gently drop your tomatoes in, let them sit for a good 30 seconds.
5. Take them out and rinse under cold water then peel their skin off.
6. Cut peeled tomatoes into small chunks, approximately 2cm x 2cm.
7. Heat up a cooking pot, and add ½ tbsp of vegetable oil, wait for it to heat up. Add 1 star anise, ½ cinnamon stick, 3 pieces of bay leaves, and 3 slices of ginger in the oil quickly stir fry.
8. After the smell of the spices is released, add your beef shin in the pot and 1 tbsp of Soybean (yellow bean) paste, stir fry until meat is browned nicely.
9. Add tomatoes to the pot with ¼ tsp of salt, mix well, put the lid on, and let it cook on medium-high heat until tomatoes are soft.
10. Add 20g pure cane sugar to the stew. Change to low heat and let it cook until tomato juice could cover your meat in the cooking pot.
11. Take the spices out and put the stew in your pressure cooker. I set mine to stew mode, which is 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can cook this in a pot but you may need to cook for longer to allow for the stew to reduce.
12. Serve and garnish it any way you want.

The colder months are upon us, and in England, there’s no heartier dish for the evening than Steak and Ale Pie with Guinness. This versatile recipe is expertly balanced to mitigate the bitterness of the stout, earning it the title of Best Ale Beef Pie. Additionally, I’ve included methods for preparing it solely as a stew or using a slow cooker for added convenience. Lets get cooking!

**Ingredients:**

\* 1.1 lbs Beef stewing steak - (500g) diced

\* 3 Onions, medium size - peeled and diced

\* 2 Carrots, medium size - peeled and diced

\* 1 Celery stalk - fine dice

\* 6 Garlic cloves - sliced

\* 1.1 lbs Potatoes - (500g) large dice

\* 1 can Guinness - (440ml) or other ale or stout

\* 1.7 cups Beef stock - (400ml)

\* 2 tbsp Tomato paste

\* 1 tbsp Fresh thyme

\* 1 tsp Black pepper

\* 2 tbsp Vegetable oil

\* 2 tbsp All-purpose flour

\* 1 sheet Ready-rolled puff pastry

\* 1 Egg - beaten (for glazing)

**Instructions:**

**1.** In a large pot or deep skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Toss the beef cubes in flour, shaking off the excess, and brown them in the hot oil. Remove and set aside.

**2.** In the same pot, add a bit more oil if needed and sauté the onions, carrots, and celery until softened. Add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes.

**3.** Pour in the Guinness and beef stock, then add the tomato paste. Stir well, ensuring all the brown bits from the bottom of the pot are incorporated.

**4.** Add the browned beef back into the pot, season with salt and pepper, and stir. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 1 hour.

**5.** After 1 hour of simmering, add the diced potatoes into the pot and continue simmering for another 30 minutes to 1 hour, or until the beef is tender and the sauce has thickened.

**6.** Preheat your oven to 356℉ (180°C) in preparation for baking the pie.

**7.** Once the filling is ready, if you prefer a thicker sauce, you can thicken it further using a gravy mix or a slurry of flour and water. Stir until the desired consistency is achieved. Transfer the thickened filling to a pie dish. Roll out the puff pastry and place it over the top of the filling, crimping the edges. Make a small slit in the centre for steam to escape. Brush the top with the beaten egg for a golden finish.

**8.** Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.

**9.** Allow the pie to rest for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy with a side salad or additional vegetables if desired :)

17d19ax,Caribbean Beef and Potato Pasty (Trinidad Aloo Pie),494,35,1697890605.0,0.98,Beef,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/xuydsc9fsjvb1.jpg,"Check out rich flavours of Caribbean Food with this authentic Aloo Pie recipe, a delectable Pie with Beef and potato filling. Renowned as a staple in Caribbean street food, this beef hand pie is a perfect dish that embodies the essence of the tropical islands.

To craft this savoury treat, the beef is marinated and slow-cooked to perfection before being enveloped in a crisp dough, ready for shallow frying. Drawing inspiration from Trinidad’s unique fusion of African, Creole, and Indian culinary traditions, this dish stands out in its flavour profile. Enjoy Cooking!

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for the marinade:**

\* 0.9 lbs Beef Shin - (400g) small dice (or other stewing cut)

\* ½ tsp Salt

\* ½ tsp Black Pepper

\* 2 Scallions - sliced and washed

\* 1 handful Cilantro - (Coriander)

\* 1 Tomato, medium size - diced

\* 1 tbsp Ketchup

\* 1 tsp Mild Curry Powder

\* ½ Lime, juice only

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for the Aloo filling:**

\* 3.5 oz Peas - (100g)

\* 14 oz Potatoes, waxy type - (400g) peeled and cut in small dice (keep them in water until needed)

\* 1 tsp Cumin

\* 1½ tbsp Mild Curry Powder

\* 1 Red chilli - small dice

\* 3 Garlic clove - minced

\* 1 Onion, medium size - sliced

\* 3 tbsp Vegetable Oil

\* 1 Beef stock cube

\* 2½ cups Water - (600ml)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for the Aloo pastry:**

\* 10 oz All Purpose Flour - (280g) sieved

\* ¼ tsp Ground Cardamom

\* ½ tsp Ground Turmeric

\* ½ tsp Salt

\* 2 tsp Baking Powder

\* ¾ cup Water - (175ml)

\* 1⅓ cup Vegetable Oil - for shallow frying

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions for the Aloo Pie filling:**

**1.** To start off, marinate the beef with a blend of salt, pepper, spring onions, coriander, tomato, ketchup, curry powder and lime juice. You may choose to marinate the beef overnight or just before cooking.

**2.** In a frying pan, heat 3 tbsp of oil over medium heat. Introduce onion, garlic, and chili, cooking until they turn golden-brown, around 5 minutes. Incorporate the curry powder and ground cumin, cooking for an additional 2 minutes. Pour in 4tbsp of water, allowing it to evaporate completely over the next 5 minutes.

**3.** Incorporate the marinated beef into the pan, mixing thoroughly. Cover the pan, reduce the heat, and simmer for 35 minutes.

**4.** As the beef continues to cook, introduce potatoes and water, followed by a beef stock cube. Allow it to come to a boil before reducing to a simmer. Continue cooking uncovered for about 50 minutes or until it thickens and most of the water evaporates. Add peas in the last 10 minutes of cooking. Taste and adjust seasonings accordingly. Once done, transfer to a large plate, spreading it out to expedite cooling and ease handling.

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions for the pastry and assembly:**

**1.** Begin dough preparation by combining sieved flour with baking powder, salt, turmeric, and cardamom. Knead this mixture into a ball, cover, and let it rest for a minimum of 30 minutes.

**2.** Dust your workspace with flour, dividing the dough into 8 even balls. Roll each into approximately 10cm diameter circles. Spoon the beef mixture into each circle's centre, sealing by folding and pinching the edges. Moistening the edges may aid in ensuring they adhere.

**3.** Position the pies on a cloth, potentially covering them with another cloth to retain moisture.

**4.** Preheat oil in a pan to 374℉ (190℃) in readiness for shallow frying. Fry each pie for about a minute on each side. After frying, drain excess oil by placing the pies on paper towels.

**5.** Once all pies are cooked, serve them with mango chutney, salad, and dressing of your choice for a complete meal experience. Enjoy!

* 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil

**For serving:**

* Cooked white rice or cooked noodles
* Sesame seeds
* Minced scallion greens

**Marinate the beef:**

1. Whisk together the cornstarch, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, minced ginger, white pepper, and sesame oil in a bowl. Whisk until no lumps remain, and add the beef. Toss to coat and transfer to the refrigerator for 15–20 minutes.

**Prepare the aromatics and vegetables:**

1. As the beef marinates, prepare all vegetables and aromatics. Keep the mushrooms in one bowl, the mixed vegetables in a separate bowl, and the aromatics in another bowl.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Whisk together the sauce ingredients in a small bowl until no lumps remain. Set aside.

**Cook the vegetables:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for 8–10 minutes until golden brown. Season with a sprinkle of salt and transfer back to their bowl.
2. If the skillet is dry, add another drizzle of neutral oil over medium-high heat. Add the mixed vegetables and spread them into an even layer. Cook, turning occasionally, for 4–5 minutes.
3. Add the aromatics to the skillet with the vegetables and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. At this point, the vegetables should be tender-crisp. Remove them from the skillet and transfer them back to their bowl.

**Fry the beef:**

1. Add 1 tablespoon of neutral oil to the skillet. Turn the heat to medium-high. Once hot, add the beef and cook for 3–5 minutes until just barely cooked through. Turn the beef once or twice as it cooks.

**Finish the stir-fry:**

1. Pour the sauce over the beef and scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the skillet. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 2–3 minutes or until the beef is cooked and the sauce is thick.
2. Add the cooked mushrooms and cooked mixed vegetables. Toss to coat and cook for 1–2 minutes more. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the stir-fry over cooked rice or noodles. Garnish with sesame seeds and minced scallions. Enjoy!

**Beef:**

* ¼ cup flour
* 2 pounds beef stew cubes
* 2 teaspoons black pepper (freshly cracked, preferably)
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 1–2 tablespoons neutral oil, for frying

**Beef stew:**

* 8 ounces mushrooms, trimmed and sliced
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil, if needed
* 1 large yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 3 ribs celery, trimmed and sliced on a bias
* 4 carrots, peeled and sliced into rounds on a bias
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 heaping teaspoon dry thyme
* ¼ cup flour
* 4 cups of water or beef stock plus 1–2 cups more
* 1 cup frozen peas
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Brown butter noodles:**

* 16 ounces wide egg noodles
* 5 tablespoons butter, cut into evenly-sized pieces
* ⅓ cup loosely packed fresh parsley, minced
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prepare the beef:**

1. Add the flour, black pepper, salt, and paprika to a large bowl and stir to combine.
2. Blot off any excess liquid from the beef. Add it to the bowl with the flour and toss to coat.

**Brown the beef:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the beef in an even layer. Do not overcrowd the pot; you will likely need to brown the beef in batches. Cook for 3–5 minutes on each side until browned all over. Transfer to a large bowl and keep the pot on medium-high heat. Add more oil, as needed, while browning the beef.

**Cook the mushrooms:**

1. Add the sliced mushrooms to the pot. Cook, turning occasionally, for 7–8 minutes until lightly browned. Continue cooking for an additional 2–3 minutes until deep golden brown. Season lightly with salt and transfer to the bowl with the beef.

**Sauté the mirepoix:**

1. If the pot is dry, add another drizzle of neutral oil. Turn the heat to medium and add the onion, celery, and carrots. Season all over with salt and pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, for 7–8 minutes until the onions are translucent and the carrots begin to brown around the edges.
2. Melt the butter in the pot and add the garlic and thyme. Toss to coat and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the stew:**

1. Sprinkle the flour over the aromatics and toss to coat. Cook for 1–2 minutes until nutty and aromatic. Add ½ cup of the water or beef stock and whisk to form a slurry. Continue adding the liquid, in ½-cup increments until all 4 cups of liquid have been incorporated. 
2. Return the beef and mushrooms to the pot. Add the remaining 1–2 cups liquid if needed to ensure the beef is completely submerged with liquid. Taste and season the broth with more salt and pepper, if needed. *Note: You may need to add more liquid as the beef cooks. You can use additional beef stock or continue adding water if the broth of the stew evaporates too quickly.*
3. Reduce the heat on the beef stew to low. Cover and simmer and 1½ hours. Check the stew occasionally and add more liquid as needed.

**Finish the stew:**

1. Uncover the stew and simmer for an additional 15–20 minutes, uncovered. Taste and season once more to your preferences.
2. Add the frozen peas and cook for 5 minutes until warmed through and bright green. Turn off the heat.

**Prepare the noodles:**

1. As the stew finishes simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse and set aside. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.
2. Turn the heat to medium and add the butter. Whisk often for 5–7 minutes until it turns golden brown and takes on a nutty aroma. As soon as the butter browns, add the garlic and parsley and turn off the heat. Stir constantly off the heat for at least 30 seconds to cook the garlic and prevent the butter from burning.
3. Once the butter is nice and fragrant and garlicky, add the cooked noodles and toss to coat. Add salt and pepper to taste. If your noodles are cold, you can return the pot to the stovetop and warm them up over gentle heat right before serving.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the cooked noodles between bowls and pile the stew on top. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13hgyi9/beef_stew_with_brown_butter_noodles/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13hgyi9/beef_stew_with_brown_butter_noodles/

1. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl with the extra virgin olive oil, ancho chili powder, paprika, and cayenne powder. Taste and add more salt, if needed. Toss to coat. Return to the baking sheet in an even layer and roast for 20–30 minutes until golden brown.

**Dress the potatoes:**

1. Wipe out the bowl you used to season the potatoes and add lime juice, minced cilantro, and minced serrano pepper.
2. Carefully add the roasted potatoes to the bowl and toss to coat. Taste and season once more with salt and pepper if needed. Transfer to a serving bowl.

**Cook the steak:**

1. Place a skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Add a scant amount of neutral oil and use a paper towel to brush it into an even layer. The skillet should be slick but not pooling oil anywhere.
2. Pat the steak dry and season with salt, pepper, and chili powder.
3. Turn the heat on the skillet to high. Let it continue to heat for 1–2 minutes. Add the steak and cook without moving for 3–4 minutes. Flip and continue cooking, adjusting the heat if needed until it reaches your desired internal temperature. Skirt steak only needs to cook for 3–4 minutes per side, depending on how thick it is. Transfer it to a plate and cover with foil to rest for 5–10 minutes.

**Fry the vegetables:**

1. Return the heat on the skillet to medium-high. Add another drizzle of neutral oil and let it heat for 1 minute. Once hot and shimmering, add the sliced peppers and onion. Cook, turning occasionally, for 5 minutes until tender-crisp and charred in spots. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to one side of a serving platter.

**Slice the steak:**

1. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and slice thinly against the grain. Transfer to the other side of the serving platter with the cooked peppers.

**To serve:**

1. Pile the steak and peppers into warm tortillas with shredded lettuce. Spoon the mango-avocado salsa on top. Serve the warm roasted potatoes on the side.

**Ingredients for Beef Quesadilla:**

\* 400g (14.1oz) of the diced beef shin (or other cuts high in connective tissue)

\* 150g (5.3oz) Oaxaca cheese or substitute with mozzarella

\* 200g (7oz) sweet bell peppers, seeds removed and sliced

\* 1 medium onion roughly chopped

\* 2 garlic cloves minced

\* 1tsp mild chilli powder

\* 1tsp ground cumin

\* 1tsp cumin seeds

\* 1tsp dried or fresh oregano

\* 2tsp paprika

\* 1tbsp of chipotle paste

\* 500ml (0.52quarts) of beef or vegetable stock

\* 1tbsp tomato paste

\* 5g (0.17oz) chopped parsley

\* 1tsp of salt

\* 4 medium-size wraps (20cm (8inch) diameter)

\* vegetable oil

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Beef Quesadilla:**

**1.** Marinate the beef in cumin, paprika, chili powder, marjoram, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of oil. You can marinate the beef the day before or at least 30 minutes before cooking.

**2.** Fry the meat with onions on high heat to colour and transfer to the slow cooker (you can use a pot or leave it in the same pan as well) add stock to cover the meat and add one tsp of salt. Set the slow cooker on high setting for 3-4 hours (for overnight cooking, keep the beef in larger pieces and set on low setting)

**3.** While the beef is cooking, fry the sweet peppers on medium heat for about 10 minutes, and set them aside for later.

**4.** When the beef is tender, remove it from the slow cooker, and let it cool for a few minutes in the cooking juices. Then, remove it from the liquid, and shred it with your fingers. Mix the shredded beef with the fried sweet peppers, chopped parsley, tomato paste, chipotle paste and some of the meat cooking juices.

**5.** Brush one side of the tortilla with olive oil and place it on a heated frying pan. Add cheese to one side and top with the shredded beef mixture. Once the tortilla is golden-brown, fold it over and flatten slightly.

**6.** Remove the quesadilla from the pan and cut it in half before serving. Enjoy with your favourite Mexican toppings! Enjoy!

129siy8,Sweet and Spicy Lemongrass Beef Stir-Fry,704,20,1680457835.0,0.99,Beef,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/qk8awk15eira1.jpg,"**Recipe here originally: [Sweet and Spicy Lemongrass Beef Stir-Fry](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/lemongrass-beef-stir-fry/)**

**Beef:**

* 1 tablespoon lemongrass paste
* 2 teaspoons minced ginger
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 4 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper, trimmed and minced, or use a serrano pepper
* 1 teaspoon chili oil
* 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch or sweet potato starch
* 16 ounces skirt steak or flank steak

**Stir-fry:**

* 3 tablespoons neutral oil, divided
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and halved lengthwise and thinly sliced into wedges
* 8 ounces snow peas, tough string removed from both sides of the snow peas
* 1 red bell pepper, trimmed, seeded, and sliced into strips
* 1 teaspoon minced ginger
* ¼ cup water
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Cooked white rice
* Fresh cilantro or minced scallions
* Lime wedges
* Crispy shallots

**Make the rice:**

* Before beginning, I recommend making a pot of rice first. Then, keep it warm as you prepare the stir-fry.

**Prepare the marinade:**

* Gather all of the ingredients for the marinade except the cornstarch and beef in a large bowl. Stir until completely combined. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add the cornstarch and stir until smooth. Set aside.
* Pat the beef dry and cut (with the grain) into 4-inch long pieces to make it easier to slice into strips. Next, cut the resulting beef pieces against the grain into ½-inch wide strips. Cutting against the grain will yield the most tender beef, so be mindful of how you slice!
* Add the beef to the bowl of marinade and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator for 15–30 minutes.

**Cook the vegetables:**

* Heat half the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the onion, snow peas, and red bell pepper. Cook in batches if needed. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the pepper begins to char and the snow peas are bright green and tender, about 5–7 minutes. Stir in the ginger and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.
* Remove the vegetables from the skillet and transfer to a bowl.

**Cook the beef:** 

* Add the remaining oil to the skillet over medium-high heat.  Once hot, pour in the beef with all of the marinade. A splatter screen will help with the sputtering! Spread the beef into an even layer. Cook for 3–4 minutes until the beef begins to brown and the marinade is bubbling.
* Crank the heat during the first 3 minutes and watch it closely to develop a sear on the beef without burning the marinade. Then, adjust the heat back to medium-high. It will look like the sauce separates as it cooks, but don’t worry!
* After 3–4 minutes, flip the beef and continue cooking, often turning, for 2–4 minutes or until the beef is mostly cooked through.
* Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and stir to develop a thick sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings. Turn off the heat and stir in the vegetables. Toss to coat.

**To serve:**

* Arrange the cooked white rice on a serving platter and pile the stir-fried beef and vegetables on top. Garnish with cilantro, scallions, lime wedges, and crispy shallots.

11h2fbv,Bigos - Polish Hunter's Stew,2816,83,1677854475.0,0.98,Beef,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/hva4l1m7djla1.jpg,"Check out my family winter recipe for Bigos!

Originally posted here: [**Bigos Recipe**](https://chefsbinge.com/bigos-polish-hunters-stew/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for Bigos:**

\* 14.1 oz stewing beef (400g) cut into large dice (chuck, skirt, leg, or flank works well)

\* 8.8 oz kielbasa (250g) smoked sausage, such as podwawelska

\* 5.3 oz lardons (or chopped bacon)

\* 17.6 oz sauerkraut (500g) drained and rinsed

\* 17.6 oz white cabbage sliced

\* 1 large onion diced

\* 1 apple peeled and diced

\* 1 cup dried mushrooms (50g) (porcini or boletus)

\* 4 cups boiling water (1L) enough to cover everything in the slow cooker

\* 1 glass dry red wine (240ml)

\* 1 prune

\* 2 bay leaves

\* 4 allspice berries (or 1/4 tsp allspice powder)

\* 1 tsp marjoram

\* 1 tsp caraway (helps with digestion)

\* 1 tsp honey (add enough to balance sourness)

\* 2 tsp salt

\* 1 tsp ground black pepper

\* 1 pinch nutmeg

\* 1 tbsp tomato puree

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Bigos:**

**1.** Begin by hydrating the dried mushrooms in 1 L of boiling water for around 15 minutes. When ready, remove the mushrooms and strain the water through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any grit or sand. Transfer the mushroom water to a slow cooker dish, leaving behind the last 50 ml (1/4 cup) of water that may contain sediment.

**2.** In a frying pan, sear the lardons and sausage over high heat until browned. Transfer the meat to the slow cooker, leaving the fat in the pan.

**3.** In the same pan, brown the diced onions until softened and lightly browned. Transfer them to the slow cooker.

**4.** Next, brown the diced beef in two batches until browned on all sides. Transfer it to the slow cooker.

**5.** Add all the remaining ingredients to the slow cooker, including the hydrated mushrooms, and stir well to combine. Cover with a lid and set the slow cooker to high heat for 5 hours. After the first hour, give it a good stir and repeat every hour or so to distribute the flavours.

**6.** When the Bigos is ready, remove the bay leaves and serve hot with sourdough bread or boiled potatoes. Bigos tastes better with time, so you can store it in the fridge for up to three days, freeze it, or store it in jars if you make a bigger batch. Reheat it gently on the stovetop or in the microwave before serving.

Calories: 702kcal

Author: Kylie Perrotti

Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot

Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil
* 3½ pounds beef short ribs bone-in
* 1 yellow onion peeled and sliced into wedges
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and crushed
* 6 cups low-sodium beef stock
* 2 tablespoons sesame oil
* 2 tablespoons tamari
* 1 tablespoon mirin
* 4 scallions trimmed and minced
* 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms sliced
* Water or stock as needed

For Serving:

* 16 ounces udon noodles cooked
* Shichimi-togarashi optional
* Soft-boiled eggs optional

InstructionsBraise the Short Ribs:

* Preheat oven to 350ºF. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Pat the short ribs dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Add them to the pot and cook without moving for 4-5 minutes per side until well-browned all over.
* Add the onions and garlic to the pot and cook for 3-4 minutes more. Pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Turn the heat off. Cover and transfer to the oven for 2-3 hours or until the short ribs are tender.

Boil the Short Ribs:

* Transfer the short ribs to the stovetop and remove the lid. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and reduce heat to medium. Low-boil the short ribs for about 30 minutes or until the broth has reduced significantly. Reduce heat to low. *At this point, you can either turn off the heat and transfer to the fridge overnight or you can continue through with the recipe without refrigerating the ribs overnight.*

Shred the Short Ribs:

* Remove the bone and gristle from each of the ribs. Using two forks, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Finish the Broth:

* Add enough water or stock to cover the shredded meat. If you'd like a more brothy udon, add more stock, but you shouldn't need to add more than 3 cups of water or stock.
* Bring the broth to a boil and add the sesame oil, tamari, and mirin. Stir in the minced scallions and sliced shiitake mushrooms. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.

Cook the Udon Noodles:

* As the broth simmers a final time, cook the udon noodles. Drain, rinse, and set aside.

To Serve:

* Divide the udon between bowls and ladle the broth on top. Pile the shredded short ribs on top and garnish as you like. Enjoy!

*Time:* 15 min prep, 15 min cook, 6+ hour marinade

*Nutrition:* \~160 cal per taco

*Makes:* 8-10 tacos

*Original Recipe:* [https://www.craftycookbook.com/tri-tip-street-tacos/](https://www.craftycookbook.com/tri-tip-street-tacos/) 

This recipe can be easily prepped in the freezer. When tri-tip is on sale I will buy 4-5 lbs and prepare freezer packs for later easy meals. It only takes about 15 minutes to prepare once the steak is marinated. Freezer instructions included below. 

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb tri-tip steaks, or similar
* ½ cup white onion diced (\~¼ large onion)
* 8-10 extra small flour or corn tortillas (I use flour)
* ¼ cup fresh cilantro
* 1 lime sliced into wedges, for serving

*For Marinade:*

* ¼ cup lime juice
* ¼ cup olive oil
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
* 2 tsp salt
* 2 tsp onion powder
* 2 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp black pepper

**Instructions**

1. Combine all ingredients of the marinade. Trim excess fat from the steaks and place in a zip bag with the marinade. Marinate in fridge for at least 6 hours before cooking (preferably overnight).
2. When ready to cook, remove the steak from the bag and discard the rest of the marinade (shake off excess but do not pat the steaks dry). Grill steak to desired doneness, or cook in a cast iron pan with a swirl of olive oil. I cook in mine in a cast iron pan over high heat, turning every few minutes, until an internal temp of 135°F, about 8-10 minutes. (Note, the marinade may cause some additional charring on the outside, but this contributes to the flavor and isn't noticeable after slicing)
3. Let the steak rest for a few minutes, then slice into small pieces as pictured. Toss the steak in the juices after cutting.
4. Warm tortillas for a few seconds in the microwave, or a pan over medium low heat. Divide the steak evenly between the tortillas, then top with onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime to taste.

**To prepare in bulk for freezer:**

1. Trim steaks and prepare appropriate quantity of marinade. Package steaks, in marinade, in a freezer safe zip bag or vacuum bag. Package size should be the quantity you will want to defrost at a time (I do 1 lb).
2. Place marinated steak packs in the freezer directly after preparing.

**To prepare from frozen:**

1. Defrost steak at least 6 hours before you plan to cook it, giving the steak time to marinate. I suggest moving from the freezer to fridge the night before.  
Follow the rest of the recipe as written, preparing the topping ingredients fresh.

**Prepare the mashed potatoes:**

1. Add the melted butter, milk, and white pepper to the potatoes and mash until smooth and creamy. Taste and season with salt.
2. Prepare the cottage pie: Grease a baking dish with butter, if needed. Pour the gravy into the baking dish and spoon or pipe the mashed potatoes on top. Smooth it out with the back of your spoon.
3. Transfer to the oven for 30 minutes.

**Broil the cottage pie, optional:**

1. Pour 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the mashed potatoes. Turn on the broiler and broil the dish until the potatoes turn golden brown on top, 2–3 minutes. Remove from the broiler and let stand for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with freshly minced parsley.

xrkixt,Beef Wellington - Gordon Ramsay style,3124,61,1664489426.0,0.94,Beef,beckythic,https://i.redd.it/wc35eny2gvq91.png,"Ingredients:

•	2 x 400g beef fillets  
•	Olive oil, for frying  
•	500g mixture of wild mushrooms, cleaned  
•	1 thyme sprig, leaves only  
•	500g puff pastry  
•	8 slices of Parma ham  
•	2 egg yolks, beaten with 1 tbsp water and a pinch of salt  
•	Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper  


Ingredients for the red wine sauce:

•	2 tbsp olive oil  
•	200g beef trimmings (ask the butcher to reserve these when trimming the fillet)  
•	4 large shallots, peeled and sliced  
•	12 black peppercorns  
•	1 bay leaf  
•	1 thyme sprig  
•	Splash of red wine vinegar  
•	1 x 750ml bottle red wine  
•	750ml beef stock  


&amp;#x200B;

Directions: (comment if you need any help)

1.	Wrap each piece of beef tightly in a triple layer of cling film to set its shape, then chill overnight.  
  
2.	Remove the cling film, then quickly sear the beef fillets in a hot pan with a little olive oil for 30-60 seconds until browned all over and rare in the middle. Remove from the pan and leave to cool.  
  
3.	Finely chop the mushrooms and fry in a hot pan with a little olive oil, the thyme leaves and some seasoning. When the mushrooms begin to release their juices, continue to cook over a high heat for about 10 minutes until all the excess moisture has evaporated and you are left with a mushroom paste (known as a duxelle). Remove the duxelle from the pan and leave to cool.  
  
4.	Cut the pastry in half, place on a lightly floured surface and roll each piece into a rectangle large enough to envelop one of the beef fillets. Chill in the refrigerator.  
  
5.	Lay a large sheet of cling film on a work surface and place 4 slices of Parma ham in the middle, overlapping them slightly, to create a square. Spread half the duxelle evenly over the ham.  
  
6.	Season the beef fillets, then place them on top of the mushroom-covered ham. Using the cling film, roll the Parma ham over the beef, then roll and tie the cling film to get a nice, evenly thick log. Repeat this step with the other beef fillet, then chill for at least 30 minutes.  
  
7.	Brush the pastry with the egg wash. Remove the cling film from the beef, then wrap the pastry around each ham-wrapped fillet. Trim the pastry and brush all over with the egg wash. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes.  
  
8.	Meanwhile, make the red wine sauce. Heat the oil in a large pan, then fry the beef trimmings for a few minutes until browned on all sides. Stir in the shallots with the peppercorns, bay and thyme and continue to cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the shallots turn golden brown.  
  
9.	Pour in the vinegar and let it bubble for a few minutes until almost dry. Now add the wine and boil until almost completely reduced. Add the stock and bring to the boil again. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 1 hour, removing any scum from the surface of the sauce, until you have the desired consistency. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve lined with muslin. Check for seasoning and set aside.  
  
10.	When you are ready to cook the beef wellingtons, score the pastry lightly and brush with the egg wash again, then bake at 200°C/Gas 6 for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and cooked. Rest for 10 minutes before carving.  
  
11.	Meanwhile, reheat the sauce. Serve the beef wellingtons sliced, with the sauce as an accompaniment.

xaizih,"Dutch meatloaf ""gehaktbrood"" - baguette with beef, bacon, tomatoes, cheese and onion",1760,65,1662794725.0,0.97,Beef,steakhouseNL,https://i.redd.it/3s5w1wqpgzm91.jpg,"**Ingredients**  


* 2 part baked baguettes
* 250 gr minced meat (beef or pork)
* Herbs for meat - to your liking
* 1 tomato
* 1 onion
* 8 slices of cheese
* 8 slices of (smoked) bacon
* Wooden toothpicks

When my mum used to make this, oh man what a party it was.

**Directions**

1. Take a part baked baguette, and cut it in two.
2. Add minced meat. 100gr should be enough for one. You can vary in herbs, beef/pork to your likings. Mum used to buy sausages, cut them open and use  that meat.
3. Add tomato slices.
4. Put top of part baked baguette on top, add onions, (smoked)bacon (katenspek) and cheese. Notice how I put the bacon and cheese in perpendicular directions. Note: I added onions-Bacon-Cheese, but to get crispier onions, do bacon-onions-cheese.
5. Put the whole thing in the oven. I usually go for 200°C (392° F), for about 15 minutes.When you remove it from the oven, cut the thing in 2 and look if the meat in the middle is completely done.

**Word of advice:** these things fill you up pretty darn good and are not the healthiest of things. So make sure you eat healthy the rest of the day hehe.Enjoy my mum's recipe.

x2lots,“Korean” Beef Recipe &amp; Freezer Guide,86,15,1661972522.0,1.0,Beef,yellowjacquet,https://i.redd.it/3yn24kl2k3l91.jpg,"# ""Korean"" Beef 

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb ground beef
* ¼ cup light brown sugar
* ¼ cup soy sauce
* 2 tsp toasted sesame oil
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 1 tsp freshly minced ginger or ginger paste, or sub ¼ tsp powdered ginger
* 1 tsp rice vinegar, optional
* MSG, optional
* 3 green onions, greens sliced thin
* red pepper flakes, optional, for topping
* sesame seeds, optional, for topping

**Instructions**

1. Mix brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, garlic, and ginger in bowl. Optionally, add a dash of MSG if desired.
2. Over medium heat, cook the beef until cooked through and no longer pink, drain the excess fat.
3. Stir in soy sauce mixture and simmer for at least 10 mins. The sauce should reduce, and the beef will darken in color.
4. Serve beef over a bed of white rice, top with green onion, red pepper flakes, and sesame seeds.

**To Freeze**

1. Allow the beef mixture to cool to room temp, then portion it out into freezer-safe containers or zip bags. Fill each container with the portion size you plan to reheat all at once (you cannot easily divide it once frozen). Freeze for up to 3 months before using.

**To Reheat from Frozen**

1. Defrost the beef by moving the container to the fridge 12-24 hours in advance, or defrost the sealed container quickly in cool water. The beef doesn’t need to be fully thawed, just enough to get it out of the container and broken up into a few chunks.
2. Warm the meat in a skillet over medium heat until fully defrosted and sizzling, then reduce the heat to low until ready to serve. Serve over a bed of white rice, top with green onion, red pepper flakes, and sesame seeds.

# Freezer Tips!

* Make 2-3 lbs at a time, and get multiple pans going! When browning beef, you want to make sure that you don’t overcrowd the pan. When I’m making jumbo batches for the freezer, I usually split the meat between my two largest skillets. Once the meat has simmered in the sauce and it’s time to serve, I’ll combine them into one pan and do a final mix to make sure the sauce and flavor is all evenly distributed.
   * My grocery store sells ground beef in 3 lb packages at a slight discount, so that’s usually what I pick up for this dish!

&amp;#x200B;

* Think about portion sizes as you package the freezer meals. How much meat do you plan to defrost at one time? Will you defrost a whole batch to feed the family, or maybe just 1 portion for you? Whatever the quantity is, make sure it’s packaged in its own bag. That will make it super easy to defrost when you want to use it. It’s difficult to separate into smaller portions once frozen.
   * My husband and I tend to eat large portions for dinner, so a 3 lb batch will be 4 total meals for us. When we prepare a 3 lb batch, we eat one portion that night, and pack the other 3 up for later.

&amp;#x200B;

* Grab bags of microwave rice for an easy meal for 1. I’m pretty picky when it comes to rice, but the microwaveable single-serve bags of rice are surprisingly good! If you plan to defrost the leftovers to prepare a meal for 1, having the instant rice on hand makes the process that much easier.

&amp;#x200B;

* Defrost portions in the fridge or in cool water. The safest way to defrost a portion is to move it into the freezer a day ahead of time, though I’ll admit that this meal is frequently a last minute decision so that method doesn’t always work for me.
   * When defrosting meats (even cooked meats) you want to make sure they don’t spend too much time in the temperature “danger zone” for bacteria growth which is 40 °F – 140 °F. You can quickly defrost meat by submerging the container in cool water, but make sure the water isn’t warm and that you pay attention so that the meat isn’t sitting out too long. You can defrost the meat completely, or just enough to get it out of the bag and broken into a few sections – it’ll finish defrosting as it’s heated in the pan (though this will take some extra time)

wfgk8f,Sliced beef tongue with pickled onion and mustard seeds,18,3,1659557127.0,0.81,Beef,gourmandiario,https://i.redd.it/63vqfscr1kf91.jpg,"**Ingredients**

For the tongue:

* 1 whole beef tongue (you can usually ask your butcher for it)
* 1 carrot
* 1 onion
* Bay leaves
* Thyme
* A couple of peppercorns

For the pickles:

* 1 white sweet onion
* Mustard seeds (dry)
* *'Hamad mraquade'* or moroccan salt-preserved lemons (optional)
* Chives
* Salt
* Sugar

**Directions**

1. **The day before** boil the beef tongue with the carrot, the onion, bay leaves, thyme, peppercorn and salt in abundant water, preferably in a pressure cooker. It should take around 50min/1 hour depending on the size of the piece and the type of pressure cooker you use. In a conventional pot it can take up to 3 hours! If the exterior skin peels easily and you can insert a knife without resistance, it's done.
2. Peel the exterior skin and firmly wrap the tongue in plastic film. Let it rest in the fridge overnight.
3. For the pickled mustard seeds, you'll want to add them to a pot with water and bring to a simmer. Discard the liquid, and repeat the process with new water. You will need to do this several times to remove the bitternes from the seeds.
4. Once you've done this 5 or 6 times (could be more, could be less, just taste the seeds), add white vinegar and water in a 50/50 proportion just to cover the seeds (which will have grown from the moisture) and two tablespoons of sugar, and bring to a simmer again. Let the liquid reduce and turn into a slightly dense mixture. You can adjust by adding more vinegar if it is too dense or too sweet. You can store in a jar in the fridge for a long time.
5. For the 'quick-pickled' onion, thinly slice the sweet onion, and mix it with lemon juice and water (50/50 proportion again), very thin slices of salt-preserved lemons, 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt. (You can add a teaspoon of MSG if you want an extra umami punch, and you can substitute the preserved lemon for normal lemon peel).
6. Take the tongue out from the fridge. It should be rigid from the collagen getting cold, but its the perfect state for slicing it. Either use an electric slicer or a good knife, the tongue should be very tender if the cooking time is correct.
7. Serve the tongue slices with the onion and mustard seeds on top, add a bit of the onion pickle juice to season the meat, and decorate with chives.

Many people feel disgusted from the idea of eating tongue but its an extremely soft and flavorful cut, similar to beef cheeks, and an excellent way to respect the meat and get the most out of the animal.

vqedgc,Beef Madras Curry,125,5,1656843009.0,0.96,Beef,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/9rmv99fcvb991.jpg,"Who doesn't like super tender beef in rich tomato-based curry sauce? It melts in the mouth and is super easy to prepare! I have separated the process of cooking as most online recipes call for, this gives more control over meat tenderness and the right consistency of the sauce, just like in the restaurant setting, bringing the best quality to your home cooking :)

**Ingredients for Marinade:**

\* 500g (1.1Pound) Beef chuck steak diced to 2,5cm cubes (you can use any braising cut if chuck is not available)

\* 1tbsp of ginger &amp; garlic paste

\* 1tbsp vegetable oil

\* 1tsp of salt

\* 1 lemon juice

\* 3tbsp of Madras spice blend

**Ingredients for Madras Spice Blend:**

\* 3tbsp ground coriander

\* 3tbsp ground cumin

\* 2tbsp ground turmeric

\* 2tbsp chilli powder (adjust to your preference)

\* 2tbsp garam masala

\* 1tsp black pepper

**Ingredients for the Curry:**

\* 500g of marinated Beef

\* enough water to cover the meat during slow-cooking

\* 2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil

\* 1 large onion, small dice

\* 1tbsp of garlic &amp; ginger paste

\* 3tbsp of Madras spice blend

\* 400ml of vegetable stock

\* 4tbsp of tomato puree

\* juice of a half lemon

\* 1tsp of sugar

\* 1 beef stock cube

\* a handful of fresh coriander leaves and seeds

\* papadam to serve

**Instructions:**

1. Prepare the Madras spice blend by mixing the ingredients. It will make more than you need for the recipe (you can always add more at the end of cooking to boost the flavour)
2. Place the beef in the bowl and marinate by mixing all the ingredients from the list with the meat. Place in the fridge overnight.
3. On the following day, sear the beef in a frying pan over high heat and transfer it to a slow-cooker or a pot (do not over-fry it as it will make your meat dry, you want a nice caramelization on one side of each piece) Add enough hot water to cover the meat and cook covered on low until tender. This can take 2-3 hours depending on the cut used (a slow-cooker can take longer).
4. In the meantime prepare the sauce. In a medium-sized pan heat 2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil, add diced onion and fry over medium heat until soft and browned.
5. Add 1tbsp of garlic ginger paste, 3tbsp of Madras spice blend and cook until fragrant.
6. Add vegetable stock, tomato puree, beef stock cube, 1tsp of sugar and lemon juice. Mix together and bring to a boil. Blend sauce and adjust seasoning to your preference, remove from the heat until needed.
7. Once the beef is tender and connective tissue has turned into jelly, separate it from the liquid. Add beef to the sauce plus a little bit of the cooking stock.
8. Continue cooking on low heat until the thick consistency of the sauce is reached.
9. Serve Beef Madras with fresh coriander seeds and leaves. Crunch with papadam, cucumber raita and onion salad. Enjoy!

**Insight:**

\- The slow cooker's low setting is approximately 90C (194F). A high setting brings the cooking temperature to around 100C (212F).

\- Collagen - connective tissue in the meat begins to dissolve into gelatin at a temperature of 70C (160F). Lower cooking temperatures and longer time result in a juicer and tenderer meat.

* 1 pound loose hot Italian sausage
* 1 pound ground beef
* 2 teaspoons neutral oil if needed
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 2 carrots peeled and small-diced

* Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 3–4 hours or until the short ribs can be shredded easily with a fork.

## Shred the short ribs:

* Remove the ragu from the heat and carefully remove the lid. Shred the beef and mash any remaining whole-peeled tomatoes. Turn the heat to medium-high and let the ragu low-boil uncovered, for 15–20 minutes. If the liquid evaporates too quickly, add beef stock in ¼ cup increments. Taste and season the sauce.

## Cook the pasta:

* Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the pasta.

## Coat the pasta:

# Ingredients

BEEF &amp; MARINADE:

* 1 lb beef sirloin/ribeye/tenderloin (thinly sliced)
* 1 tsp cornstarch
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp Shaoxing wine (sub dry sherry)

SAUCE:

* 1 tbsp light soy sauce (low sodium)
* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce
* 2 tsp oyster sauce
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1/4 tsp sesame oil
* White pepper powder to taste

REST OF THE DISH:

* 1 tbsp neutral oil
* ½ large white onion sliced
* 3 cloves garlic
* 2 stalks scallion

# Instructions

1. If not yet sliced, thinly slice your cut of meat so they are bite-sized pieces.
2. Marinade the beef in soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, and cornstarch. Toss to evenly coat and let sit for at least 15 minutes.
3. Heat up oil in a pan on medium heat and stir-fry beef until brown, but not fully cooked. Remove from pan and set aside in a separate bowl.
4. Cook down the onions in the same pan on medium heat. Be patient as we want the onions to get soft so this could take up to 10 minutes.
5. When onions are soft, add the cooked beef back in the pan. Add in the sauce mixture.
6. Continue to stir-fry until beef is completely cooked, about another 3-4 minutes.
7. Add in the chopped scallions and give it one last toss. Serve with a bowl of rice.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ppgkn0/beef_onion_stirfry/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ppgkn0/beef_onion_stirfry/
pjlsnt,Russian Steak Gravy AKA Beef Stroganoff,63,3,1631016596.0,0.97,Beef,unitedcuisines,https://i.redd.it/vo3b3dfkh2m71.jpg,"Beef Stroganoff: tasty, creamy and very comforting! Also rather easy-to-make and takes less than 20 minutes to prep.

You can have it with pasta, mashed potatoes, polenta or even fries. No matter what you serve your Beef Stroganoff with, enjoy!

INGREDIENTS:

\- good quality, not too tough cut of beef, such as sirloin or rib-eye \[10 oz / 300 g\]

\- vegetable oil \[1 tbsp / 15 ml\]

\- butter \[1 tbsp / 15 g\]

\- half an onion

\- button or cremini mushrooms \[4 oz / 120 g\]

\- 1 big garlic clove

\- all purpose flour \[1 tbsp\]

\- beef broth \[1 cup / 250 ml\]

\- crème fraîche \[1/3 cup / 80 g\]

\- Dijon mustard \[2 tsp / 10 g\]

\- a handful of chopped chives

Servings: 2

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Cut the beef into small stripes of approximately 8mm or 1/3inch in thickness and 3-4 cm, or 1-1.5inch in lenth. Maybe a bit shorter, if you re cooking for children. Slice the mushrooms and roughly chop the onion, too
2. Over high heat, sprinkle half a tablespoon of vegetable oil into your pan, which should preferably be NOT non-stick, to better sear the meat. Once the pan is really hot, season your meat with salt and pepper and immediately transfer into the pan. DON'T overcrowd the pan and fry stripes for 30-45 seconds. Quickly turn once browned and sear from other side for another 30-45 seconds and set aside on a plate
3. Once you seared your meat, reduce the heat to medium, and, into the same pan, add a tablespoon of butter and sauté the mushrooms and onion in it for approximately 5 minutes
4. When the mushrooms start to nicely brown, crush in a big garlic clove into the mix and fry together for one minute, or till fragrant
5. Sprinkle a tablespoon of all purpose flour on top, stir constantly and toast the flour for a minute, before deglazing everything with a cup of beef broth
6. Add the crème fraîche, as well as mustard and mix well. Bring to a slight boil, reduce the heat of the pan to low and let simmer for 5-10 minutes, till the sauce reduces to the consistency of your choice
7. When your gravy's texture is almost right, season it with salt and pepper to taste and bring back the meat and mix it into the gravy. Turn off the heat after a minute, sprinkle a tablespoon of finely chopped chives on your beef Stroganoff and that's it! NOTE: If you got a good, rather tender cut, you don't need to and shouldn't cook the meat in the gravy anymore, for it will overcook and get tough. Whereas, when you get a rather tough cut such as Chuck, you will need to cook it in the gravy for 1-1.5hours

For the beef:

500g / ~1lb of beef (flank)

A bowl full of cornstarch

Salt / pepper


The sauce:

3 Tbsp Soy Sauce (any kind)

3 tbsp of broth (any kind)

2 tbsp of hoisin sauce or any other asian sticky sauce you have at hand

1 tbsp of brown sugar or sugar

A spoonful of grated ginger

4 minced cloves of garlic

1 spring onion

1 red bell pepper

_____________

Instructions:

1. marinate the sliced flank for 24h in an acidic marinade (I just used soy sauce)

2. Coat the beef slices in the seasoned (just a little salt and pepper added) cornstarch and shallow fry them in a pan.

3. When they're deep brown and crispy, take them out to dry on a rack. Then prepare the sauce.

4. Add all liquid ingredients to the sugar and thoroughly mix, then set aside. 

5. Cut the vegetables (bell pepper and spring onion) preferably thinly julienned. 

6. To a hot pan, add some sesame oil or normal vegetable oil (I used vegetable oil but that's just because I'm a broke student heh), add the minced garlic and the ginger, shortly followed by the pepper and spring onion.

7. After a few minutes it should smell really aromatic, that's when you add in your fried beef slices. Let them soak in the garlicy-gingery flavor for a minute or two and dump in your liquid mix. 

8. After stirring a bit the sauce should thicken slightly, that's when you can pour your beef over a prepared bowl of rice and enjoy.

### INGREDIENTS

* **6-7lb** Standing prime rib roast, bones detached but strung to the roast
* **3 tbsp** Olive oil
* **2 tbsp** Salt
* **1 tbsp** Black pepper
* **2 tbsp** Italian seasoning
* **1 tsp** Rosemary
* **1 tbsp** Onion powder
* **1 tbsp** Garlic powder
* **2 tsp** Worcestershire sauce
* **15** Garlic cloves, peeled and halved long-ways

### STEPS

1. Pre-heat oven to 500F
2. Place roast, bones down, in a roasting pan
3. Using a small sharp knife, poke holes all over the roast 2-3 inches deep
4. Stuff garlic clove pieces into each hole
5. In a small mixing bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients and seasonings, mix well. It should be a bit paste-like
6. Rub the seasoning mixture all over the roast, coating at least the top and sides.
7. Place the roast in the oven and cook at 500F for the first 20 minutes. Careful that things don't get too smokey
8. Turn the oven down to 325F and cook for 13-14 mins per pound for rare. *Use a meat thermometer* to ensure you're not overcooking. You can always cook it more or heat a given piece to a higher temperature, but it's *way* too nice of a cut to accidentally ruin. I like to pull mine out when the thickest part is at 115F, and let it cook a bit more while resting.
9. Let the roast rest in the pan for 10-15 minutes before carving.
10. Slice into 3/4-inch thick slices, and plate.
11. (Optional) Combine the drippings from the roasting pan with a can of au jus, or salted beef broth and serve that along side the sliced roast. You may also want to add a little worcestershire and soy sauce as well.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/mgidvy/worlds_best_prime_rib_roast/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/mgidvy/worlds_best_prime_rib_roast/

This was a really delicious, easy recipe. I might get hate for using salsa, but it's a really easy way to load your beef up with flavor with not too much effort. You can use any brand of taquera salsa (which is a taqueria style salsa...)

**Ingredients:**

Stewed Beef

* 2-3 pound chuck roast
* 1 tablespoon avocado oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced into wedges
* 1/2 cup beef stock
* 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
* 10 ounce jar salsa taquera
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 teaspoon brown sugar, more if you like a sweeter heat
* Salt and pepper to taste

Cheesy Grits:

* 2 cups water
* 1 cup corn grits
* 1 cup whole milk
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1/2 cup sharp cheddar
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* Salt and pepper to taste

For Serving:

* Minced scallions
* Jalapenos en escabeche (aka pickled jalapenos)

**Method:**

1. Cook the chuck: Preheat oven to 350ºF. Pat the chuck dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Cut the steak into thirds.
2. Heat the avocado oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the chuck and cook the steak pieces for 4-5 minutes per side until browned all over.
3. Add the onion the skillet around the steak and continue cooking until the onion softens and begins to turn light golden brown, an additional 5-6 minutes.
4. Pour in the beef stock and bring to a boil. Add the whole peeled tomatoes, salsa taquera, crushed red pepper, salt, pepper, and brown sugar. Bring to a boil and then turn off the heat.
5. Cover the beef and transfer to the oven for 3 hours.
6. Remove the pot from the oven and taste. Turn the oven to 275ºF.
7. Season again to taste with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, and more sugar, if you like. Return to the oven, uncovered, for 1 hour until the beef is completely falling apart. Add more liquid, as necessary, if the beef liquid evaporates too quickly.
8. Shred the beef and keep warm.
9. Prepare the cheese grits: Bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Stir in the grits and salt and reduce heat. Stir in the milk. Simmer, stirring often, for 20 minutes until thickened and tender. Stir in the butter, cheddar cheese, paprika, salt, and pepper. Turn off the heat and allow the grits to rest for 5 minutes.
10. To serve: Divide the cooked grits between plates and pile the beef on top. Garnish with pickled jalapeños and minced scallions.

During our stay in the small village of Saint-Martin-de-Bavel, we visited the local restaurant for the dinner and one of the dishes that I tried was Beef Bourguignon over boiled potatoes. I loved the simplicity of the dish and the complexity of the flavour that comes with it. I asked about a few tips of cooking this dish and their secret was to marinate the beef overnight. Back home I tried to recreate this dish and this is the recipe I want to share with you.

This recipe makes 4 portions

Marinating time: 1 day

Cooking time 3,5 hours

**Ingredients for marinade:**

* 500g Diced Beef chuck or other stewing cut
* half bottle of Burgundy red wine (if not available you can use other red wine too)
* 1 banana shallot finely diced
* bunch of fresh thyme, chopped
* 2 bay leaves
* 1/2tsp of black pepper

**Ingredients for stew:**

* 100g of lardons
* 200g button mushrooms cut in half
* 15 pearl onions
* 2 medium carrots cut to half rings
* half a stick of celery, finely diced
* 4 garlic cloves
* 25g of butter
* 300ml of beef stock
* extra hot water to be added during cooking (to compensate liquid evaporation)
* 1tbsp of cornflour dissolved in 2tbsp of water
* 1tbsp oil
* Parsley to garnish
* Boiled potatoes or pasta to serve

📷📷

**Instructions:**

1. Begin by marinating diced beef. Mix it in a bowl with finely diced shallot, a small bunch of fresh chopped thyme, 2 bay leaves, 1/2tsp of black pepper and half a bottle of Burgundy red wine. Leave it covered in the fridge overnight.
2. On the next day, remove the beef pieces from the marinade and pat them dry ready to be seared **(keep the marinade).**
3. To sear the beef mix it with 1tbsp of oil and pan-fry over high heat to colour the meat on each side (do it in two batches if your pan is small or you preparing a bigger amount).
4. Add in the marinade liquid with all the bits plus 300ml of beef stock, bring it to the temperature and **simmer for 2,5 hours** (during that time the liquid will evaporate so keep adding more water to keep the meat almost covered).
5. In the meantime prepare bacon and vegetables. In a separate pan, fry bacon lardons until the fat have rendered out, then add the mushrooms and fry until they start to brown. Next, add pearl onions with 25g of butter. Once melted add carrots and celery. Once browned transfer everything onto a plate ready for later.
6. **After 2,5 hours** beef will start to tenderise, at this point add bacon with vegetables and simmer for **1 more hour** (**during that time the liquid should reduce by half**).
7. Once Beef Bourguignon is ready you can thicken the sauce if needed with 1tbsp of cornflour dissolved in 2tbsp of water. Don't forget to check and adjust the seasoning.
8. Serve over buttery boiled potatoes or pasta.

Oxtails are stick-to-your-stomach rich and indulgent, and to me, there's no better way to eat them than in a luxurious, melt-in-your-mouth stew! I grew up eating my grandma's Chinese version, and it's truly one of the easiest yet richest meals you could enjoy: it's fragrant from spices like star anise, cloves, and ginger, and has meat that's fall-off-the-bone tender, and what may be the best thing about this version is that it's quick and easy to make in an Instant Pot! While this stew could take 3-5 hours with constant nursing on the stove, the Instant Pot allows you to pressure cook this comforting Chinese stew in just 45 min!

**Chinese Oxtail Stew recipe**  
*Ingredients:* 

* 1 Tbsp neutral oil 
* 3.5-4 lb oxtails, trimmed and de-fatted

*Directions:* 

1. Turn Instant Pot on ""saute"" mode and add 1 Tbsp oil to the pot. Allow to heat up. Then, add oxtails in groups so that you brown \*all\* sides of the oxtails. More browning = more flavor! 
2. Once all oxtails are browned on all sides, turn ""saute"" mode off and pour out any excess oil from the pot. Turn ""saute"" mode on again, and add the cloves, star anise, bay leaves, ginger, and garlic cloves. Saute until the spices are fragrant and the garlic/ginger have browned a bit. 
3. Add in remaining ingredients (sugar, soy sauces, wine, and water) to the pot. Stir to combine. Then, add in all the browned oxtails. Turn saute mode off. 
4. Put lid on Instant Pot, switch to High Pressure mode,  and set timer for 45 min to pressure cook. Make sure the knob is set to ""sealing."" 
5. Once 45 min is up, allow pot to naturally release, then open the pot. Switch the mode to ""saute"" and allow the oxtail sauce to reduce until it can coat the back of a spoon.

Calories: 667kcal

Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot

Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 2½ pounds mushrooms, sliced I used a blend of baby bella and white mushrooms
* 2 yellow onions peeled and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 5 tablespoons butter divided
* 1½ pounds skirt steak sliced against the grain into thin strips; or use ribeye, filet mignon tips, or top sirloin
* ½ teaspoon nutmeg
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper
* ½ teaspoon dry thyme
* 3 cups beef stock divided
* ¼ cup flour
* 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* ½ cup fresh parsley minced; divided
* ¼ cup sour cream
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 16 ounces egg noodles

InstructionsCook the Mushrooms:

* Heat the oil in a wide, deep pot over medium-high. Once hot, add half the mushrooms and cook for 8-10 minutes until well-browned. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl. Cook the remaining mushrooms until well-browned and transfer to the same bowl.

Cook the Mushrooms:

* If the pot is too dry, add another teaspoon or two of oil and add the onions. Cook for 10-15 minutes until they begin to soften significantly and turn golden brown. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent them from burning. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the bowl of mushrooms.

Cook the Beef:

* Season the sliced beef with salt and pepper and pat dry. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter into the pot and add the beef in batches. Cook without moving until well-browned and no longer pink.
* Add the nutmeg, crushed red pepper, and thyme to the pot and cook for 30-45 seconds until fragrant.
* Add the mushrooms and onions and toss to combine everything. Turn the heat to high. Once the pot is sizzling, add ½ cup beef stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Prepare the Gravy:

* Warm the remaining beef stock in the microwave. Whisk the flour into the warm stock and add the Worcestershire sauce.
* Pour the mixture into the pot and bring to a low boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes. Season again with salt and pepper.

Cook the Noodles:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the egg noodles according to package instructions. Drain and return the pot to the stove.
* Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the pot. Add the egg noodles and half the minced parsley and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

Finish the Beef Stroganoff:

* Scoop out ½ cup of the gravy from the beef stroganoff. Stir in the sour cream and whisk until smooth. The sour cream should be warmed through. Pour the mixture into the pot of beef and stir to combine.
* Add the remaining minced parsley to the beef stroganoff and turn off the heat.

To Serve:

* Divide the buttered noodles between bowls and pile the beef stroganoff on top. Garnish with more parsley, if desired. Enjoy!

Served with Polish potato dumplings and baby gherkins.

Adding egg to Silesian dumplings depends on the variety of potatoes used, their dryness and the temperature of the mashed potatoes. Some recipes don't use it at all.

Originally posted [here](https://www.insightflavour.com/post/slow-cooked-beef-stroganoff-with-silesian-dumplings-gherkins)

&amp;#x200B;

Serves 4

**Ingredients for the dumplings:**

* This version of Beef Stroganoff is lighter on the wallet yet full of flavours thanks to slow cooking. Served with Polish potato dumplings and baby gherkins.
* 250g (8.8oz) of potato starch or cornflour
* 13g (0.46oz) of salt
* 1-2 eggs (depending on the moisture of the dough)
* 1tbsp of butter for coating once cooked

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for the Beef stroganoff:**

* 600g (1.3 Pounds) of diced beef (leaner cuts will be ready in 3 hours, ones with more connective tissue may require 6 hours of slow-cooking)
* 2 small onions diced
* 4 garlic cloves slightly crushed
* 800ml (0.84quarts) of beef stock
* 1 large carrot diced (120g (4.2oz))
* 2 bay leaves
* 3 allspice berries
* 300g (10.6oz) of white mushrooms cut in quarters
* 100ml (0.1quarts) of double cream
* 1tbsp of yoghurt/thick sour cream (optional)
* 10g (0.35oz) of dill
* 1tsp sugar
* salt and black pepper to liking
* 10 baby gherkins
* rapeseeds oil
* 1tbsp plain flour
* 1,5tbsp butter

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** Heat the frying pan to moderate heat with a little bit of oil and sear of the diced beef in **2-3 batches** to improve its flavour. When done transfer to the medium-sized pot or slow-cooker.

**2.** Use the same frying pan to sweat the onions and garlic, add **2tbsp of oil** and reduce the heat to medium. After **5 minutes** transfer to the master pot.

**3.** Add **800ml** of beef stock, allspice and bay leaves then bring to a boil and reduce to simmer, when using slow-cooker set it on high (I used a leaner cut that was ready in **3 hours**, others may need up to **6 hours**). In the meantime jump to dumplings.

**4.** When the meat is almost ready, add diced carrots and continue cooking for another **30 minutes**.

**5.** Once the meat is tender, saute diced mushrooms to brown all around and season with salt when almost ready, add to the master pot along with the cream.

**6.** Use the same frying pan to melt **1,5tbsp** of butter then add **1tbsp** of plain flour, once combined, cook on medium heat for around a minute then stir into the master pot to thicken the sauce.

**7.** Finish the sauce by adding fresh chopped dill and **1tbsp** of yoghurt, balance the flavour by adding **1tsp** of sugar and salt and black pepper to your liking.

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions for the dumplings:**

**1.** Begin by boiling potatoes in salty water until ready for mashing.

**2.** Mash potatoes until smooth, I recommend using a potato ricer as this has a direct impact on the texture of your dumplings.

**3.** Once the dough is combined divide it into two parts and roll each part on the surface with your hands into the size of a rolling pin 

**4.** After **30min - 1hours** potatoes should be ready to work with, place them together in a bowl and add **250g** of potato flour/starch and **2** eggs. Mix together with a spoon and transfer to the worktop to continue kneading by hand.

**5.** Once the dough is combined divide it into two parts and roll each part on the surface with hands into the size of a rolling pin **(5cm diameter (2inch)**.

**6.** Slice the logs to equal rings **1,5cm (0,6inch)** in thickness. Roll each piece in hands to a ball shape then make a dip with your knuckle. Place each dumpling on a cloth ready for boiling.

**7.** To boil dumplings use a pot of slightly salty water, once you add them in, give it a stir and wait until they float to the top, from that moment begin the count to **3-4 minutes** and remove them from the water on to a plate, add butter to coat and serve with the sauce garnished with fresh dill and gherkins.

&amp;#x200B;

**Insight:**

* Adding egg to Silesian dumplings depends on the variety of potatoes used, their dryness and temperature of the mashed potatoes. Some recipes don't use it at all.
* Beef Stroganoff originated in Russia and spread quickly throughout the world, bringing additional ingredients like mushrooms, mustard or tomatoes.
* In Poland, gherkins are served with the dish or added to it in the last stages of cooking.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kdjtnv/slowcooked_beef_stroganoff_with_silesian/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kdjtnv/slowcooked_beef_stroganoff_with_silesian/

* 1 pound flank or skirt steak, thinly sliced against grain
* 4 cups small broccoli florets (about 1 head
* 1 1/2 cups jasmine or white rice
* 1 chopped green onion
* 1–2 tablespoons canola/vegetable
* 1 tablespoon sesame seeds for garnish
* ground pepper, to taste

**Sauce**

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl starting with the water and sugar first. Whisk to combine. Set aside. Sauce can be made ahead and stored in the fridge.
2. Thinly slice flank steak into 1/4 inch thick strips **against** the grain. **This part is very important for tenderness. Cut strips into 2-inch bite-sized pieces.**
3. Cook rice according to the directions on the package.
4. Meanwhile, bring skillet to medium heat. Add 1/2 cup water and broccoli. Cook broccoli, tossing occasionally until just starting to tenderize, about 5 minutes.

5. Transfer broccoli to a bowl and add oil to the skillet. Add steak in a single layer and season liberally with pepper. Cook for about 1-2 minutes per side or until no longer pink.
6. Add sauce to the skillet and bring to a simmer. As soon as it bubbles, reduce heat to low and let thicken, about 1-2 minutes. Add broccoli and toss with the steak until everything is coated. if sauce gets too thick add a little warm water. Top with green onion and sesame seeds. Serve over white rice.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

150g fresh, good quality beef for tartare (ask your butcher what they recommend)

2 eggs (1 at room temperature, for the mayo)

3-4 tbsp soy sauce

1/2 carrot

Small bunch of chives

Mustard 1 tsp: you'll need half for the mayo and half for the vinaigrette

Hazelnut oil, about 1-2 tbsp

1 orange: half of it zested, and 1/4 juiced

Vegetable oil, about 300g (but more if you like your mayo thicker)

1 tsp brined peppercorns

\[+ a few slices of toasted sourdough\]

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

1. To make the cured yolk, crack the egg open, remove the yolk and add it to the soy sauce. Leave it to cure in the soy sauce until you plate up.
2. Now, off to the mayo. The quickest and easiest way to make mayo is with a hand blender. Add the whole egg (at room temperature) to a bowl, add salt, oil, the chives and half of the mustard.
3. Blend, slowly, from the bottom to the top, until emulsified. If it's not thick enough, add more oil and repeat the process. It takes one or two minutes. So, so easy!
4. Peel the carrot, then dice it into tiny little cubes, a.k.a. brunoise.
5. Add the carrot to a mixing bowl.
6. Dice the meat. I don't know how you like your beef tartare, but I like mine to still have a bite. My butcher asked me if I wanted it minced, that's a no go for me. This is also why I like to freeze it some 20-30 minutes before I cut it. That helps me cut it into nice and evenly. Try that!
7. Add the beef to the bowl with the carrots.
8. Zest the orange. As much as you like. I adore zest, so I always add a lot.
9. For the vinaigrette: add some hazelnut oil to a small jar, squeeze some orange juice, season, add the remaining mustard and shake. Mustard is a surfactant, meaning that it helps molecules of fat and water bind - i.e., it emulsifies the vinaigrette.
10. Add it to the beef and carrot, and mix well.
11. Plate up and enjoy with a few slices of toasted sourdough.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/jvb9ue/hazelnut_beef_tartare_carrot_chive_mayo_soy_cured/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/jvb9ue/hazelnut_beef_tartare_carrot_chive_mayo_soy_cured/

jem3j5,Homemade Hot Dry Noodles,2369,34,1603185998.0,0.99,Beef,mienczaczek,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/jem3j5,"Reganmian is a traditional Chinese dish where noodles are served with flavourful beef stock - lou mei and other garnishes like crushed peanuts, pickled carrots or beans, sesame sauce, soy sauce, fresh garlic, chilli oil, coriander and scallions.

Noodles are the main element of this dish so making fresh is the best way to go. My favourite is Udon, easy to make and tastes fantastic, I bet you will enjoy it as much as I did at the moment when everything mixes together and you take the first bite.

You don't have to add all of the toppings to make it delicious. Instead of chilli oil, I used my homemade chilli sauce and it worked great. I also pickled carrot with my quick hot pickle.

**Ingredients for Udon:**

* 500g (17.6oz) of plain flour
* 250g (8.8oz) of warm water
* 20g (0.7oz) of salt
* cornstarch for dusting

**Ingredients for lou mei:**

* 400ml (0.42quarts) of beef or stock
* 3tbsp sesame oil
* 20g (0.7oz) of fresh ginger peeled and sliced
* 3 garlic cloves peeled and sliced
* 1 small shallot sliced
* 1spring onion sliced
* 3tbsp Shaoxing wine
* 1tbsp brown sugar

**Spices for lou mei:**

* 2 small cinnamon sticks
* 3 bay leaves
* 10 peppercorns
* 20 fennel seeds
* 10 cloves
* 5 cardamon pods
* 3 star anise

📷📷

**Instructions for Noodles (4 portions) :**

**1.** Dissolve the salt in warm water and mix into the flour, knead for **8 minutes** until a smooth dough ball is formed (it may be hard at the beginning but it will soften as gluten forms) Then rest it covered to prevent drying for **30 minutes**.

📷📷

**2.** After resting it is time for final kneading and the easiest way to get it done is by placing the dough in a plastic bag and stepping on it until it spreads out then folding it into a ball again and repeating this two more times. You can also roll it with a pin but it is a lot harder to do so. After you finish rest the dough for at least **2 hours or overnight**.

**3.** Roll the dough flat to **1/4 of an inch** then fold it on itself and slice equal noodles.

**4.** Boil the noodles in salty water for **12 minutes** (do it in 3 batches) then run them  under cold water to set the starch on the outer surface (this makes them silkier and prevents from sticking)

**5.** To serve the noodles, deep them in boiling water for **15 seconds** then place in the bowl, add a small ladle of lou mei and garnish with other toppings.

**Instructions for Lou mei:**

**1.** Heat **3tbsp of sesame oil** in a medium pan then add, garlic, ginger and onion. Fry for couple minutes then add seven spices, fry for another couple minutes to release the aroma.

**2.** Add Shaoxing wine, beef stock and brown sugar then simmer for about **30-60 minutes.**

**3.** Once ready you can store in the fridge for up to 4 days.

 **Quick Pickled Carrot:**

* 100g (3.5oz) carrot, peeled and chopped into matchsticks
* 100ml (0.1quarts) of red wine vinegar
* 50g (1.8oz) of brown sugar

Combine vinegar and sugar then bring to boil and remove from the heat, add carrot matchsticks and make sure it is submerged. After 15 minutes the pickle is ready, you can store it in the fridge for future use.

📷📷  
**Homemade Chilli sauce:**

* 5 chillis (green or red) seeds removed
* 20g (0.7oz) of ginger, peeled and diced
* 8tbsp of chopped tomato
* 1/2 lime juice
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 4tbsp rapeseed oil

Blend everything together in a food processor, it makes more than you need for this recipe so you can store it for the future in the fridge.

Insight:

* Meat surface browning intensifies the flavour thanks to Millard reactions. In the process, carbohydrates react with amino acids creating hundreds of delicious compounds.
* At a temperature of 70C (158F) connective tissue collagen begins to dissolve into gelatin making meat significantly more tender.

Author: Kylie Perrotti

### Equipment

* Wide braising pot or soup pot
* Food processor

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil
* 2 pounds chuck roast cut into cubes
* 4 celery stalks a few leaves reserved for garnish
* 2 medium onions peeled
* 2 tablespoons harissa paste
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1/4 cup flour
* 4 large carrots trimmed, scrubbed and cut into thirds
* 3-4 cups beef stock
* 1 28- ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes
* 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* Cayenne powder to taste
* ½ teaspoon celery salt
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Heavy cream optional, for serving
* Olive oil for browning the beef

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Aromatics:

* Add the onion and celery stalks (with leaves) to a food processor and pulse until roughly chopped. Remove some additional celery leaves from the stalk and mince and reserve for garnish. 

#### Brown the beef:

* Pat the beef dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed soup pot or braising pan. Once very hot, brown the beef in batches. Cook the beef cubes for 3-5 minutes on each side until well browned and crisping up around the edges. *Note: If there seems to be a lot of excess oil in the pot, you can drain it off, but don’t remove anything stuck to the bottom of the skillet.*

#### Start the Stew:

* Add the celery and onions to the hot pot and cook for 5 minutes or until softened. Add the harissa paste and tomato paste and cook for 3-5 minutes or until the paste starts to turn a deeper red color. Add the flour and stir to coat everything in the pot and cook for 1 minute more.
* Add the beef stock and reduce heat to medium low and whisk continuously until the flour is completely incorporated into the liquid and the broth is smooth. Add the can of tomatoes and their liquid.
* Add the cumin, paprika, ground ginger, garlic powder, cayenne powder to taste and celery salt. Season with salt and pepper.
* Carefully add the beef and the carrots and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and cook for at least 1 hour 30 minutes, stirring occasionally throughout cooking.

#### Finish the Stew:

* Taste the stew and season to your liking. Use a spoon to lightly mash some of the tomatoes to break them up a bit.

#### Shred the Beef:

* Remove the beef cubes from the pot and transfer to a bowl and lightly shred the meat and return it back to the pot. *Note: You do not have to completely shred the beef; simply break apart some of the cubes. You will want a mix of some shredded and some cubed beef throughout the stew.*

#### To Serve:

* Ladle a few spoonfuls of the stew between bowls. Sprinkle a few minced celery leaves on top and drizzle with heavy cream, if desired. Enjoy!

in3l5n,Korean Braised Beef Short Ribs (Galbijjim) with Rice and Kimchi,59,3,1599321689.0,0.91,Beef,poor_coIIege_student,https://i.redd.it/bqiwnnsyqcl51.jpg,"Recipe from [https://www.theminichef.com/galbijjim/](https://www.theminichef.com/galbijjim/)

INGREDIENTS

**Broth**

* 3 pounds short ribs (bone in, cut into approx. 2-3 inch long pieces)
* 1/2 white onion
* 3 slices ginger
* 4 cloves garlic (crushed)
* 6 cups water

**Braising Sauce**

* 3/4 apple (grated; or 1/2 Korean pear)
* 1/2 white onion (grated)
* 1 teaspoon ginger (grated)
* 1/3 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup mirin
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 2 cloves garlic (minced)
* Freshly ground black pepper

**Vegetables**

* 1 potato
* 1 small Korean radish (or Daikon radish)
* 1 large carrot
* 2 scallions (for garnish)

DIRECTIONS

* Trim excess fat off of the meat. In a large bowl, place the short ribs and fill with cold water to draw out excess blood from the meat. Let sit for about 30 minutes, switching the water every 10 minutes
* In a large pot, add onion, garlic, ginger, and water, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the short ribs and boil for 10 minutes, skimming off any foam that forms on the surface
* Remove ribs from broth and set aside. Pour the broth through a strainer into a bowl to remove the solids. Place the broth into the refrigerator for 30 minutes to let the fat rise to the surface
* In the meantime, prepare the braising sauce. Start by grating the apple, onion, and ginger into a bowl, then add the remaining sauce ingredients and mix well until the sugar fully dissolves
* After the broth has been in the fridge for 30 minutes, you should see a layer of fat starting to form on the surface. Do your best and use a spoon to skim off this layer of fat. (Alternatively, you can pause at this step and leave the broth overnight in the fridge. This will ensure that the fat solidifies in a layer at the top of the broth, making it extremely easy to remove)
* Place the ribs and braising liquid back into the large pot and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, flipping the ribs a few times
* Pour the broth in and cover the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 45 minutes
* In the meantime, prepare the vegetables. Cut the potato, radish, and carrots into 1 inch pieces
* After 45 minutes, add the prepared radish and carrots to the pot. Make sure that they are mostly submerged in the liquid. After cooking for another 10 minutes, add the potatoes. Cook covered for another 20 minutes
* At this point, the rib meat should be extremely tender. You’ll know it’s ready when you can easily pierce the meat with a chopstick. If you want the meat to be more tender, keep cooking covered until it reaches the desired tenderness
* Remove the lid and raise the heat back to medium. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the sauce has reduced and thickened to your liking. Remove from pot and serve immediately.

* Chef knife
* Large, heavy bottomed skillet
* Empty stomach

**INGREDIENTS** 

* 1 ribeye (shoot for a thick 1"" — 1.25"")
* 4 slices of cheese (I use Muenster)
* Kewpie Mayo (This can be bought off Amazon if you don’t have a local Asian market)
* 1 medium onion
* 4 slices sourdough
* Handful of mushrooms (optional — I use button baby bellas)
* Coarse salt and fresh pepper
* Neutral oil of choice (I like grapeseed)

**Instructions**

* Slice onions into 1/4 to 1/8 inch slices. 
* Slice mushrooms to preferred width (if you really want to feel them in your bite, I’d cut your buttons into thirds).
* Cook off mushrooms in a little oil and salt to 1/3 of original size — set aside.
* Set the steak on its side, fat cap up, and plit in half length wise. Snip cap in two places on each steak.
* Pat dry with paper towel, salt one side, sear (salt side down)
* Flip steaks, crack pepper, sear for two more minutes
* Add onions to pan around the steaks, salt/oil onions
* After searing steaks, toss onions in the pan sauce and cook steaks for 2 more minutes on top of onions
* Set steaks aside, finish onions, toss in your mushrooms (use tongs to remove to keep juices and grease in the pan). You want to let the steaks rest in the bowl that you will be putting your onions in after they’re done. 
* Swipe bread through grease and toast one side
* Prep cheese with mayo - set them on the cutting board with enough overlap to cover the whole piece of bread. Liberally add mayo edge to edge. 
* Add more oil to the pan, flip bread and drag through oil with tongs; immediately lay mayo side of cheese on bread
* Slice steaks against the grain
* Place steaks on top of un-cheesed bread; top with onions, mushrooms. 
* There should be a good amount of juice in the bowl. Dump that shit on your sandwiches before topping with the cheesy piece of bread (cheese side down, duh).

\- 5-8g dried chili (adjust as needed)

\- 2-3g Sichuan peppercorns

\- 10g ginger

\- 1 cinnamon stick

\- 2-3 star anise

\- 2 bay leaves

\- 1 half onion

\- 1 tbsp chili bean paste

\- 1.2L boiling water

\- 2 tbsps soy sauce

\- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce

\- 3g salt

Hand Pulled Noodles:

\- 150g all purpose flour

\- 90ml water

\- 2g salt

&amp;#x200B;

Garnish:

\- 2 Baby bok choy

\- 1 garlic clove (chopped)

\- 1 green onion (chopped)

&amp;#x200B;

[Click here for a full video with detailed instructions.](https://youtu.be/1Kp9gzLRoaA)

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

Beef soup:

1. Wash and clean 2lb beef. Turn on the high heat and boil the beef in cold water. Add 4-5 ginger slices and 1oz Chinese cooking wine. Turn down the heat to medium when boiling. Boil for 15 min and get rid of beef scum.
2. Dump the water and let the beef cool down. Cut it into cubes.
3. Chop a half onion and prepare dry spices.
4. In a big pot, stir fry dry spices in 3 tbsps oil in medium heat for 2 min. Then stir fry chopped onions for 2 min. Add beef and stir fry for 2 minutes. Then add chili bean paste and stir fry everything for 2 minutes.
5. In the same pot, add 1.2L boiling water, 2 tbsps soy sauce, 1 tbsp dark soy sauce, 3g salt. Simmer for 2 hours in low heat.

Hand pulled noodles:

1. Mix flour, salt and water together to make a dough. The ratio of flour to water is 1:0.6. Rest for 30 minutes.
2. After resting, knead the dough for 2 minutes, and rest for another 30 min.
3. Brush some oil on the work surface, roll out the dough to 0.5 inch thick. Brush more oil on both sides to keep its moisture, cover it with a plastic wrapper. Rest for 2-3 hours.
4. Cut the dough into 0.5 inch strips. Stretch and slap the noodle on the work surface.
5. Boil the fresh noodles for 1.5 min. Boil some baby bok choy for 30 seconds.
6. Add chopped garlic and green onions to finish off the perfect bowl of braised beef noodle soup!

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. Resting the dough is the key of making hand pulled noodles. The dough will develop gluten by itself and become elastic.
2. Salt not only provides flavor, but also strengthens gluten bonding.
3. Slapping the noodle on the work surface can help it stretch evenly.

&amp;#x200B;

This dish is super delicious and well-balanced. The noodle is chewy, beef is soft and savory, the broth is steaming hot and packed with flavors. It looks time-consuming, but mostly you just need to wait for the soup to gain flavors and for the dough to form gluten. It is not hard work, and the payoff is absolutely worth it!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ik2b2i/braised_beef_noodle_soup_with_hand_pulled_noodles/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ik2b2i/braised_beef_noodle_soup_with_hand_pulled_noodles/

Yes, you can go to a fancy steakhouse. Spend 300 dollars. And walk away with a full belly and a happy heart, but very empty pockets! Instead, you can save a ton of money and have a fabulous steak dinner that is JUST as good right at home. I swear – it’s not that hard!

Start with a good-quality piece of filet mignon (AKA tenderloin) and whip up a six ingredient mushroom wine reduction sauce that will melt your heart.

This recipe rivals the best steak houses around, and I’ll even show you how to make the sides to go with it too.

The only thing I ask before we begin: open your best bottle of red….

 

 

Makes: for 2 people

THE INGREDIENTS
2, ½ pound filet mignons (pieces of tenderloin)

8 tablespoons butter

3 tablespoons olive oil

2 large shallots, finely chopped

2 cups low sodium beef broth

2 cups red wine (I use merlot)

1 heaping tablespoon tomato paste

1 cup mushroom medley, roughly chopped (I used cremini, portobello and chanterelle)

Salt and pepper

For creamy roasted garlic potato puree:

4 large Yukon gold potatoes, peeled (or sub white potatoes)

4 tablespoons butter

2 tablespoons sour cream

1 head elephant garlic

¼ cup cream (more if potatoes aren’t loose/creamy enough)

Salt and pepper

For sautéed spinach:

1 package spinach

1 large clove garlic

3 tablespoons olive oil

 

THE STEPS
For reduction sauce:

Over medium heat, add 6 tablespoons and shallots, tossing shallots with a spoon to sauté for 3 minutes. Add tomato paste and sauté for another 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and sauté for 2 minutes. Then add beef broth and wine. Turn heat up to medium high and mix thoroughly. Put the pot lid on and let sauce reduce for 15-20 minutes until sauce has reduce to about one quarter of the liquid that was originally there. Stir sauce every few minutes while sauce is reducing. When sauce has reduced, keep sauce on very low heat while you cook the filets.

For the filets, in a nonstick large skillet, add 2 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons olive oil.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Turn stovetop to high heat. When butter/oil is sizzling, add filets a few inches apart. Let meat (that is dusted with pepper and salt) brown on each side for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and place filets loosely wrapped in foil on a cookie sheet. For medium rare cook filets for 5-10 minutes until a meat thermometer reaches 130-135 degrees, or for medium at 140-145 degrees.

 

For creamy roasted garlic potato puree:

Boil potatoes until you can easily pierce the potatoes with a fork, about 25-30 minutes. Mash potatoes with a masher. Transfer potatoes to a mixer. Add 2-3 large roasted garlic cloves, butter, sour cream, cream, salt and pepper to the potatoes. On medium, mix potatoes until light, fluffy, and pureed, adding more cream and sour cream to taste and texture. Serve immediately.

 

For sautéed spinach:

In a large pot, add olive oil and garlic over medium low heat. Sauté garlic for 1 minute. Add spinach and tossed until just wilted, about 3-5 minutes. Serve immediately.

 

Add a bed of spinach over a layer of potato puree. Generously spoon reduction over filets.

gfhsgn,The Best Beef Stroganoff with Homemade Spaetzle -- Tried Many Variations and This is My Favorite,11,10,1588894223.0,0.92,Beef,IndustryCat,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/gfhsgn/the_best_beef_stroganoff_with_homemade_spaetzle/,"Your Spätzle look actually quite good!
If you wanna experiment a little more Käsespätzle might be something you would like.
Just cook them the way you already do without adding any optional ingredients.
Then cut some onions in rings and fry them til golden brown.

gcsw8z,Reverse-seared Steak with Garlic Herb Butter,153,8,1588521351.0,0.95,Beef,poor_coIIege_student,https://i.redd.it/a7hr0n1onkw41.png,"I've been making reverse-seared steak for about a year now, and it's by far my favorite way to make steak! It turns out so juicy and tender every time. Here I ate it with a side of caramelized onions, roasted cherry tomatoes, and home fries. 

**Ingredients**  
• 1 thick-cut steak  
• Salt  
• Ground pepper  
• 4 tbsp butter (2 tablespoons softened)  
• 3 clove garlic (1 clove minced; 2 cloves smashed)  
• ½ tsp dry thyme or other herbs (use 1 tsp if using fresh herbs)  
• 2 tbsp vegetable oil (any oil with a high smoke point works)  
**Instructions**  
• Preheat the oven to 250°F  
• In the meantime, prepare the steak. Pat the surface dry with a paper towel. Place the steak on a wire rack on a baking sheet and season both sides liberally with salt and pepper  
• Place the baking tray in the oven on the middle rack. Bake the steak until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the steak reads 95°F for medium rare, 105°F for medium  
• While the steak is baking, mix your softened butter with the minced garlic and herbs.  
• When the steak has almost reached the desired internal temperature in the oven, heat up a skillet over high heat  
• After removing the steak from the oven, add oil to the hot pan. When the oil is hot, place your steak in the pan and cook on one side for about a minute, until a nice dark crust forms  
• Flip the steak and add 2 tablespoons of butter with the smashed garlic to the pan. Cook and baste the steak with the butter for another minute. Flip back over and baste for another 30 seconds  
• Hold the steak on its side and cook off some of the fat for 30 seconds to a minute  
• Remove the steak from the pan and scoop the prepared garlic-herb butter on top of it. Let the steak rest for 5 minutes, then it's ready to be sliced!

You can of course add whatever toppings you like, this recipe is more an idea and an explanation of my own version.

INGREDIENTS FOR 3 BURGERS

* 3 burger buns
* 500gr of minced beef
* 2 onions
* 3 gherkins
* Some lettuce
* 2 tablespoons of ketchup
* 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon of sweet yellow mustard
* 3 slices of cheddar
* 3 slices of gouda

## DIRECTIONS

1. Dice one of the onions and thinly slice the other. Also dice the gherkins.
2. Mix the diced onion with the mayonnaise and the sweet yellow mustard.
3. Mix the diced gherkins and the ketchup.
4. Toast the buns.
5. Preheat a pan with some oil on high heat until smoking point.
6. Separate the mince into 3 balls. Put them one by one in the hot pan and press them down with something flat. Add salt and pepper to taste, then top it with a good layer of the sliced onion.
7. Pre-build the burgers while the patties are cooking:

* Spread some of the ketchup/gherkin mix on the bottom bun, add a leaf of lettuce and the slice of gouda (the gouda will melt with the heat of the patty).
* Spread the mayonnaise/mustard/onion mix on the top bun.

1. When the bottom side of the patty is beautifully brown and crispy, flip the patties so they lie on the onion layer. Add a slice of cheddar on each patty and cover.
2. When the cheddar is melted, put the patties of the pre-built bottom bun and top with the top bun.

Beef ribs recipe is from here: [https://www.themamaneedscake.com/instant-pot-beef-back-ribs/](https://www.themamaneedscake.com/instant-pot-beef-back-ribs/)

I added ""liquid smoke"" to the pot before I started to pressure cook it. I ended up using Bull's Eye ""Old West Hickory"" BBQ sauce as that's the first one I saw at the grocery store and was in a rush.

**Mashed Potatoes:**

5 pounds bag Russet potatoes, peeled &amp; cubed

4 tablespoons softened butter

2 teaspoons salt

1 cup organic heavy cream (more if needed)

4 garlic cloves, minced

1/4 cup Parmesan cheese -dry

1/4 cup fresh Parmesan cheese, shredded

**Savory Gravy:**

4 tablespoons butter

4 tablespoons flour

3 cups beef broth

2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce

1 teaspoon salt

1/2 teaspoon rosemary

1 teaspoon sugar

1/2 teaspoon sherry

1/4 teaspoon black pepper

&amp;#x200B;

## Instructions

* Place the peeled and chopped potatoes in a large stock pot and completely cover with water.
* Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a light boil, and cook until fork tender, 10-12 minutes.
* Add 4 Tbsp butter, and cream those together.
* Add the heavy cream, both Parmesan cheeses, salt, and garlic.
* Mix until creamy adding more heavy cream if necessary to reach desired consistency.
* For the gravy, heat a medium saucepan over medium heat, and add 4 Tbsp butter.
* Once butter melts, add the flour and whisk until smooth.
* Add the beef broth, increase the heat to medium high, and whisk constantly.
* Add the remaining gravy ingredients, and whisk until it thickens. This may take several minutes.
* Cover and remove from heat. Serve the gravy over the garlic mashed potatoes.Mashed potatoes recipe is from here: [https://food52.com/recipes/78251-garlic-mashed-potatoes-savory-gravy](https://food52.com/recipes/78251-garlic-mashed-potatoes-savory-gravy)

fyc319,8.5Hour Smoked Beef Ribs,6,2,1586508597.0,0.75,Beef,Andrew_Kite,https://i.redd.it/wvdi6tr2fyr41.jpg,"A little different approach with this one. Thought I would give smoking these with wood chips on an electric bbq (Weber Pulse 2000). So this will be handy for those in an apartment where restrictions are in place. The smoke chips did not create a lot of smoke and still created a great taste!

I’m no expert in smoking ribs, but I thought the below worked really well for me.

INGREDIENTS
- 3.5kg Beef Ribs
- Bottle of Apple Cider.

(Dry Rub)
- 6 Tablespoons ground pepper
- 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar
- 2 Tablespoons onion powder
- 4 Teaspoons mustard powder
- 4 Teaspoons garlic powder
- 4 Teaspoons chili powder
- 2 Teaspoons chipotle powder

METHOD
1. Remove the membrane from the back of ribs. Use a paper towel for grip. Trim off excess fat on top of ribs.

2. Salt generously, all sides of the meat with kosher salt, and leave overnight. If unable to do overnight, salt for at least an hour before hand.

3. Once ready to cook, take the ribs out of fridge and pat dry excess water.
Use the dry rub all over the meat, patting down.

4. Set electric bbq to max and add wood chips (I used Hickory). Use a smoker box, or wrap in foil and make holes for smoke to escape. Optionally, pre soak wood chips for 30mins prior, but I had issues with the electric bbq getting them hot enough to smoke if wet.

5. Once smoking, reduce heat to 120°C. And turn one element off. (This will be the side we place our ribs over for indirect heating).
Place ribs on the side you turned the element off, and use a thermometer to track temperature in the center of the ribs.

6. Don’t open the bbq until internal temperature of ribs are 70°C. Spray the tops of the ribs with the Apple Cider. Continuing to do so every 30-60minutes.
*Optionally, for a tender set of ribs, double wrap in foil or butchers paper, I did this with one, and it came out more tender, but the bark that formed was not quite as good as seen in the image. I recommend unwrapped)

7. Once the internal temperature is at 92°C, it’s time to check the ribs. Take a probe, or knife, and probe the meat. If it goes through easily, the ribs are ready to be removed.

8. Let the ribs sit for at least half an hour before cutting in. This is the hardest part of the entire cook when you can smell how good they are!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fyc319/85hour_smoked_beef_ribs/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fyc319/85hour_smoked_beef_ribs/

Gluten-Free Slow Cooker Corned Beef and Cabbage

This easy slow cooker Corned Beef recipe gets extra flavor from the addition of a flavorful gluten-free beer that marinates the beef as it slow cooks to fork-tender delicious mouthfuls. 

Time in Slow Cooker on LOW heat:  9 hours

Ingredients

2 medium onions, peeled and cut into thick crescents

6 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed flat

3 to 4 lb corned beef brisket with spice packet

12 oz (1 1/2 cups) gluten-free beer (such as RedBridge or Glutenberg)

2 1/2 cups water

2 TBSP sugar

2 TBSP apple cider vinegar

1 bay leaf

1 1/2 lbs potatoes, cut into wedges

1 lb carrots, ends trimmed and cut into bite-sized pieces

1 small head cabbage (about 1 1/2 lbs), cored and cut into 1 1/2-inch thick wedges

Cookware

6-quart or 7-quart slow cooker

1-quart liquid measuring cup or medium mixing bowl

Kitchen timer (optional)

Ladle

Large slotted spoon

Plastic (non-wood) cutting board

Instructions

1.  Peel the onions and cut them into thick crescents.  Place the onion crescents flat side down in a single layer on the bottom of the slow cooker to form a base for the corned beef brisket.

2.  Peel the garlic cloves.  Smash each clove flat with a kitchen mallet or the flat side of a table knife.  Place the smashed garlic cloves in an even layer over the onion crescents. 

3.  Trim excess fat from the corned beef brisket if necessary.  Reserve the spice packet.  Lay the brisket with its flattest side down on top of the layer of onions and garlic.

4.  Sprinkle the contents of the spice packet evenly over the top of the brisket.  Press the spices into the top surface of the brisket.

5.  Carefully pour the gluten-free beer into the slow cooker, pouring to the side of the brisket so as not to disturb the spices coating the top of the brisket. 

6.  Mix the water, sugar, and apple cider vinegar in a 1-quart liquid measuring cup or medium mixing bowl.  Stir until the sugar is completely dissolved into the liquid. 

7.  Slowly pour the water and apple cider vinegar mixture into the bottom of the slow cooker, pouring to the side of the brisket so as not to disturb the spices coating the top of the brisket.  Only pour enough of the water and apple cider vinegar mixture to barely cover the brisket.  Discard any unused liquid.  If you have a larger slow cooker it may be necessary to add additional water to cover the brisket.

8.  Add the bay leaf to the slow cooker, submerging it under the liquid.

9.  Place the slow cooker on a heat-resistant surface (a raised broiler pan works well for this if your countertop is not heatproof).  Cover the slow cooker with its lid.  Turn on the slow cooker and program it to cook on LOW heat for 10 hours.  Set your kitchen timer or program your cell phone to alert you to add the vegetables after 4 hours of cooking time.

10.  Scrub the potatoes and carrots under running water and lay them on a clean kitchen towel on your countertop so that they can come to room temperature before being added to the slow cooker.

11.  When 4 hours of cooking time has elapsed cut the potatoes into wedges.  Trim the ends from the carrots and cut them into bite-sized pieces.  Take the lid off the slow cooker and layer the potatoes in an even layer over the corned beef brisket.  Layer the carrots over the potatoes.  Place the lid back on the slow cooker and continue cooking on LOW heat for 3 more hours.  Set your kitchen timer or program your cell phone to alert you to add the cabbage after 3 hours of cooking time.  Transfer the cabbage to your countertop so that it comes to room temperature before adding it to the slow cooker.

12.  After 7 hours of cooking time has elapsed (3 hours after adding the carrots and potatoes) prepare the cabbage.  Remove the outer leaves of the cabbage.  Cut the cabbage in half from top to bottom and carve out the tough inner core from each half of the cabbage.  Discard the core material.  Cut the cabbage into  1 1/2-inch thick wedges.

13.  Take the lid off the slow cooker.  Use a ladle to remove excess liquid if necessary so that there is enough room to add the cabbage.  Leave enough liquid to cover the brisket.  Layer the cabbage wedges flat side down over the carrots and potatoes. 

14.  Cover the slow cooker with the lid and continue cooking on LOW heat for 2 more hours until the cabbage is tender-crisp (9 hours total cooking time).  Set your kitchen timer or program your cell phone to alert you that the meal is done after 2 additional hours of cooking time.

15.  When the cabbage has cooked for 2 hours and the brisket has cooked for a total of 9 hours take the lid off the slow cooker.  Use a slotted spoon to lift and drain the cabbage, carrots, and potatoes.  Arrange the vegetable on the serving plates, leaving room for slices of the brisket.  Discard the bay leaf.

16.  Lift the brisket out of the slow cooker and transfer it to a non-porous (plastic) cutting board.  Slice the brisket into thick slices.  Arrange the slices of brisket on the serving plates next to the vegetables.

17.  If desired, use the slotted spoon to lift and drain the onions and garlic from the slow cooker.  Arrange the onions and garlic on the serving plates.  Serve immediately while warm.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fhoym2/slow_cooker_corned_beef_and_cabbage_for_st/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fhoym2/slow_cooker_corned_beef_and_cabbage_for_st/

Set Instant Pot to Sauté. While the IP is warming salt and pepper the beef. Once the IP is pre-heated add the butter. Sear the meat, I had two roasts so I did mine individually using the plate to hold the first roast while I seared the second one.

Once both roasts are seared. Set IP to Pressure Cook for 1 hr on High Pressure. Add Water or Broth to pot, scrape down the bottom of the pot to prevent the Burn alert from triggering. Add the beef back to the pot, seal and wait.

Once the IP is done do a 5-10 minute natural release before releasing the vent.

Pull the beef out of the pot and set aside on the plate. Add the mushrooms and onions to the pot. Let them percolate for a bit while you mix the contents of the packets with 2 Cups of water. Add the liquid to the pot and give it a good stir. Mix the corn starch with enough liquid to make a slurry. 

Turn the IP to Sauté. Add the Cornstarch slurry to the pot and let boil until a nice gravy comes together.

Boil the pasta.

Shred the beef with two forks removing fat chunks as you find them. Add the beef back to the pot. Stir. 

Serve over the pasta.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/eiqf1i/hot_beef_with_noodles/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/eiqf1i/hot_beef_with_noodles/

About 30 mins before it’s done, I toss in some carrots, cabbage, and baby red potatoes. I also trim off most of the fat and gristle before I boil it.  Usually takes about 2-3 hours and then I let it rest for 30 mins and slice it AGAINST the grain.  If you cut it with the grain, you get long strings of meat, like jerky; cutting across the grain makes it fall apart in your mouth.

Toppings:

Whatever you like, really. (One is very important though.) Here is what I like.

Lettuce

Tomato

Pickles

Pickled Onion* (*this is the important one, and it's 100% worth it. Plus, it's so easy! Ingredients and Instructions below.)



For Sauce:

½ cup Mayonnaise

1 tablespoon Dijon mustard (or ½ mustard+ ¼ tsp vinegar + pinch sugar (as substitute))

1 teaspoon Ketchup

¼ teaspoon Pickle brine (preferably dill pickle brine)

just a pinch of cayenne pepper (can be substituted with Paprika)



For Burgers:

4 Brioche/Sesame Seed/Pretzel/Potato roll buns (whatever you like, I use Brioche or Sesame)

12.8 oz (360g) Ground Beef*

8 Cheese Singles 

1 Egg* (*Optional, only if you get frozen ground beef and it doesn't stick when you form the patties)

Salt &amp; Pepper, to taste

4 Tbsp. Butter/Oil (I prefer Butter)

More butter for Buns, as needed

A bit of water

Instructions:

For Pickled Onions:

1 Onion, chopped into half circles

1 Cup Apple Cider Vinegar 

1 Cup Water

1 Tbsp. Sugar

1 Tbsp. Salt

4-5 Cloves (optional)



INSTRUCTIONS:

Let's start with the Pickled Onions.

Add the Vinegar, Water, Sugar and Salt in a small pot and leave it on high heat until it's boiling. 

Then remove from the heat and had your chopped onions.

Make sure the onions are covered with the brine then just leave it for 30 minutes to an hour and you can use it!



NEXT: Sauce

Combine your Mayo, Dijon, Bickle Brine, Ketchup and Pepper to a small bowl and mix it together. taste it and see if it needs a bit of salt. That's literally it.



THEN: Burgers

Get your beef in a bowl and add a beaten egg (If you have frozen ground beef, or it it still doesn't stick). 

Form your meat into 3.2 oz patties (4oz if you want a bigger patty, 8 oz if you want Pub-Style, but all of these will affect how much ground beef you will need.)

Press your thumb in the middle of the burger to make a small hole (but only until halfway through, don't make a burger donut) This is to assure your patty won't shrink too much.

If you want to skip the previous step, make sure your patty is 1 inch wider than your bun, so it shrinks to the right size.

Season the patty with some salt and pepper.

Get a Cast Iron pan over Very High heat and add a tbsp of butter per patty. If you're doing 2 at a time do 2 tbsp, etc.

After the butter is melted and covering the pan, add the burger(s). Try not to move or squeeze the burger(s) as much as possible. After 3 minutes*, flip the burger(s), then immediately add 2 cheese singles per patty. Add a splash of water to the pan and then immediately cover it with a lid. This is to help melt the cheese.

After around 2:30 to 3 minutes, remove the burger(s) and set them aside on a plate.


AFTER: Buns

Get your Buns and cut them in half. Brush all them with a healthy amount of butter.

Get that same pan you were making the burger(s) in and toast the buns. I only toast the buttered side of the buns.

Always stay close to the buns and check often until toasty enough for you.

(Toasting buns helps them from getting soggy, and nobody likes soggy buns or burgers)


FINALLY: Assembly.

Sauce all your bun halves with the special sauce we just made. Get your bottom bun. Add Lettuce, then Burger, then Pickled Onions, then Tomato, then Pickles, then top bun. Keep it stable with a toothpick, so it doesn't fall apart.

Serve with crinkle-cut fries, for

NOTES:

*3.2 oz per patty. That's what I like. You can add more or less, whatever you like, it won't reallya ffect the recipe. 4 oz if you want it big and 8 oz if you want it pub-style, aka 

#REALLY BIG.

*Special Sauce is literally just Shake Shack Sauce. Don't blame me, it's really good.

*Pickled Onions are actually not my idea, but It's a recipe from Alexis, a chef at Buzzfeed's Tasty. I tried them and they are delicious, and work really well on burgers. Thanks, Alexis!

*You can use the pickle brine from the Pickles you can use as burger toppings, 2 in 1!

3. Dill pickles
4. Tillamook Cheddar

2. Spread a bit of mayo on those guys and let them sit.
3. Ball up a decent sized portion of meat with your hands (depends on how much bun you’re working with, but keep an eye on your ratio of meat to bun for optimal enjoyment).
4. Turn up the heat on the pan you used to toast the buns to the highest heat setting, and wait until the pan gets really hot.
5. Smash that ball down on the pan with a spatula, and make sure those edges get spread thin. Salt to taste.
6. Cook until the edges start getting crispy, and then flip.
7. Add cheese on top after the flip, and let it melt while the other side of the burger browns.

1 stem of fresh garlic

1 bell pepper  
6 small spicy chilis  (optional)  
50 ml lemon juice 
1 handful chives  
1/4 bunch mint    
1/3 bunch cilantro   

1. Brown the lamb in a heavy-bottomed pot or large pan at medium-high heat.  
2. Cut the onion into half rings, the spring onions in rings, the garlic stem into thin strips, and the bell pepper in strips as well. Add to pot with a good swig of olive oil, reduce heat to medium, braise for 5 minutes.  
3.  Slice garlic cloves as thinly as possible. Remove seeds and seed housing from chilis, chop into small pieces. Add to pot, braise until garlic blooms.  
4. Add whole plums. Add lemon juice. Add hot water until everything is almost covered. Add a teaspoon of salt. Stir well, reduce heat to low.   
5. Cook covered for an hour a low heat, stirring occasionally.   
6. The plums should start to soften and deflate, the meat should start to soften. Uncover, leave to cook for another 30 min.   
7. Plums should be starting to fall apart, meat should be reaaaally tender. Chop the chives, cilantro and mint, add to pot. Stir well, let cook for 10 more minutes. Taste, finish with salt as necessary.    
8. Serve with crusty white bread.  

You can replace or augment the lemon with white wine. The whole dish should be fairly acidic, you'll only be able to tell in the end once the plums have fallen apart.  
You should rather use too little than too much mint, it can easily overpower the whole dish. Since it's added at the end anyway you can always add more.   

This is inspired by Georgian Chakapuli, but I couldn't find Tarragon and didn't have white wine left, so I changed it quite a bit. It's spicy, saucy and tart, and quite refreshing.   

The green plums make the dish - I love spring, and these little bastards. Great as a snack with a little salt, or as a spicy sauce (or stew...).  You can get them at the nearest Turkish grocer (yesil erik) or a Georgian or Armenian store, whatever is close.

Bring to a boil, and cook the wine down until reduced by half.

Add the stock until the ribs are nearly covered.

Put a lid on or cover with foil and place in the oven for 3-4 hours.

Minutes before the short ribs are done, fry off the pancetta.

Add the mushrooms to the pancetta pan and fry until the just start to release their moisture.

Pull the ribs from the oven and pour the sauce / drippings through a sieve and press all the flavour from the garlic.

Serve the ribs with the pancetta mushrooms on top and drizzle with the sauce.

This tamale pie might just be the most delicious thing I've ever cooked. It's made with Serious Eat's masa instead of cornbread. The beef and ancho sauce would also be good on their own or in empanadas, tacos, enchiladas, you name it.

Ingredients:

Beef:

2 lbs top round or equivalent cut, trimmed of excess fat

1 tbsp high heat oil, such as vegetable oil

1/2 tsp course salt

1/2 tsp black pepper

3/4 tsp cumin

1/2 tsp onion powder

1/2 tsp garlic powder

1 tsp chili powder

1 yellow onion, thinly sliced

3 cloves garlic, minced

1 cup beef broth

1 tbsp tomato paste

1 tbsp apple cider vinegar


Masa:

3 cups masa

3 cups chicken broth

3/4 cup cold vegetable shortening

2 tsp salt

2 tsp baking powder


Ancho sauce:

1 tbsp high heat oil, such as vegetable oil

1 dried ancho chile

2 tbsp yellow onion, chopped

1 clove garlic, minced

1/4 cup tomato paste

1 cup chicken broth

1/2 tsp brown sugar

1/4 tsp salt

1/4 tsp cumin

2 tsp apple cider vinegar

1/2 tsp chili powder

2 tbsp water


Prepare the beef:

Pat beef dry with paper towels. Mix together salt, pepper, 1/2 tsp cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, and 1/s tsp chili powder. Spread the spice mix over the meat on all sides.

Heat a large Dutch oven over high heat. Add vegetable oil. Add meat and cook on all sides until well browned, about 2-3 minutes on each side. Remove meat and place on a clean plate.

Reduce heat to medium. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. While cooking, use a wooden spoon to scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven. These will provide so much flavor!

Stir in tomato paste and cook for about 1 minute. Add broth, apple cider vinegar, and remaining 1/4 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp chili powder and stir well.

Return the beef to the Dutch oven. Bring the liquid to a boil, and then reduce heat to low and let simmer for 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Flip the beef about every 30 minutes. Beef is ready when it is cooked thoroughly and fork tender.

Remove the beef from the pot and shred it using two forks. Return beef to the pot and keep warm until ready to assemble the pie.


Make the masa:

In a large bowl, stir masa and broth.

Using a mixer, mix together shortening, salt, and baking powder on medium-high speed until whipped, about 1 minute.

Add masa mixture, about 1 1/2 cup at a time, until well combined. Masa mixture should be soft and spreadable.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.


Prepare the sauce:

Preheat the oven to 350F. Place ancho chile on a small baking sheet. Toast in the oven for 3 minutes, or until fragrant. Let cool, remove stem and seeds, and chop. Set aside.

In a medium sauce pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions and garlic and cook until softened and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir in tomato paste until onion and garlic are fully coated. Whisk in chicken broth, sugar, salt, cumin, vinegar, and chili powder. Stir in chopped ancho chili.

Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Let simmer for 20 minutes.

Transfer sauce to a blender with the 2 tbsp of water. Blend until smooth. Set aside until pie is ready to be assembled. The sauce can be made a day in advance if desired.


Put it all together:

Preheat oven to 375F. Coat a 12 inch cast iron skillet with cooking spray or vegetable oil.

Spread enough masa over cast iron to completely cover the bottom, and to extend about 1 1/2 inch up the sides of the pan.

Stir the ancho sauce into the beef, coating the beef thoroughly.

Spoon the beef over the masa until evenly distributed.
Spread the rest of the masa over the beef until the filling is completely covered in masa. Press lightly the seal the edges and smooth the masa over the beef.

Bake for 45 minutes, or until masa is lightly golden on top.

9rupmu,Pot Roast,79,27,1540651090.0,0.88,Beef,Simmyphila,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/9rupmu/pot_roast/,"In my experience, you're always better off using the oven and a casserole dish or dutch oven for pot roast. It takes half the time, and comes out with a much better crust on both the meat and veggies. Here's how I do it in both scenarios (I copy/pasted this from a recipe I sent to a friend, sorry if there's anything oddly specific in it):  
  
**Meat:**  
-1 chuck roast, ~3 lbs. Try to get something with good marbling and lots of fat.

**Produce:**  
-red russet potatoes: 6 of them if they're the size of your fist, 10-15 if they're the itty-bitty ones (the smaller the potatoes, the less chopping you'll have to do)  
-1 bulb of garlic (medium small)  
-2 cartons of mushrooms (I use whole baby bella mushrooms)  
-7 large carrots (a big bag of baby carrots means less work, but won't taste as good)  
-1 large white onion  
  
**Spices:**  
(Fresh is so much better, but means a lot more food prep. Also more expensive.)  
-Rosemary  
-Thyme  
-Oregano  
(alternatively, you can get Italian seasoning, which includes all of the above. Cheaper, but you can't use them individually)  
-Basil  
-Black Pepper  
-Salt  
-4 bay leaves  

**Misc:**  
-Cheap baking pan (deeper is better, mine is 3"" deep)  
-1 quart of beef broth  
-1 can of Campbell's Beefy Mushroom  
-Dry red wine (I use Pinot Noir, but any dry red will do)  
-Vegetable or canola oil (not olive oil, smoke point is too low and you'll fill your house with smoke)  
-Aluminum Foil (It needs to cover your pan, you may want to get the extra-wide rolls)  
  
**Oven Directions:**  
Pat the roast dry with paper towels, coat all over with lots of oil, and season liberally with salt and pepper. Let it sit at room temp while you prep the veggies.  
-Chop the onion into 8th's.  
-Peel carrots, chop into 2-3 inch segments.  
-wash mushrooms, chop big pieces in half or quarters, whatever is bite-sized.  
-peel garlic. If you don't have a garlic press, chop into a very fine dice.  
-Chop potatoes into bite sized pieces.  
  
Pre-heat the oven to 325 degrees F. Sear the roast. This will make lots of smoke. Open some windows, unplug your smoke alarm, and turn on your stove fan. You can skip this step, but the roast won't have a very good char. Get a frying pan big enough to fit your whole roast in, and coat it with a generous amount of oil. Get it as hot as you can (if your stove fan sucks, maybe go around medium to med-high) and sear the roast until it has a nice dark char on all sides. When done, move the roast to the baking pan.  
  
Add the 4 bay leaves and garlic (evenly spaced around the roast), then add all your veggies and mushrooms around the roast. Nothing should be covering the roast, especially if you skipped the searing step. I like to keep the onion in chunks instead of breaking up its layers. Add the basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and more black pepper, just sprinkle a decent layer of everything over the veggies. Next, add the liquids. The goal here is to rinse the seasoning off the top of the veggies so that it's evenly dispersed between the top and bottom. Start with the Beefy Mushroom (because it's thickest), then 1 cup of wine, and then add beef broth until the liquid level comes up to about two thirds of the way to the top of your baking pan. Cover the pan with aluminum foil, shiny side down. Try to seal the foil as pest you can to keep the moisture in.  
  
Put the baking pan on the middle rack of the oven, and cook for 2 hours. Remove the aluminum foil, add more broth if the liquid level is getting low, then cook for another 1.5 hours. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F, add more broth if needed, and cook for another 30 minutes. If you skipped the searing step, you can add a little char by turning on the broiler at this point, but don't let it go for too long or it might dry out the roast.  
  
**Slow Cooker Directions:**  
  
Follow all the steps above, except put the roast in the bottom of the slow cooker, and pile the garlic, veggies, and spices on top. DO NOT OVER FILL WITH LIQUIDS, everything will expand, and the liquid will spill everywhere, so don't fill over half way. Set for 8 hours, and enjoy.

I've condensed down the steps a bit.

**Ingredients**

* 2 pounds beef stew meat
* 1/2 cup all purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon seasoned salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 1 medium yellow onion diced
* 2 stalks celery diced
* 3 cups water
* 3 teaspoons (aka 1Tbsp) heaping Better than Bouillon concentrated beef stock
* 1 tsp minced garlic
* 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 3 large carrots peeled and diced
* 4 russet potatoes diced into chunks (or one bag of the small fork potatoes at Aldi, halved)
* 1 cup frozen peas

**Instructions**

1. Cut up stew meat into 1"" chunks.
2. In a large Ziploc bag, add flour, seasoned salt and pepper. Seal bag and shake to combine dry ingredients.
2. After combining, add in stew meat. Shake well to coat with flour.
3. In a large pot, over high heat, pour in vegetable oil.
4. Once the oil is hot, add floured beef chunks (in two batches). Don't shake off too much of the flour when you take them out. The flour will actually help thicken up the stew some.
5. Brown half of the beef chunks then do a second batch until they are all browned. We are not cooking the meat all the way. Just browning it will help give the beef a great color and flavor. Brown until there are little chunks of brown stuff stuck to the bottom of the pan - we need those later.
6. Take out the browned beef and set aside, season with pepper.
7. If necessary add a tad bit more oil to the pot, turn down the heat to medium, then add in diced onion and celery. Cook until translucent (just a few minutes.)
8. Scrape the bottom of the pan and loosen any brown bits (lots of flavor in those!)
9. Add water, the ""Better than Bouillon"" paste, Worcestershire sauce and garlic and stir well.
10. Add meat back to the pot, then toss in the diced carrots and potatoes. Stir to combine.
11. Cover and cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes, then turn down the heat to low and allow to simmer for 35-45 minutes (until potatoes are fork tender.)
12. Give stew a stir every so often while cooking.
13. Ten minutes before you're ready to serve, stir in frozen peas and cover pot.
14. Once peas are tender, you are ready to dig in!

Personally, this is the best stew recipe I've found online. The Better than Bouillon gives better results than the beef stock alternative that she mentions imo - I've tried both and now have a favorite new product.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/8ojs9t/best_ever_beef_stew/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/8ojs9t/best_ever_beef_stew/

I only seared one side because I don't eat my beef anything more cooked than rare, but I did want the caramelized and smoky flavor that comes from searing. The slices were so thin that to flip them would have ensured at minimum a medium. If you want to cook it on both sides, or if you get your hands on a log type piece, then you're in luck and can sear on all sides.

Happy eatings!

**Recipe**

- 6 – 8 ounces really marbled sliced beef (shortrib, wagyu, or kobe all work–you want it fatty and melting in your mouth!)
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon sake
- 1 clove garlic, finely minced
- 1 tablespoon thinly sliced scallion
- 1 tablespoon miso paste
- 1 raw egg yolk
- 1 bowl of hot white rice

1. Freeze sliced beef for one hour until firm. This prevents it from cooking through before the side is seared.
2. Combine miso paste and thinly sliced scallion. Set to the side.
3. Combine sesame oil, soy sauce, mirin, sugar, sake, and minced garlic 4. together and quickly toss the beef slices into it.
5. Allow it to marinate while you bring heat a pan on high heat (careful, this will set off your smoke alarms).
6. Take the slices and lay them down on the pan to sear, keep on for approximately 25-30 seconds, or until the one side begins to caramelize and char.
7. Quickly remove from heat and lay on bed of white rice.
8. Top with negi miso and raw egg yolk. I like to break the egg yolk so it runs all over the meat, take a small smidge of the negi miso, smear it on the meat, and eat with a bite of rice.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/8ajt0f/singleside_seared_marbled_shortib_and_negi_miso/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/8ajt0f/singleside_seared_marbled_shortib_and_negi_miso/

Servings 4 servings

**Ingredients**

   * 1 pound flank steak
   * 1/4 cup cornstarch
   * 1/4 cup canola oil oil
   * 2 teaspoons fresh ginger minced
   * 1 tablespoon garlic minced
   * 1/3 cup lite soy sauce low sodium
   * 1/3 cup water
   * 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
   * 4 stalks scallions green parts only, cut into 2 inch pieces

***
**Instructions**

1. Slice the flank steak against the grain (the grain is the length of the steak) the long way 1/4 inch think pieces and add it to a ziploc bag with the cornstarch.
    
2. Press the steak around in the bag making sure each piece is fully coated with cornstarch and leave it to sit while you make the sauce.
    
3. Add the canola oil to a large frying pan and heat on medium high heat.
    
4. Add the steak, shaking off any excess corn starch to the pan in a single layer and cook on each side for 1 minute.
    
5. If you need to cook the steak in batches because your pan isn't big enough do that rather than crowding the pan, you want to get a good sear on the steak and if you crowd the pan your steak with steam instead of sear.
    
6. When the steak is done cooking remove it from the pan.
    
7. Add the ginger and garlic to the pan and sauté for 10-15 seconds.
    
8. Add the soy sauce, water and dark brown sugar to the pan and let it come to a boil.
    
9. Add the steak back in and let the sauce thicken for 20-30 seconds.
    
10. The cornstarch we used on the steak should thicken the sauce, if you find it isn't thickening enough add 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to 1 tablespoon of cold water and stir to dissolve the cornstarch and add it to the pan.
    
11. Add the green onions, stir to combine everything, and cook for a final 20-30 seconds.
    
Serve immediately.

***
**Ingredients**

   * 3 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, cut into chunks
   * 1 tablespoon kosher salt
   * 2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper
   * 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
   * 1 medium yellow onion, sliced
   * 6 cloves garlic, minced
   * 2 tablespoons Tuscan-Style Seasoning Blend (SEE RECIPE NOTES)
   * 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
   * 1 cup red wine or you can substitute with additional beef stock, or grape, pomegranate, or cranberry juice
   * 3 cup low-sodium beef stock
   * 2 cups baby carrots
   * 2 pounds baby red potatoes, cut in half or quarters if large
   * 2 tablespoons cornstarch
   * 1/4 cup water

***
**Instructions**

1. Cut the beef into 3-inch chunks and season with salt and pepper.

2. Warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large Dutch oven (or oven-safe heavy-bottomed pot) over medium-high heat. Once you can feel the heat when you hold your hand 6 inches above the pot, place the roast pieces in the pot. Brown the pieces on all sides, 2-3 minutes per side. (To get a good sear don't overcrowd the meat, you can sear the meat in batches). Don't skip this step. We are adding layers of flavor here. Once the roast is nicely seared with a good crust, remove it from the Dutch oven and place it in your slow cooker. (Use a 5 quart or larger slow cooker).

3. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the sliced onions to the Dutch oven and cook until the onions are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds. Sprinkle in the seasoning blend and add the Worcestershire sauce. Stir to combine. Pour in the wine (or additional beef stock of juice). Deglaze the pan by scraping up the browned bits at the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula as it bubbles. Pour in the beef stock. Stir to combine, and then add the contents of the pot into the slow cooker. Cover and cook for 5 hours on high (or 10 hours on low). Add the carrots and potatoes halfway through the cook time.

4. Remove the roast and vegetables from the slow cooker and place them on a serving dish. Tent with foil. Ladle the cooking liquid into a 4-quart saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Combine the cornstarch and water in a small bowl and whisk until completely smooth to create a slurry. Pour the slurry into the pot and stir. Boil the gravy until thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste for seasoning, and add salt and pepper as necessary.

5. Serve the pot roast and veggies with the gravy on the side.

**Recipe Notes**

Total time depends on if you are cooking this crockpot pot roast on high or low. I recommend cooking it on low for maximum tender and flavor. 

**Tuscan-Style Seasoning Blend**

   * 3 tablespoons dried rosemary
   * 3 tablespoons dried oregano
   * 3 tablespoons dried basil
   * 1 and 1/2 tablespoons dried thyme
   * 1 tablespoon dried marjoram
   * 1 and 1/2 teaspoons dried sage

Whisk all of the ingredients together and add TWO tablespoons to the pot roast. Store the remaining in a mason jar in a cool, dry, dark place.

***

**Ingredients**

   * 1 kg Cubed Beef
   * 5 Potatoes
   * Olive Oil
   * 350 mL of organic chicken or beef stock or 2 Chicken or Beef Bouillon Cubes 
   * 2 Large White Onions
   * 2 tsp Worcester Sauce
   * 2 tsp Soy Sauce
   * 3 Bay Leaves
   * ½ Tbsp Whole Cloves
   * ½ tsp ground cinnamon
   * 100 ml Apple Vinegar
   * 1 tsp Salt
   * 1 tsp Ground Black Pepper
   * Handful of Prunes
   * Handful of Dried Apricots
   * 1 Garlic Bulb
   * 2 cups Red Wine

***
**Directions**

1. Cube the beef and place them into a ziplock bag with 1 cup of flour and a pinch of salt. Shake so that the beef cubes become dusted in flour.

2. Add 2 shots of olive oil to a deep frying pan and heat over high flame.

3. Next you will be adding 2 handfuls of meat to the frying pan to brown the meat. To make sure the oil is hot enough drop in one cube of beef and wait to hear the cube of beef pop and sizzle in the oil, once this happens you can add the two handfuls of beef. Make sure that the pan is not too crowded with beef and that there is space between the beef cubes (see pictures). Stir occasionally as to not let the beef burn.

5. While the beef is cooking, dice the onions.

6. Once the beef cubes are browned move them to your deep cookware and move on to brown the remainder of the beef cubes.

7. Once all beef has been browned, capturing all the juicy flavors inside, then preheat the oven to 135℃ (275℉).

8. Add the onions and a shot of olive oil to the pan where the beef was frying to cook the onions in the meat juices. Stir the onions occasionally to avoid burning.

9. While the onions are cooking create a hot broth by dissolving the bouillon cubes in 350 ml of hot water or by heating the broth.

10. Once the onions begin to become translucent, add the hot broth to the onions.

11. Next, add Worcester sauce, soy sauce, 3 bay leaves, the cloves, and cinnamon. Made with Love Tip: Never forget the cinnamon! Mix the ingredients together and keep the flame on high for 5 minutes, allowing the sauce to condense.

12. After 5 minutes, add 100 ml of apple vinegar, salt, black pepper, prunes, garlic, and the wine.

13. Once the mixture boils, pour it onto the meat in the ceramic basin and cover with an aluminum sheet.

14. Place the dish, covered, in the oven to allow to cook for 2 hours.

15. Serve hot and feel free to accompany your Stifado, with the following sides: Baked potato, Sweet Carrots, Garlic and Lemon Green Beans

7rqsl4,What's your method of choice to make beef stock from scratch?,3,5,1516460045.0,0.8,Beef,Miss_Behaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/7rqsl4/whats_your_method_of_choice_to_make_beef_stock/,"I get bones and oxtail from the Chinese market. Bones cost about $1/#. Tail is closer to $4/#. I get a pound of each and maybe a 1-2# chunk of some real grisly beef cut if I want it to be extra beefy. The bones make for the texture, the meat makes the flavor, the grisle makes fat which you can use for cooking later. Roast them in the oven along with a peeled onion at 400 for 30 min. Then they go in a Dutch oven and get covered with salted water. 
From here I go in two possible directions. For onion soup or beef and veg stew I’ll add carrots, celery, bay leaves, thyme, and maybe garlic. Or for pho I’ll add ginger, garlic, cinnamon stick, star anise, and maybe a charred lemon. 
The whole thing goes into the oven with the lid on. Set the temp to about 215 and leave it for 6-12 hours. You can pull the veg out after 6 hours, but the bones will keep giving up texture the whole time. 
When it’s done and rested on the counter top for 20 minutes I pull out the big stuff with tongs and strain out the rest into a big bowl. It goes into the fridge until the fat separates and solidifies. 
Pull the meat off of the oxtail and give it a little salt. It’s amazing stuff. 
For onion soup: salt a couple pounds of white onions in the beef fat right back in the Dutch in the oven at 350. Give them a stir every 10 min so they don’t char. When they are soft and brown add the beef stock and oxtail meat if you didn’t eat it already. Simmer on the stove for a bit.

Servings: 8 - 10 people

**Ingredients**

   * 1.5 – 2 kg / 3 – 4 lb beef brisket 
   * 1 tbsp olive oil (or a neutral oil like vegetable, canola)

**Rub:**

   * 1 tbsp brown sugar
   * 2 tsp paprika powder
   * 1 tsp onion powder
   * 1 tsp garlic powder
   * 1/2 tsp cumin powder
   * 3/4 tsp mustard powder
   * 1 tsp salt
   * 1/2 tsp black pepper

**BBQ Sauce:**

   * 2 garlic cloves , minced
   * 1/2 cup / 125 ml apple cider vinegar
   * 1 1/2 cups / 375 ml ketchup
   *1/2 cup / 110g brown sugar , packed
   * 2 tsp EACH black pepper , onion powder, mustard powder
   * 1 tsp cayenne pepper (adjust to taste re: spiciness)
   * 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

***
**Instructions**

1. Place Rub in a bowl and mix to combine.
    
2. Rub all over brisket with your hands. If time permits, leave for 30 minutes – 24 hours in the fridge, but I rarely do this.
    
3. Combine BBQ Sauce ingredients in a slow cooker. Mix then add the brisket – squish it in if needed, like I did (see video).
    
4. Slow cook in slow cooker for 8 hours (1.5 kg / 3 lb) to 10 hours (2 kg / 4 lb). (Note 2 for other methods)
    
5. Remove brisket onto a tray.
    
6. Pour liquid in slow cooker into a saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium high heat and reduce until it thickens to a syrup consistency (it thickens more as it cools).

7. Meanwhile, drizzle brisket with oil then roast in a 200C/390F oven for 15 minutes until brown spots appear. Remove then baste generously with Sauce, then return to oven for 5 minutes. Remove and baste again, then return to oven for 5 – 10 minutes until it caramelizes and looks like the photos. 

8. **BBQ OPTION** instead of oven - fantastic char grilled flavour: Brush grills with oil, then preheat BBQ to medium high. Place beef on the grills and leave until browned, then turn the beef over and brown the other side. Baste the beef generously and turn, then baste again. Do this repeatedly until there is a nice caramelized glaze on the brisket, then remove.

9. **TO SERVE:** Slice brisket thinly across the grain and serve with remaining BBQ Sauce. This is terrific served as a meal with sides or piled high onto rolls with Coleslaw as sliders.

An unholy amalgamation of Jewish and Texas style briskets. Will literally knock your Bubby and Zaidy unconscious.

**YIELDS A lot - TOTAL TIME 12-18 Hours**


**INGREDIENTS**

**Spice Rub** 

* 1 Tbsp Kosher Salt 
* 2 Tbsp Brown Sugar 
* 2 Tbsp Ground Black Pepper 
* 2 Tbsp Chili Powder 
* 2 Tbsp Red Pepper Flakes (can be lowered if you're a yellow bellied coward) 
* 2 Tbsp Paprika 
* 1 Tsp Cumin 
* 1 Tsp Cayenne Pepper 
* 1 Tsp Garlic Powder 
* 1 Tsp Onion Powder

**For The Roasting Pan**

* 1 5-12 pound Brisket with most of the fat cap removed
* 1 Big old onion
* 2 Cans of Gingerale
* 2 Cups or so of water

**A DIGITAL PROBE STYLE MEAT THERMOMETER IS ESSENTIAL**

**INSTRUCTIONS**

**1.** Most important thing for this recipe is TIME. Plan your cooking in advance for the love of god, especially if you are cooking for multiple people. For instance, I cooked a 10 lb brisket for a party and it took nearly 20 hours to finish using my method. Its not annoying or a pain, it just means you can't be an idiot. For that brisket, I started it the night before I wanted to serve around 9:00 PM. Trust me, it takes a while to cook.

**2.** Preheat your oven to 225 degrees fahrenheit while you prep your brisket.On a decent sized working surface, coat your hands in vegetable oil of any kind and really rub down the brisket like you work in a dodgy massage parlour. Then start adding that delicious rub everywhere. The reason we use veggie oil over other liquid is that many of the spices we used are OIL soluble as opposed to WATER soluble. This releases more of the spices intended flavour. Coat the entire brisket, fat cap and all as well as every nook and cranny and work the rub in. Don't throw the excess rub away.

**3.** Cut the large onion into thick slices and line the bottom of your roasting pan so the brisket has a little bed of kindness to cook on. Throw the extra rub on top of it.

**4.** Place the brisket FAT SIDE DOWN in the roasting pan. Pour the 2 cans of gingerale down the sides of the roasting pan so it gently fills up from the bottom. You don't want to wash off all that work you did getting the top side properly seasoned. You want the liquid to come about half way up the meat. IF you need to add water, do so. Otherwise this sucker is ready.

**5.** Insert your meat probe into the thickest part of the beef (and for the love of god, make sure the probe is oven safe cause its going to be in there a long time). Pop it into the oven UNCOVERED for the first 6-9 hours of cooking. This develops that nice crust on the top and lets some of juice reduce.

**6.** After the first 6-9 hours (where you hopefully slept) you will wake up to an incredible smell in your house and rush to the oven to see what temp it's at. This is where you start freaking out because ""HOLY CRAP, it's cooking too fast!!"" The thermometer may read anywhere between 150-175. Don't Panic. The first stage of brisket cooking is very rapid, until it hits the stall. This is a brisket inevitability. Your end game is 195 degrees internal temperature and its going to take it's sweet time getting there. Let it. I promise it's worth it.

**7** Your brisket has hit 195 internal, take a fork and test it by sticking it into the meat and twisting. If its soft and delicious, then you're done!
Take it out of the oven and cover the entire roasting pan in towels and let it rest for an hour. Then you can slice it, shred it, do whatever. It will be a hit at your next party or get together or you can punch me in the face.

7h5lfg,Coconut-braised Short Ribs,5,1,1512252043.0,0.73,Beef,RaddIce,https://i.redd.it/c91lc3rozk101.jpg,"Short ribs and another braised recipe…but slow cooking turns these tough cuts of beef into succulent perfection. This time around I used a braising liquid with coconut milk, tons of sambal oelek (garlic chili sauce) and red curry paste. Alongside the soft, fatty ribs is a quick chili peanut sauce and rice.

A note about braising and why you need to use this slow cooking method. Braising is a combination-cooking method where the meat is first seared at a high temperature, then finished in a covered pot at a lower temperature while in braising liquid. The hours of low heat transforms the meat’s collagen into gelatin, which results in a silky, flavor-packed sauce. Braising is used traditionally to turn lesser cuts of meat into delicious dishes, which is why the technique is utilized in many cultures.

**Ingredients**

* 3 lbs short ribs
* 1 can full-fat coconut milk
* 2 TBSP sambal oelek (garlic chili sauce)
* 1 TBSP red curry paste
* ½ TBSP rice wine vinegar

Garlic, however much you like
You can add peppers and other veggies if you like but keep in mind all veggies should be cooked with the ground beef, drained and waiting

6laug5,Thai style Rib-Eye with Dipping Sauce (recipe in comments!),324,5,1499215445.0,0.93,Beef,DrummingChopsticks,https://i.redd.it/w6efvqlo7o7z.jpg,"[Recipe Link (via Bellyfull Life)](https://www.bellyfullife.com/thai-style-rib-eye-aka-crying-tiger/) 

Super good recipe I just tried out for our Fourth of July BBQ, everyone ate it up quick!  [Bonus shot of cut meat before we dove in](http://imgur.com/wGvFnRB). 

But the recipe isn't mine. Credit goes to [Bellyfull Life](https://www.bellyfullife.com/) .

Recipe cut and paste below: 

Servings: 1 rib-eye is good for 1 hungry person or 2 adults.  Scale accordingly.

Time: 45 minutes.  15 minutes active time prepping and cooking, 30 minutes of marinating time

Ingredients: 

**Steak**

* 1 ribeye steak, with or without the bone based on preference.  Final steak is sliced for serving.
* Lawry’s Garlic Salt
* Golden Mountain Sauce, at least 10 bottle shakes per steak
* 1 tbsp of butter for cooking the steak if you are cooking on a regular pan, not needed from cast iron

**Sauce**

* 2.5 tbsp of lime juice – this is about the juice from 1 medium lime.  Since this sauce is all about balance, I encourage you to measure the lime juice so you hit the right flavor combo.
* 2 tbsp of fish sauce
* 2 tbsp of granulated sugar (white sugar)
* 1 stalk of chopped green onion, both green and white parts
* 1 medium shallot, thinly sliced
* 1-2 tsp of Thai chili flakes or regular chili flakes

**OPTIONAL for serving**

* Lettuce – fresh and crunchy lettuce of any kind is great to serve on the side.

Thai steamed sticky rice – how to cook it yourself is for another post.  If you have access to a Thai take out place that has it, get an order!

Steps:

* Layout steak onto a plate or surface for marinate.
* Generously sprinkle the garlic salt on the steak first.  Pat it down and rub into the meat on both sides.
* Coat the steak next with Golden Mountain Sauce.  It’s about 3-5 shakes of the bottle to get enough on the surface.  Rub into the meat on both sides to make sure there is an even coating.  Marinate for 30 minutes in room temperature if you preparing right away.  Otherwise, you can marinate it up to a day in advance and store in fridge. 
* Prepare the sauce while the steak is marinating.  Combine lime juice, fish sauce and sugar into a small bowl.  Stir with a small spoon until the sugar is dissolved.
* Stir in green onion and shallots to the sauce.
* Add chili flakes to desired spiciness.  1/2 tsp is a good starting point and add from there to increase spiciness.  Set aside.
* When your steak is done marinating, heat your pan on high until very hot.
* Place steak onto pan when ready.  For medium rare, cook about 3.5-4 minutes on each side.  My steaks  were 1 inch thick, you can adjust the cook time accordingly depending on preference.
* After steaks are done cooking, let rest on a cutting board or plate for at least 5 minutes before slicing.  Resting the steak will give you a more tender and juicy steak.  Without resting, you’ll have a runny mess of steak juices everywhere.
* Slice off bone and reserve for serving and munching on later.
* Cut steak into thin 1/4 inch slices.
* Serve immediately with dipping sauce on the side.

**Ingredients**

&gt;* 1.5 kg stewing beef, such as chuck or top rump, trimmed and cut into 7cm pieces
* 24 baby onions
* 4 ripe tomatoes , or 1 x 400g tin of chopped tomatoes

**Directions**

&gt;1. Place the beef in a large non-reactive bowl. Add the marinade ingredients, peeling and finely slicing the garlic first, then cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or preferably overnight.
2. Peel the baby onions. If using fresh, peel and roughly chop the tomatoes.
3. Heat the oil over medium heat in a large saucepan and sauté the onions for 5 minutes or until softened. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
4. Sauté the beef, reserving the marinade, for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until browned on all sides.

I've seen recipes include cornstarch in taco seasoning mix - I assume to make something that ""coats"" the meat with a very thin layer of ""sauce"", rather than just sticking to or absorbing into the meat. (This would make a seasoning you would need to cook with meat - if you sprinkled it on something ""raw"", you'd taste the cornstarch.) Given your current proportions, you could try adding 3 to 4 parts cornstarch.

Alton Brown's taco seasoning includes hot smoked paprika - one of the few significant variations in taco seasoning I found.

(Meaning sprinkle heavily with a coarse salt and let it sit on the counter for 2 hours)  if grilling is available I reccommend putting it on full blast and putting the steaks over high heat. Also including a pan with water under the grill lid will make it tender. 

There are several methods to determine your preferred doneness including temperature checks and using you hand. If you touch the tip of your thumb to the tip of your other fingers one by one you'll create a scale of doneness. First finger is rare and pinky is well. You touch two fingers and then use your other hand to poke the fleshy base of the thumb. Like on the palm. 

Some people rinse the salt off before grilling some don't.  Some people use seasonings while on the grill some don't.  

Be sure to let it rest when you pull it off the grill. I usually do 5 minutes.

If you'd rather do something a bit less greasy, I like an all beef meatloaf with plenty of sauteed vegetables (and milk soaked bread). 
I mostly use the 1770 House Meatloaf recipe that Ina Garten has shown on her tv show, and only sometimes use the meatloaf mix (equal parts beef, pork and veal) called for. 
I scale the recipe down, use a pound of beef, one egg, etc. It makes nice meatballs too. 

And if you're in the mood for even more vegetables in your meatloaf, substitute some well browned mushrooms for a bit of the beef. (chop them up very fine)

**Prepare the potatoes:**

1. While the pork fries, place the potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 20–25 minutes or until fork tender. Scoop out ¼ cup of the potato water, drain the potatoes, and return them to the pot. Keep warm.

**Cook the aromatics:**

**Sauté the cabbage:**

1. Add the chopped cabbage to the leeks and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Cook for 5–7 minutes.

1.1 lbs Pork shoulder minced (500g) you can use turkey instead

* 4 Bacon slices
* 2 Sweetheart Cabbage or 1 Savoy Cabbage
* 1.5 cups Vegetable broth (375ml) Poultry broth works as well
* 3 Medium onions finely diced
* 1 tbsp Vegetable oil
* 2 tbsp Breadcrumbs
* 0.44 lbs Long grain rice (200g) this yields about 1.3 lbs or 600g when cooked; pearl barley is a good substitute as well
* 2 tsp Salt (12g)
* 1 tsp Black pepper

**Instructions:**

1.Cook the rice, then drain and mix with the minced meat. In a pan, sauté the onions in oil until they turn golden. Add to the meat and rice mixture. Incorporate salt, pepper, and breadcrumbs. Combine thoroughly.

2.Prepare large pot, pour water up to 1/3 of its height and boil it.

* **For Sweetheart or Savoy Cabbage:** Simply blanch the leaves in boiling water for 2 minutes. Trim the thick nerve in the middle of each leaf.
* **For White Cabbage:** Removing the hardest part of the stem with a knife. Place the cabbage in boiling water, after two minutes, turn the leaves upside down and wait for another 2-3 minutes before removing. You can start rolling while waiting for the cabbage. Reserve the smallest leaves and core part for laying the baking dish.

3.Make a ball of meat &amp; rice stuffing in your hands and transfer it to a leaf. Place it at the bottom part of the leaf. Fold the leaf sides toward the centre. Roll the cabbage roll tightly. Roll all cabbage rolls until you run out of stuffing.

**4.**

* **For the stovetop method:** Using the pot previously employed for blanching the cabbage, layer the bottom with bacon slices followed by smaller cabbage leaves. Position the rolls on top, add the broth, cover the pot, and allow it to simmer gently for approximately 1.5 hours.
* **Oven-baked method:** In a Dutch oven or another oven-safe dish, arrange bacon slices and small leftover cabbage leaves at the base. Position the rolls snugly next to each other. After covering, bake in an oven that's been preheated to 180°C (356°F) for 50 minutes. Then, uncover the dish, drizzle your preferred sauce (either tomato or mushroom) over the rolls, and continue baking for an additional 20 minutes.
* **Slow-cooker method:** In your slow cooker, begin by layering bacon slices and smaller cabbage leaves. Add a thin coating of tomato sauce to avoid the Gołąbki sticking, then systematically layer the Gołąbki, covering them with the remaining sauce and topping with additional cabbage leaves. Set to cook on low for 6 hours or, if short on time, on high for 3 hours. When finished, exercise caution when removing the tender Gołąbki.

**5.** Serve the cabbage rolls immediately after cooking. Sprinkle with freshly chopped dill, parsley or ton of black pepper, serve with you favourite sauce. Smacznego!

**Ingredients:**

* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced
* 4 tablespoons butter, divided
* 5 scallions, minced; white and green parts kept separate
* 1 cup carnaroli or arborio rice
* 6 cups warm water or chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 pound broccoli, cut into florets
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
* ¾ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
* ½ lemon, juiced
* 4 boneless, thick-sliced center-cut pork chops (1 pound total)
* Freshly minced parsley, optional, for serving
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the risotto:**

1. Preheat the oven to 425ºF.
2. Turn the heat on a large pot to medium. Add the mushrooms and cook, occasionally turning as they release water. The water will evaporate over 8–10 minutes. Once the water from the mushrooms evaporates, turn the heat to medium-high and add 2 tablespoons of butter. Cook for 4-5 minutes until they brown and crisp up around the edges. Add salt and pepper.
3. Add the scallion whites to the mushrooms. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the carnaroli rice and cook for 1–2 minutes. Add a pinch of salt. *\*See Note*
4. Begin ladling in the warm water or stock, 1 cup at a time. Stir after each addition and only add more liquid once the rice absorbs the liquid in the pot. Continue adding the liquid until 5 cups have been incorporated. Taste the risotto to see if the rice is tender. The liquid in the pot should be creamy. Add the remaining 1 cup of water only if needed and stir after adding it. Taste and add salt and pepper. This process will take 20–25 minutes.
5. Once the rice is tender, turn off the heat. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, half of the minced scallion greens, and the Parmesan cheese until melted. Add the lemon juice. Taste and season once more.

**Roast the broccoli:**

1. Arrange the broccoli florets on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.
2. As soon as you add the carnaroli rice to the pot for the risotto, transfer the broccoli to the oven. Roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover with foil. Keep warm and keep the oven heated to 425ºF.

**Cook the pork chops:**

1. Pat the pork chops dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops and cook for 3–4 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven for 15–17 minutes. Once the pork chops reach 140ºF, remove them from the oven and rest on a cutting board for 5–10 minutes.
3. Slice the pork chops thinly and arrange on a serving platter with the roasted broccoli.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the risotto into shallow bowls. Arrange the sliced pork chop on top and serve with the broccoli on the side. Garnish with freshly minced parsley and the remaining minced scallion greens. Enjoy!

Notes:

Continue with roasting the broccoli and the pork chops as you cook the risotto. While you should stir the risotto regularly, you can take breaks periodically to roast the broccoli and fry up the pork chops.

14rhyxq,XO Noodles with Pork,427,3,1688579393.0,0.97,Pork,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/9rrodzzbp6ab1.jpg,"**Recipe here originally: [XO Noodles with Pork](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/xo-noodles-with-pork/)**

**Ingredients**

* 1 pound ground pork
* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 12 ounces chow mein or lo mein noodles
* 1 shallot, peeled and thinly sliced
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1-inch piece of ginger, peeled and minced
* 3 Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced
* 4 scallions, trimmed and minced
* 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, caps thinly sliced; stems discarded or saved or stock
* 4 cups shredded Napa cabbage, cored and shredded
* 2 cups grated carrots
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 2 heaping tablespoons XO sauce
* ½ cup water or chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine
* 1 teaspoon cornstarch
* Crispy shallots, optional, for garnish
* 2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced into long slivers, optional, for garnish
* Neutral oil, as needed

**Brown the pork:**

1. Turn the heat on a skillet to medium-high. Add the pork and cook, breaking it up as it cooks, for 12–15 minutes until nicely browned. Continue cooking until the pork deepens in color and crisps up around the edges. You want crispy bits!
2. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the skillet.
3. Mix together 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine, and sugar. Pour the mixture into the pork. Bring to a boil and cook for 2–3 minutes, lifting up anything stuck to the bottom. Transfer the pork to a large bowl.

**Cook the noodles:**

1. While the pork browns, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain, rinse, and set aside.

**Cook the aromatics:**

1. Keep the heat on the skillet at medium-high. Add the shallot, garlic, ginger, Thai chili peppers, and minced scallions. Sauté for 1–2 minutes until fragrant. Transfer to the bowl of pork.

**Cook the mushrooms:**

1. If needed, add a touch of oil. Add the mushrooms to the skillet and sauté them for 5–6 minutes over medium-high heat. Be careful with shiitakes. They have a lower water content than other mushrooms and can dry out very quickly! Once lightly golden brown, transfer the mushrooms to the bowl of pork.

**Cook the cabbage and carrots:**

1. Add the cabbage and carrots (in batches, if needed) to the skillet. Sauté over medium-high heat until the cabbage wilts and the carrots soften about 5–6 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Transfer the cabbage and carrots to the bowl of pork.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Add 2 teaspoons of sesame oil to the skillet. Add the XO sauce and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the water, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine. Bring to a boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
2. Scoop out a tablespoon or so of the sauce. Whisk it together with the cornstarch until a slurry forms.
3. Return the cornstarch mixture to the sauce and stir to incorporate. Continue simmering for 3–5 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed. If you like saucier noodles, add more water, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine in 3:1:1 proportions. You may need more cornstarch to thicken it if you add more liquid. You can also add more XO sauce for an even richer sauce.

**Finish the noodles:**

1. Add the noodles to the skillet along with all but a few tablespoons of the pork mixture. Toss to combine over low heat until the noodles are warmed through, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Don’t let them cook on the heat too long! Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the noodles between shallow bowls. Spoon a bit more of the pork and veggie mixture on each dish. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions and crispy shallots if you like.

**Ingredients**  


* 600 g Pork Shoulder chopped into 3/4 inch cubes
* 1 tbsp Light Soy Sauce
* 2 Eggs beaten
* 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1 cup Cornstarch
* Canola Oil for frying
* 2 Scallions finely sliced

**Sweet and Sour Sauce**  


* 1.5 cups Orange Juice
* 4 tbsp White Sugar
* 3 tbsp Tomato Paste
* 4 tbsp Ketchup
* 5 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar
* 1 Red Bell Pepper roughly chopped
* 1 Spanish Onion roughly chopped
* 1.5 cups Pineapple Chunks
* 4 tbsp Cornstarch mixed with 6 tbsp water  


**Instructions**  


1. Place the pork chunks in a large bowl, add the beaten egg, soy sauce and salt and mix well, ensuring all the pork is coated in the egg mixture.
2. Tip the cornstarch into a seperate bowl then add the pork and stir to coat in cornstarch, shaking off any excess.
3. Fill a wok 2/3 full of oil and heat to 350 F. Fry the pork pieces in batches for about 2 to 3 minutes, or when they just start to get golden brown. Remove them from the oil and transfer to a sheet pan with a slotted spoon.
4. In a large saucepan over medium high heat, add 1 tbsp or oil, red bell pepper and onion. Sautee for 3-4 minutes until slightly tender but still crunchy.
5. Add the orange juice, white sugar, tomato paste, ketchup, vinegar and pineapple chunks. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Slowly stir in the cornstarch slurry, stirring continuously, until you have the desired consistency. Add water to thin out the sauce if required. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Set aside.
7. Once you’re ready to combine everything, refry the pork in batches to crisp up the coating. Frying the pork twice prevents it from getting too soggy when added to the sauce.
8. Add the deep fried pork to the sauce and toss to coat.

2. In a large pot or Dutch Oven over medium high heat cook the pork belly chunks. Let sear on all sides until browned and crispy. Discard rendered fat. Set cooked pork belly aside.
3. Heat the oil in the same pot over medium low heat until it shimmers. Add all of the paste, breaking it up with a wooden spoon and stirring occasionally, until it's fragrant, 2-3 minutes.
4. Stir in the shallots and cook until slightly softened, about 3 minutes, then add the curry powder and turmeric and stir frequently for a minute. Add the pork shoulder, stir to coat the pork, and cook for a few minutes.
5. Stir in the fish sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar. Increase the heat slightly to bring the liquid to a simmer, cook until the sugar dissolves, then add the tamarind along with 2 cups of water. Increase the heat to high, let the liquid come to a strong simmer, then immediately decrease the heat to low and cover, cooking for 45 minutes.
6. Remove the lid and stir in the ginger and cook at a steady simmer until the pork shoulder is very tender, approximately 45 more minutes.
7. Stir in the pickled garlic cloves and chili, cook for 10 minutes then stir in the long beans, Thai basil and pork belly, cook until they're tender and slightly crunchy, about 5 minutes. Let the curry cool to warm and season with brown sugar or fish sauce to taste.
8. Serve in a large bowl topped with fried shallots.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1094e6g/gaeng_hung_lay_burmese_pork_belly_curry_with_long/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1094e6g/gaeng_hung_lay_burmese_pork_belly_curry_with_long/

**EQUIPMENT**

* Steamer (a bamboo steamer or a large metal pot steamer)
* 12 parchment paper squares (cut into 3 X 3 inches)
* 1/2 cup vinegar for steaming

**INGREDIENTS**

**Dough**

* 1 package of Kim Tu Thap (Bot Banh Bao) with yeast
* 1 cup warm milk
* ½ cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 tbsp oil
* 1 tbsp white vinegar

**Filling**

* ¾ lbs ground pork (fatty ground pork is okay)
* 3 tbsp wood ear mushroom
* ½ cup of onion
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp fish sauce
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1 tsp sugar
* ½ tsp salt
* 1/8 tsp black pepper
* 2 Chinese sausage links, thinly sliced
* 12 quail eggs, cooked and peeled

**INSTRUCTIONS**

**Making the premix dough**

1. Mix the warm milk with the yeast from the banh bao package. Let it sit and work its magic for 10 minutes. If you are using a stand mixer you can add these ingredients to the mixer bowl.
2. Once the yeast has worked its magic add oil and vinegar and add the mixer attachment. In a medium-sized bowl mix the dry ingredients together, the flour, sugar and salt.
3. Swap the attachment to the dough hook and add the dry ingredients and mix on low first and gradually increase the speed to medium-low. I let it work the dough until it's well mixed. Roughly 2 minutes. Avoid over-kneading in the mixer to create a light and fluffy bao.
4. Add a small pinch of flour to a clean surface. Take the dough out of the bowl and use your hands to knead the dough using the palm of your hands. Continues until the dough is nice and smooth. Let it sit for 1 hour to allow it to rise. Best to place it somewhere warm.

**Prepare the pork filling, quail eggs and Chinese sausage**

1. Boil the quail eggs until they are cooked and peel. Set aside.
2. Take 2 sausages and slice them at an angle to get a nice oval-shaped sausage. I cut them roughly 1/8 inch. Set aside.
3. Take the ground pork, add the wood ear mushrooms, onion, sesame oil, fish sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, salt and black pepper. Mix it well and set aside to marinade for about 10 minutes.
4. Portion out 12 pork fillings and roll them into a ball and set aside.

**Assembling the bao**

1. Once the dough has doubled in size take the dough and divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Use a scale to portion out evenly.
2. Using a rolling pin to roll out a circle roughly 3.5-4 inches wide. Place the pork filling, quail egg and 2-3 slices of Chinese sausage in the center.
3. Two ways to pleat the bao:

***Method 1 (more work but looks cute)***

1. Using your primary hand form a small fold with your thumb and index finger. Hold the fold and using your opposite hand place your thumb underneath and your index finger on top and push the dough towards the fold to form the second pleat. You are looking to make an accordion fold. Continue forming these pleats while at the same time rotating the bao until you reach the end.
2. There will likely be a hole at the top. Using both hands gently close the hole by squeezing it close.
3. Give it a gentle twirl and that’s it!
4. Place on top of parchment paper square.

***Method 2 (quick and easy but not as pretty)***

1. Grab the opposite ends and bring the dough together over the filling.
2. On the opposite sides that bring the other sides over. It’s like wrapping the filling up
3. Using both hands seal the center, making sure there are no openings.
4. Place the bao on top of parchment paper square .

**Steaming**

1. Prepare the steamer by adding water and ½ cup white vinegar. Make sure to add enough water to steam multiple batches if your steamer is smaller. I steam in 2 batches.
2. Once the water is boiling turn the heat to medium-high and add the baos. Steam for 20 minutes per batch.

**Note:** Using premix Banh Bao flour yields fluffy bao. I also have a homemade dough recipe which can be found on the link above if you are not able to find the premix flour in the store.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z0ip7d/vietnamese_steamed_pork_buns_banh_bao/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z0ip7d/vietnamese_steamed_pork_buns_banh_bao/

* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 3 tablespoons water, divided
* cooking oil
* 3-4 tablespoons fish sauce (more or less to taste)
* 3 cups fresh coconut juice (about 2 coconuts)
* 6 eggs (more or less to your liking)

DIRECTIONS:

1. Slice pork belly into 1-inch thick (or slightly thicker) pieces. In a bowl, toss the pork with crushed garlic, shallots, salt and pepper. Set aside at room temperature for 10-20 minutes.
2. In a small saucepan, add 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of water. Bring to a boil, the sugar will fully dissolve. Lower the heat to medium, continue to simmer.

Keep watching closely, until it has a dark caramel color, turn off the heat and carefully add 1 tablespoon of water. Swirl the saucepan (or stir) to combine and remove it from the stove. Set aside.
3. Place a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat and add a small amount of cooking oil. Once the oil is hot, add the pork belly, along with all the crushed garlic and shallots, and the caramel sauce. Stir and cook to coat the pork with the caramel sauce and then add fish sauce. Continue to stir and cook.
4. Once the outside of the pork is no longer pink, add coconut juice enough to cover the meat. Bring it to a boil and skim off all the foams, then lower to a simmer.Cover the pot with the lid slightly askew and simmer until the pork is almost tender to your liking (about 75-80 minutes). You can give everything a stir once in a while for even cooking if you want.
5. While braising the pork belly, boil the eggs so that they are just about to reach hard-boiled. Place the eggs in cold water to cool down, and then peel them.
6. Once the pork is almost tender, add the eggs (make sure they are surrounded with the braising liquid). Cover and simmer for about 10 more minutes.
7. Transfer the caramelized pork belly and eggs along with the sauce to a shallow serving plate.

We made a feast and it was a bit of pain, but overall, I feel like this pork roast was one of the best mesh of flavors I've ever had:  
**Spit-Roasted Pork**

* Serving Size - 150g of Meat
* 8 Servings
* Prep Time - 4 hours
* Cook Time - 1 hour
* Wait Time - 20 minutes
* Total Time - 5.5 hours  


**Ingredients**  
**Brine**

* Boneless Pork Roast
* 2 cups of Water
* 2 tbsp of Sea Salt
* 2 tbsp of honey  


**Rub**

* 2 tbsp, ground black pepper
* 3 tbsp, ground Rue
* 2 tbsp, ground coriander seed
* 2 tbsp, Fenugreek seeds

  
**Glaze**

* 1/2 cup Red Wine Vinegar
* 1/2 cup of honey

**Instructions**

1. Rinse and pat dry the pork roast.
2. Combine water, sea salt and honey in a stock pot until it is all dissolved. Once dissolved; submerge the pork roast under brine.
3. Once submerged, cover and refrigerate for 3-7 hours.
4. While the pork is in the brine, take the rub ingredients and grind them together. We use a mortar and pestle because it's more accurate, but feel free to use a spice grinder.
5. Once completed, mix the glaze ingredients together.
6. One hour before cooking, take the pork loin out of the fridge. Remove from brine and pat dry.
7. Once the pork is dried, score the fat on the roast to a 1"" diamond shape.
8. Take half of the rub and rub into the meat, including into the crevices of the scores.
9. Take the remaining rub at add it to the glaze mixture. I put the glaze directly into the honey bottle, so I would shake it up periodically before I glazed.
10. Place a drip pan where you expect the pork to be. Start the grill or fire, placing the coals on both sides of the pan. Get the grill or fire to 250f degrees; then place the pork into the spit.
11. Place the pork over the spit, suspended about 6 to 8 inches above the coals.
12. Cook the pork for 1 hour, rotating every 10-25 minutes. Anytime we rotated it, I brushed on the glaze. The pork roast should hit an internal temperature of 165f.
13. Once completed, remove from heat and spit. Allow it to rest for 15 minutes before cutting.  


**Notes**

* We only brined for 3 hours, so we did the NOT recommended decision to leave the pork on the counter. As a reminder, food outside of refrigeration for long periods can lead to food-borne illnesses. We had decided since we were brining for less time than ideal, that getting it to room temperature earlier would be best.

We did a bunch of research about food that a mix-gendered group would be able to have at feast in Ancient Greece. We had a blast putting this together, but we're both ready to move on from there. I recommend using Rue - It's such an interesting herb, but it's a bit difficult to find in some circles. I had to get it from Etsy from an herbal shop.

Recipe lightly modified from here: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/scotcheggs\_85851](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/scotcheggs_85851)

**Ingredients:**

For the sausage meat:

\- 1lb lean minced pork

\- 20g Stuffing Mix (Bland as possible so American style preferably. I used Stove Top pork)- Freshly ground Pepper

\- 2 tsp fresh thyme

\- 1 tsp parsley flakes

\- 1 tsp sage

\- 2 small shallots, very finely chopped

&amp;#x200B;

For the scotch eggs:

\- 6 medium eggs

\- 80g plain flower, seasoned with salt and pepper

\- 1 egg beaten

\- 3 slices of white bread, lightly toasted then ground into breadcrumbs

\- vegetable oil, for frying

&amp;#x200B;

**Method**

\- Combine all the ingredients for the sausage meat together in a medium bowl, mix thoroughly. Meat can be covered and stored in fridge for later use.

\- Place the eggs, unbroken, in cold salted water. Bring to the boil then immediately reduce tempreature and simmer for 9 min. (You may have to do this in stages, if so you only need to let the water cool to warm between batches)

\- When the eggs are finished strain and cool under running water. Then peel off the shells, if you haven't done this before I recommend looking up a video, fingernails help.

\- Take the sausage meet and divide into sixths on a clean cutting board, before flattening each into a shallow oval \~1/4"" thick.

\- Spread the seasoned flower onto a large plate. One at a time take a peeled egg and dredge it in flower until a thin coating sticks to all surfaces, before placing the egg at the center of the flattened sausage meat, and wrapping the meat around it and gently rolling to form a smooth egg shaped ball.

\- Prepare the breadcrumbs, I used a stick blender and a tall cup to get them fine enough. Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate. One at a time coat the meat wrapped eggs in the beaten egg mixture before rolling in bread crumbs enough to ensure a even coating on all surfaces.

\- With all the eggs prepared select a high walled pot and fill with oil, quantity will vary based on pot selection but ideally should be enough to completely submerge the prepared egg. **Important:** Do not fill the pot anywhere near to full, remember when you place eggs in the oil level will rise and we do not want it to boil over. Heat the oil until a loose breadcrumb placed in it will bubble and brown in around 30s. (I found this was around 370F)

\- The eggs will be cooked for \~9 min in the hot oil. I suggest using a slotted spoon to place and remove them. I encourage you to monitor the oil tempreature yourself, either by thermometer or look and feel and suggest you open up the first egg cooked and determine if any adjustments need to be made. It will all be relative to your setup but I cooked the eggs two at a time on alternating cycles, one egg removed every four and a half minutes, my oil temperature remained fairly constant at \~320F, and I rotated the eggs twice to ensure even cooking.

\- **Important:** Usual safety precautions when working with hot oil apply, always use long implements to place eggs into the oil preferably from the side of the pot. Be aware of the temperament of the oil, sizzling is good bubbling is worrying. Be aware of the level of the oil as you add and remove the eggs. Finally as I was working in a small pot I took the step of turning off the gas every time I added a egg to prevent risk of flare up if the oil overflowed.

\- When the eggs are finished place them on a sheet of kitchen roll to absorb excess oil. Personal preference is to serve chilled or at room temperature, though they can be eaten warm after allowing some time to cool.  


  
**Improvements**  
This is probably the simplest least creative recipe for scotch eggs out there, I was deliberately aiming for generic. It does however make it completely open to adaptation/improvement. If I were to make it again I would definitely attempt to address the slightly bland breadcrumbs, I suspect the answer may be more salt but I also want to see if some herbs (perhaps sage) add some complexity to the flavor.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/q1olns/scotch_eggs/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/q1olns/scotch_eggs/
nvxz0x,Braised Pork Rice Bowl Recipe - Melt in your Mouth!,2359,66,1623250842.0,0.99,Pork,cookingwithRobin,https://i.redd.it/rt7ww7m989471.jpg,"as someone who has been playing around with this type of dish a while now (and love it, please everyone give this a try its so comforting), i will warn that depending on the recipe you use, some may find it too salty, while others will be fine - when im in taiwan some places serve a version that is very potent and delicious, and served a different sauce to rice ratio because the flavors stretch out that long. So you'll find a range of flavor strengths that cater to how much else you may be eating with it!

Other versions (i believe northern taiwan is more towards this) use just minced pork and may add in pork fat/skin portions to their own tastes, and these versions also taste absolutely delicious - dont feel worried if you cant find pork belly.

Personally, i love it served with any pickle! traditional pickled mustard greens, soy pickled cucumbers, kimchi, viet sweet pickled radishes and carrots, pickled red onions - i dont actually love pickles, but with a dish as luxurious and rich as this, i think it elevates to a new level.

Tea eggs are also a classic, but i sometimes just love an over-easy egg cracked on top of it.

Thank you OP for reminding me of this gem of a dish, im going to make it again next week. This week i made a somewhat similar chicken dish version of this called "" Ji Rou Fan.""

Edit: Oh my gosh how could i forget, this sauce is SO versatile. It doesnt just transform rice into something else, it goes so nicely on top of clear broth noodles or noodle soups in general. It really is a dish so very close to the hearts of many of the Taiwanese. My closest comparison i could think of to this would be a wonderfully deep and rich beef ragu or bolognese sauce.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/nvxz0x/braised_pork_rice_bowl_recipe_melt_in_your_mouth/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/nvxz0x/braised_pork_rice_bowl_recipe_melt_in_your_mouth/

I don’t have a grill/smoker, but this would definitely work great with one of those cooking methods. Video recipe can be found [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4laa4IpdTIE&amp;t=10s). 

Ingredients:

-7lb bone-in skinless pork shoulder

-5 cloves garlic, crushed

-1 inch piece of ginger, thinly sliced

-2 green onion

-2/3cup hoisin sauce

-1/3cup rice wine

-1/2cup honey

-1/2cup soy sauce

-1tsp white pepper

-2tsp star anise powder

-red food dye, optional

Instructions:

 1. Make the marinade by pouring 2/3cup hoisin sauce, 1/3cup rice wine, 1/2cup honey, 1/2cup soy sauce, 1tsp white pepper, and 2tsp star anise powder in a cup/bowl.  Add red food dye if you want that classic char siu look.  Stir to combine.
 
2. Place the pork shoulder in a sealable bag or pot.  Add in the garlic, ginger, and green onion.  Then pour in the marinade.  Remove any excess air from the bag and seal tight.
 
3. Let the pork marinade for 12-24 hours in the fridge.  The longer the better.

4. When the pork is done marinating, pour the leftover marinade into a saucepan.

5. Cook the pork in a preheated 250F oven for about 12 hours or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 200F.  Cooking time will vary depending on the pork's weight and your oven.  You can also use a grill or smoker instead of the oven.  Cover the pork with foil after about an hour to prevent burning.
 
6. While the pork cooks, bring the marinade to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce the marinade into a sauce until you achieve your desired thickness.  Keep in mind the marinade will thicken after it cools.  Remove the garlic, ginger, and green onion when done and let cool before storing in the fridge.
 
7. After the pork is done, remove the shoulder bone and pull the meat apart using two forks.
 
8. Enjoy the pulled pork with the sauce as is or in BBQ pork buns, sandwiches, salads, or rice bowls.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/nrt4c5/char_siu_pulled_pork/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/nrt4c5/char_siu_pulled_pork/

mtbrwd,Cochinita Pibil Tacos with Pickled Red Onion &amp; Homemade Cornmeal Tortillas,2305,66,1618748351.0,0.99,Pork,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/oy9g3405cxt61.jpg,"Cochinita Tacos are one of the most popular foods in the Mexican region of Yucatan. Pork meat is prepared by marinating in a unique spice blend called Red Recado and slow-cooked in fruit juices over a period of 21 hours. The meat is then mixed with the cooking juices, served on a corn tortilla with red onion pickle. Taco is garnished with cilantro or parsley. Sometimes salsa or guacamole is also served as a topping but it is a personal preference.

At home, I used a slow-cooker on a low setting. 8 pm start for the overnight cook, meat was ready lunchtime on the following day. The only side effect of this method of cooking is sleepless night as the delicious aromas keep you awake...

## What kind of meat is used for Cochinita Pibil Tacos?

Traditionally, hairless Mexican pig is used for Cochinitas. For the top-quality meat, pigs are raised in an organic setting, fed with a variety of fruit, grass, grains and vegetables. Papaya is their most beloved feed on the menu giving the pork a unique flavour. Almost all parts of the animal are used for recipe ranging from ears, cheeks, main body to offal.

To prepare Cochinitas at home I choose Pork shoulder as my preference. Next time I will definitely try ribs or belly.

Remember to choose the best quality meat from sources that respect animal life and consumers health!

**Ingredients (makes 3 servings)**

*Dragon Sauce*

* 1/4 cup chili garlic sauce (I'd use less if your spice tolerance isn't high)
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup brown sugar

*Pork and Noodles*
    
* 1/2 lb. ground pork* 
* 6 oz. ramen noodles 
* 3 green onions, sliced 
* 1/4 cup unsalted peanuts, chopped
* *Extra* - I added thin half slices of a zucchini for more veggies

**Instructions:**

1. Combine the chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a bowl.
2. Add the ground pork to a skillet and cook over medium heat until it is fully browned (add the zucchini a few minutes after you start cooking the pork). Once browned, add the prepared dragon sauce and chopped peanuts. Allow the pork, zucchini and peanuts to simmer in the sauce for another 5 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced by half.
3. While the pork is browning, begin boiling water for your noodles. Once boiling, add your noodles and cook according to the package directions. Drain the noodles in a colander.
4. Once the sauce has reduced and the noodles have drained, add the noodles to the skillet and toss until everything is combined and coated in sauce. Top with sliced green onions and serve!

**Note:** Instead of ramen noodles, I used frozen Udon noodles from the local Asian store. Also, the pork usually has enough fat where you don't need to use any extra oil in your skillet when cooking. If there is an excess amount of fat after browning, I suggest draining the meat and leaving 1 Tbsp fat in the skillet to combine with the dragon sauce.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/lamzox/pork_and_peanut_dragon_noodles/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/lamzox/pork_and_peanut_dragon_noodles/

This makes around 6 portions

**Ingredients:**

* 1kg (2.2Pounds) pork ribs sliced (remember to buy good quality meat from the good source - It tastes soo much better, especially when it comes to pork)
* 2 peppers diced (yellow and red)
* 1 medium carrot halved and sliced
* 1 celery stalk fine dice
* 2 medium onions diced
* 5 garlic cloves sliced
* 1tsp caraway
* 2 bay leaves
* 3 allspice berries

* 3tbsp of canola oil for frying spices and veg
* gravy to thicken (amount will vary depending on the powder you use)
* parsley to garnish
* pickled jalapeno to garnish
* mashed potato to serve

📷

**Instructions:**

**1.** Heat the frying pan to very high and sear the ribs on each side until golden brown. Once ready, transfer to a spare pot leaving the rendered fat behind.

**2.** Next, lower the heat slightly and fry the mirepoix to colour then transfer to spare pot.

**3.** Add **1tbsp** of canola oil and stir-fry peppers until coloured then transfer to spare pot.

**4.** Lower the heat to medium and add **2tbsp** of canola oil and **5tsp** of paprika, mix it together and cook until aroma heats your nose, don't burn it.

**5.** Transfer all the ingredients back to the braising pan and pour in enough stock to cover everything to **3/4**.

**6.** Add caraway, bay leaves, allspice and black pepper. Bring the temperature to just under the boiling point, cover with a lid and cook for **2-3 hours** or until the meat starts to fall off the bone (during that time you may need to add more stock to keep cooking liquid at **3/4 level**).

**7.** When ready mix couple of tablespoons of gravy powder with a little bit of water (enough to make it runny) and gently stir it into the ribs (add enough to thicken the sauce)

**8.** Remove from the heat and allow to rest for **30 minutes** before serving.

jnga05,My dad's Steamed Spare Ribs with Black Beans (豉汁蒸排骨)!,1140,38,1604429548.0,0.99,Pork,madewithlau,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/jnga05,"Steamed spare ribs - a dim sum dish that's really easy to make at home!

Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdCVFlSWCMI&amp;&amp;list=PLvd5bo3J-_kq4FcYVCOK6ZR87dCGDqrSH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s) for a walkthrough.

## Dim Sum: A Touch of Heart

The way most of us pronounce ""dim sum"" in English is very similar to its Cantonese pronunciation, ""dím sām"", which roughly translates to ""a touch of heart"".

It's a reference to the delectable snacks that 10th century teahouses would serve to traveling merchants in Guangzhou, one of the largest international ports along the Silk Road.

Even though dim sum is widely considered to belong to Cantonese cuisine, it evolved from a wide range of influences, largely because Guangzhou was and still is a critical hub for Chinese trade and a melting pot of different cultures. 

## Rinsing ribs in water 

When dim sum restaurants serve spare ribs, their traditionally preferred look is much less light in color (vs the smoky, charred, dark look of a BBQ rib).

This is mostly an aesthetic choice, made to entice customers to order lots and lots of spare ribs from the carts of delicious foods.

The way to achieve this look is to rinse them in water for an extended period of time.

## Why meat is red

A common misconception is that the red juice that leaks out from meat is blood, but it’s not. Most of the time, the blood has already been drained by the time you buy it, and the red juice is actually a result of freezing the meat during transport. 

When you freeze meat, which is about 75% water, the water inside the muscles expands into ice crystals which rupture the muscle cells, and when the ice thaws, it carries some myoglobin with it.

Myoglobin is an iron-rich protein that turns bright red when it’s exposed to oxygen. The purpose of myoglobin is to store extra oxygen in muscles that are used for extended periods of time.

Interestingly enough, this is why not all meats are red or dark. Beef and pork meat are red because cows and pigs stand and roam almost all day. In contrast, fish meat is mostly white, with some red meat around the fins and tail, because fish float in water and aren’t constantly using the bulk of their muscles. 

# The Recipe

* Prep Time: 25 min
* Total Time: 45 min
* Yield: 4 servings

# Ingredients

Main Ingredients

* 1 lb **spare ribs**
   * Some grocery stores have pre-cut ribs, cut across the bone.
   * If they don't sell pre-cut ribs, you can get St. Louis style ribs, and ask the butcher to cut across the bones for you. That will make your life much, much easier.
   * My dad says it's better to select ribs towards the tail-end of the pig, as these tend to be less fatty.
* 1 tbsp **dried fermented black bean**
* 1 tsp **dried mandarin orange peel** (optional)
   * Also known as ""chenpi"", this is a fragrant ingredient in Chinese cooking and medicine, believed to regulate our chi.
   * My dad uses these for a lot of dishes outside of steamed spare ribs - soups, steamed fish, medicines, and etc. He has a huge stockpile that he's been building and aging for over 15 years.
   * According to my dad, the district of Xinhui in China makes the best damn peels the world has ever seen. This is Xinhui's biggest export and a large economic driver for the famous district.
   * If you like eating mandarin oranges, you can just save the peels and leave them outside to dry in the sun for 2-3 days. They should snap in half pretty easily when dry. Store them in a bag in cool, dry place.
* 1 clove **garlic**
* 1 tsp **ginger**
* **red chili pepper** (a few slices, optional)
* 2 pieces **green onion**

Flavors + Misc

* 0.50 tsp **salt**
* 1 tsp **sugar**
* 0.50 tbsp **light soy sauce**
* 1 tsp **sesame oil**
* 1 tbsp **oyster sauce**
* 0.50 tbsp **Shaoxing wine**
* 1 tbsp **cornstarch** (for rinsing ribs)
* 2 tbsp **cornstarch** (for marinade)
* 0.50 tsp **vegetable oil**

# ----

# Step 1 - Wash and rehydrate black beans, orange peel

Place our **fermented black beans** (1 tbsp) in a bowl, and rinse them under running water for 15-20 seconds. Gently massage the beans as you do this. Drain the water, and set the bowl aside to let the beans rehydrate.

Break off a bit of the **dried mandarin peel** (1 tsp) and soak it in warm water for 5-10 minutes.

# Step 2 - Cut spare ribs

Cut the **spare ribs** (1 lb) between the bones into small pieces (about 1 to 1.5 inches), and place them into a bowl.

# Step 3 - Rinse and dry ribs

This step is done in 3 parts.

* Cornstarch:
   * Add **cornstarch** (1 tbsp) to the ribs, and massage the ribs around to evenly mix the cornstarch around the surface of each rib.
   * The cornstarch helps bind to the myoglobin and juices that we're looking to cleanse out.
* Rinse:
   * Rinse the ribs in running water for 1 to 2 minutes, massaging the ribs as you go.
* Dry:
   * Pour out all of the water, and press and squeeze the ribs against a colander to get rid of excess water
   * Take a thick paper towel and wrap the ribs in it, pressing and patting to absorb moisture.

# Step 4 - Marinate ribs

Before we start marinating, if you want to save time for later, start boiling 3-4 cups of water. This will be added to our wok when we start steaming.

Let's prepare our marinade:

* Add **salt** (0.50 tsp), **sugar** (1 tsp), **light soy sauce** (0.50 tbsp), **oyster sauce** (1 tbsp), **Shaoxing wine** (0.50 tbsp) to a separate bowl.
* Mince **garlic** (1 clove), **ginger** (1 tsp), **rehydrated mandarin orange peel** (1 tsp), and add them to the separate bowl.
   * While we're at it, cut a few slices of **red chili pepper** () and our **green onion** (2 pieces). These will be used as garnish for later.
* Combine the bowl of flavors into the bowl of ribs. Mix and massage the bowl of ribs for 45-60 seconds to distribute all of the flavors.
* Mince the **black beans** (1 tbsp), add to the bowl of ribs, and mix / massage the ribs for 20-30 seconds
* Add **sesame oil** (1 tsp) and **cornstarch** (2 tbsp), and mix / massage the ribs around for another 60 seconds to evenly coat each rib with cornstarch.

Massaging the ribs, i.e. applying a little bit of pressure, helps the meat absorb the flavors and tenderizes the meat a bit.

# Step 5 - Prepare to steam ribs

Heat our wok on our stove, placing our steamer rack in the center of the wok. Add enough boiled water so that it just barely covers the entire steamer rack.

Transfer the ribs into the plate you'll be steaming with, being careful not to let any ribs be covered by one another. Add the chili pepper slices, and pour vegetable oil on the ribs.

# Step 6 - Cover wok &amp; steam

Carefully place the plate of ribs on top of the steamer rack. Double check to make sure that there's a little bit of water touching the bottom surface of the plate.

Cover the wok, set the stove to its highest heat setting, and steam the spare ribs for 20 minutes.

# Step 7 - Garnish &amp; enjoy!

After 20 minutes, turn the heat off, uncover the wok, garnish with the green onions, and carefully remove the plate from the wok. Enjoy!

# Celebrating my parents' legacy 

I've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.

This sausage leek risotto with sage is rich, creamy, spicy, and loaded with chopped Swiss chard. It's a perfectly comforting sausage risotto recipe!

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Servings: 6 

Calories: 520kcal 

Author: Kylie Perrotti

### Equipment

* Wide pot

### Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon neutral cooking oil for frying
* 1 pound loose hot Italian sausage
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper optional
* 4 tablespoons butter divided
* 2 small leeks thoroughly washed, trimmed, and cut thinly into rounds
* 1½ cups arborio rice
* 4-5 cups hot chicken broth low-sodium
* 1 bunch Swiss chard stems removed, leaves chopped
* 2 ounces sage leaves chiffonaded
* ⅓ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Brown the Sausage:

* Heat the cooking oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks, for 10-12 minutes until well-browned and cooked-through. Season with extra crushed red pepper, if desired. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
* Drain off excess fat from the pot, reserving any fond stuck to the bottom of the pot.

#### Cook the Leeks:

* Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the pot. Once frothy, add the leeks and cook for 8-10 minutes until very soft. Season lightly with salt and pepper.

#### Start the Rice:

* Melt the remaining butter in the pot and add the rice. Cook over medium heat, stirring regularly, for 2-3 minutes until just beginning to turn translucent.

#### Cook the Risotto:

* Add 1 ladle of the hot broth (it should be enough to mostly cover the rice in the pot) and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat to low and stir often for 2-3 minutes until most of the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding a ladle of liquid and stirring for a few minutes until absorbed until 4 cups of the liquid has been added. If you need more liquid, add another cup and allow the liquid to absorb.

#### Cook the Greens:

* Once most of the liquid has been absorbed, add the chopped Swiss chard, sage, and reserved cooked sausage. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring regularly, until the Swiss chard is wilted. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

#### Finish the Risotto:

* Turn the heat off the risotto and allow it to rest for 5 minutes. Grate the parmesan cheese into the pot and stir to incorporate.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the risotto between bowls and add a little more parmesan on top, if desired. Enjoy!

### INGREDIENTS

* 1.5 pounds thick pork belly (about 1.5 inches wide; skin on)
* 3 cups water
* 2 cloves garlic (crushed)
* 1/2 inch ginger (sliced thin)
* 2 star anise
* 10 Szechuan peppercorn (optional if can’t find at grocery store)
* 1/2 cinnamon stick
* 2 tablespoons cooking oil
* 7 tablespoons brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 4 tablespoons dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)

### DIRECTIONS

* In a wide pot or pan, add the three cups of water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat (the water level should be at least half the thickness of the pork belly). Add the pork belly and parboil for a minute on each side, just until the exterior is a bit firm. Remove the pork belly to a cutting board, and set the hot water aside (don’t pour it out!)
* Add the garlic, ginger, star anise, Szechuan peppercorn, and cinnamon stick to the water and keep over low heat (we need this water to be hot since we will be adding it back to the pork and if it gets cold then it might cause the meat to toughen up)
* Cut the pork belly into cubes about 1.5 inches on each side
* In a Dutch oven or large pot, start heating up the oil over medium-low heat. Add 3.5 tablespoons of the brown sugar. Let the sugar sit undisturbed until you see it start to melt. Once it starts melting, you can use a single chopstick to mix it up a bit to speed up the melting process
* When all the sugar has melted and turned into a dark amber color, add the pork belly. Cook while flipping the pieces for a few minutes until almost every side of each piece is covered with the caramel. Be gentle so you don’t break the pieces!
* Add the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine and cook for a minute. Then add the water with all the spices and aromatics. Braise the pork belly over medium-low heat for 2 hours, stirring once every 30 minutes
* After 2 hours, the pork should be fully tender. You can check by sticking a chopstick into the meat through the bottom. The chopstick should be able to easily pierce the entire piece. If you want it to be more tender, put the lid back on and keep braising until it reaches your desired tenderness
* Remove the lid and raise the heat to medium. Add the remaining 3.5 tablespoons of sugar and mix. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the sauce has reduced significantly and thickened up. Stir every few minutes to prevent the meat from burning. You’ll know it’s done when the sauce is thick enough to start sticking to the meat
* Remove the meat from the pot and then drizzle with some of the extra sauce. Serve hot with a side of rice and vegetables

**Directions:**

1. Cut the pork belly into 2mm slices, cut the chili peppers into strips, and chop the garlic and ginger.

4. Stir fry the garlic and chili peppers for 2 minutes. Add the cooked meat. Turn down the heat to medium.

inqkzg,Argentinian Bondiola!. really easy and tasty cured pork recipe,1228,40,1599414979.0,0.98,Pork,TotalmenteMati,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/inqkzg,"**Ingredients**

time. you are gonna need at least 3 weeks or even more.

about 2kg of pork shoulder. or any meat from the neck area. the cuts you get in the us will probably be different than the argentinian one I used. but as long as it has no skin and no bones it will work

a container big enough to fit your meat without touching the sides. it needs to be able to close

enough coarse salt to completely cover the bondiola, it depends on your container

non stick cooking paper (parchment paper, baking paper. I don't know how it's called there)

some string to tie up

50g sweet paprika

50g red pepper flakes

a scale is recommended

**Steps**

1-First you get your meat. if it's kinda roundish you can leave it there. if it has any really weird shapes or is too big you can cut it in half as I did with mine  just make sure the parts are kinda round

2-pour about 2cm of coarse salt in the container. then lay your meat there and completely cover it with coarse salt

3-Leave it in fridge without opening the container for a week. that should mostly dry it and give it some salt taste

4-once a week has passed  you want to get it out of the container. then discard the salt.

5-Completely rinse all salt out of it. none of it can stay. check all little holes and make sure no salt is left

6-dry it with some paper towels make sure it's not wet

7-mix your red pepper flakes and sweet paprika. but not all of it, this is where you select how spicy you want it. I did 60% sweet paprika, 40% red pepper flakes.  you can put a bit less pepper flakes but I wouldn't put more of it in there

8-now with that mix, completely rub the meat with it. make sure it's all covered. you don't need to use all the mix you made. but just make sure you cover all of it

9-once it's covered try to give it a more round shape with your hands. it doesn't need to be perfect

10- now tightly surround it with your cooking paper make sure it isn't loose. once you do that, tie the ends in opossite directions. like one of those candy papers

11-now tie the ends, with your string. then use the string to tie sections of the meat to make it as round as you can

12-Weigh it in your scale and write down the weight.

13-put in fridge. and wait. weigh it periodically once the bondiola weighs 30% less than that weight you measured earlier it's ready to eat, for example if it weighs 2kg. you have to wait till it weighs 1.4kg.

And you Are Done! try to slice it as thin as you can and eat it with some nice bread. this is extremely tasty and really easy and cheap to make. it tastes brilliant and you will be absolutely in love with it.

ikoo94,Thai Pork Stuffed Cucumber Soup,1259,37,1598981247.0,0.97,Pork,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/16742jdnmkk51.jpg,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Thai Pork Cucumber Soup**](https://triedtrue.us/PorkCucumberSoup)

Someone told me about Chrissy Teigan’s Thai pork stuffed cucumber soup and I knew I wanted to try making my own version of it. 

The woman who posted it to our group shared Chrissy Teigan's recipe and she said she felt like the version she ate growing up had more cilantro or spices in it. I did a little hunting and found a version on Cookpad by Kanya from Thailand which uses LOTS of cilantro. Kanya's version uses tofu, which I didn’t have, so I omitted that.

Obviously, both versions are probably equally tasty, but I was definitely intrigued by the white pepper in the pork from Kanya's recipe, so that's what I used as my starting point.

This is a really easy recipe and a unique take on a really cheap veggie that most of us are probably swimming in this time of year!

# SUBSTITUTIONS:

Ground Pork: Ground chicken or ground turkey

Cucumber: Seedless or seeded, doesn't matter

Ground White Pepper: Use black pepper instead – it won't have exactly the same flavor, but it's ok.

You can follow Kanya's method and add tofu to it, as well!

# RECIPE

## Equipment

* Large pot

## Ingredients

## Pork Mixture

* 1 pound ground pork
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* ½ tablespoon sesame oil
* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
* ¼ cup fresh cilantro leaves and stems minced (see note)

## Cucumber Soup:

* 2 large cucumbers
* 6 cups water or low-sodium chicken stock
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* ½ tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 bunch cilantro stems minced (see note)
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 scallion minced; white and green parts separated
* Salt, to taste
* Sesame seeds optional, for garnish

## Instructions

## Prepare the Broth:

* Combine the water, soy sauce, sesame oil, minced cilantro stems, black pepper, sriracha, and white part of the scallion in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

## Prepare the Cucumbers:

* Peel the cucumbers and cut into three or four pieces depending on the length. Using the back of a spoon, hallow out the seeds and discard them. Set aside.

## Prepare the Pork Mixture:

* In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the pork and mix until well-combined.

## Stuff the Cucumbers:

* Carefully stuff the cucumbers with the pork. Roll any remaining pork into small meatballs.

## Boil the Cucumbers:

* Turn the heat on the broth to a vigorous simmer. Carefully drop the cucumbers and meatballs into the soup and cook for about 15-20 minutes until the pork is completely cooked through and the cucumbers have softened. Turn off the heat.

## To Serve:

* Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with extra cilantro leaves, minced green part of the scallion, and sesame seeds. Enjoy!

## Notes

*In this recipe, you can use 1* [*small*](https://www.wikihow.com/video/f/fd/Chop%20Cilantro%20Step%207%20Version%202.360p.mp4) *bunch of cilantro. Cut the cilantro right beneath where the bunch becomes leafy and mince the stems. Use about 1/4 cup of the leaves for the meatballs and use any remaining cilantro as garnish.

# Ingredients
- Pork chops, 2, half-inch in thickness
- Bread, 4 slices
- Mayonnaise
- [My Homemade Tonkatsu Sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0AEvmtHmC8&amp;list=PLkJgT1cRUcdGH1fUg07PTGC5n5C3xylSM&amp;index=3), 4 servings

[Full written recipe with ingredients &amp; instructions here.](https://straightupeats.com/pork-cutlet-sandwich-recipe/)

# Instructions
1. *Optional* Combine the pork with the BRINE ingredients and allow to brine overnight. On the day of cooking, rinse the pork, and dry it thoroughly.
2. Cut the bread into cubes and place into a food processor. Pulse until you get crumbs a little larger than standard panko crumb size. 
3. Coat the pork katsu in flour on both sides, and shake off the excess. Add the katsu into the egg and coat both sides. Dredge the pork again by repeating this step.
4. Add the pork into the panko bread crumbs and cover it completely. Lightly press the crumbs onto the pork, then place the katsu aside. Repeat with the remaining katsu.
5. In a large pot, heat cooking oil to 340F. When you add the katsu, the temperature will drop. Adjust the heat to bring the oil to a stable 325F. As the oil is heating up, allow the katsu to cook for 2 - 3 minutes, then flip. Cook for another 2 - 3 minutes, then remove to a draining rack and allow to cool.
6. On two slices of bread, spread mayonnaise, and my homemade tonkatsu sauce.
7. Pour homemade tonkatsu sauce on top of the pork katsu on both sides.
8. Place the katsu on the bread, top with sliced cucumber, and assemble the sandwich.
9. Slice into thirds, then repeat with the second sandwich. Serve with extra homemade tonkatsu sauce on the side.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/i18hzc/japanese_fried_pork_cutlet_sandwiches/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/i18hzc/japanese_fried_pork_cutlet_sandwiches/

1 lb skinless pork belly, cut into 2 long strips (450 g)

2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic

**Char Siu Sauce:**

2 pieces Chinese fermented red bean curd

1 tablespoon maltose or honey

1 tablespoon Chinese Shaoxing wine

1 tablespoon soy sauce

1 tablespoon oyster sauce

1 teaspoon dark and thick soy sauce

1 teaspoon five-spice powder

1/4 teaspoon white pepper powder

3 1/2 oz sugar (100 g or 8 1/2 tablespoons)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Get a big bowl, mix all the Char Siu Sauce ingredients, add the garlic and pork belly and marinate overnight in the fridge.

The next day, heat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Place the pork belly on a wire rack or in a pan lined with aluminum foil. Roast for 15 minutes.

Removed from oven and turn the pork belly over, brush the remaining Char Siu Sauce on the pork. Continue to roast for another 15 minutes.

Set the oven to Broil and broil each side of the pork belly for about 1 min, until each side become nicely charred. The char siu will look dark in color, it's normal.

You may heat up the remaining Char Siu Sauce and bring to a simmer. Set aside.
Slice the char siu into thin and bite-size pieces, serve immediately with steamed white rice and the remaining Char Siu Sauce.

* 1 rack of ribs
* Half a pineapple
* 1 cup of beer
* 1 teaspoon of habanero hot sauce (or any hot sauce of your choice)
* 5 tablespoons of honey
* 1 teaspoon of salt

## DIRECTION

1. Remove the skin from the pineapple, and cut it into big pieces.
2. Put the pineapple pieces into a blender, and blend until smooth.
3. Add the beer, the hot sauce and the salt and blend until homogeneous.
4. Remove the membrane that is on the ribs (your butcher might have done that already).
5. Pour the marinade into a big dish that will be used to marinate the ribs. Submerge the ribs into the marinade and let them rest for 1 hour at room temperature.
6. Toward the end of the marination time, preheat your oven at 150°C (or 300°F).
7. Remove the ribs from the marinade and let them drain a bit. Wrap them tightly in a few layers of aluminium foil and place them in the oven. Cook for one and a half hours.
8. While the ribs cook, filter the marinade to keep only the liquid. Transfer the liquid into a sauce pan and bring it to a boil on medium-high heat.
9. Boil the sauce for 2 minutes, then reduce the heat to gently simmer and add the honey.
10. Periodically stir the sauce while it continues to reduce until becomes light brown colour and has a slightly syrupy texture. At that point remove it from heat and reserve from later.
11. After one and a half hour in the oven, the ribs should be cooked through but without the finishing touches. Take them out of the oven and switch on the grill or broiler of your oven.
12. Remove the ribs from the foil and coat them generously with the reduced sauce.
13. Put them under the grill or broiler for another 5 to 10 minutes or until you begin to have crispy spots.

If you don’t have a pressure cooker you fry it for an hour, with a pressure cooker it’s less than an 10 minutes plus pressurization time.

You want to score the pork belly meat side up almost down to the skin. You want a grid of meat still attached to the skin

squeeze lime (or lemon/orange if lime not available) juice all over the skin and rub it in good. Then you want to dust it lightly with baking soda and let it marinate for 30 minutes. 

You should rinse them with water before throwing them in your hot oil (sauté enough oil to cover until its hot/I’ve also heard they render enough fat that you don’t need any oil at all) for extra crispy skin. Dry them off a little don’t start a fire.

emse22,Porchetta Sandwich with Salsa Verde on Sesame Rolls,1655,21,1578669824.0,0.98,Pork,saucesandwich_,https://i.redd.it/bvdac6scxy941.jpg,"Here's the recipe for my oven roasted porchetta sandwich with salsa verde, grated caciocavallo, on a sourdough sesame roll. Local cheese from Jersey Cheese and pork sourced from NK Prime Meats.

You’ll find countless porchetta recipes that all use different cuts of pork (from pork shoulder to pork belly) but the traditional method uses a large section of pork belly with the ribs removed and the loin still attached. If you can’t find a butcher who can prepare this more specialized cut for you, a compromise would be taking a skin-on cut of pork belly and a piece of pork loin, and working backwards to recreate the original cut. [**I made this short video where you can watch the exact process of how the meat was broken down and rolled together with a blend of aromatics.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmYsbIotBVM&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**The filling:**

Finely dice fennel fronds, rosemary, sage, and garlic and mix together in a medium size mixing bowl. Add dried &amp; crushed hot chili flakes to taste. Add zest of one lemon. Add 2 teaspoons of dried fennel seed powder, salt and pepper. Add oil oil so the entire mixture comes together like a thick paste. 

Remove the skin from the belly and set aside for later. Next cut the  loin to the exact size of the belly and butterfly it open to maximize  the surface area of the meat. Set the loin piece aside and spread the  aromatic filling all over the surface of the pork belly, fat side down.  Lay in the butterflied loin piece and generously spread more of the  filling all over the meat. Carefully roll up the belly and loin and  position with fat side facing up. Rub more paste all over the top before  laying on the piece of skin that was previously removed.

Using butcher's twine, you want to carefully truss the porchetta every few inches so that the whole piece is secure during cooking. Using a sharp boning knife, make small punctures all over the surface of the skin so that the fat renders out during cooking. Wrap porchetta and refrigerate for 6 hours to overnight. Allow to sit out at room temperature before putting it into the oven to allow the meat to relax, yielding a more tender piece of meat.

**Roasting:**

Set porchetta into a roasting pan with rack to keep the meat elevated during cooking. Cook for 40 minutes at 475F before lowering the temperature down to 300F for another 2 - 4 hours until the internal temperature reads 155F. The skin should puff up as it cooks and result in an airy, crispy texture. If skin still feels rubbery, use the broiler (with a very careful eye not to burn it) to finish off the skin before removing from the oven. Allow the meat to rest 30 minutes before slicing. 

**Salsa Verde:**

Using a food processor, blend together two bunches of parsley, garlic, a few spoonfuls of capers, 3 fillets of anchovies, juice of one lemon, a few splashes of white vinegar, and a few glugs of olive oil.

**Porchetta Sandwich:**

Slice porchetta in thin slices and set aside some of the crispy skin. Layer meat on a freshly baked sourdough sesame roll ([recipe here](https://www.saucesandwich.com/blog/sourdough-sesame-rolls)) and top with salsa verde and freshly grated caciocavallo cheese (or provolone).

The key is pickle juice.
Instructions for slow cooker and pressure cooker 

Ingredients

⅓ cup brown sugar

2 tablespoons garlic powder

2 tablespoons onion powder

2 tablespoons chili powder

1 tablespoon paprika

1 tablespoon kosher salt

½ tablespoon fresh black pepper

2-3 lb pork loin, pork shoulder or pork butt

⅓ cup neutral oil like canola oil,omit if not searing

1/2 cup pickle juice or apple cider vinegar

1 ½ cups apple juice I use Martinelli’s apple juice. Use a good quality brand

1 cup BBQ sauce


Instructions

Pressure Cooker Instructions

In a small mixing bowl, measure out and mix the brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, paprika, kosher salt and black pepper.

Set pressure cooker to saute/brown and allow to heat up.

Cut away any large fat caps on your piece or pork and discard. Cut pork into two or three separate pieces (depending on the size of your pork, cut 2 pounds in half and cut 3 pounds into 3 pieces).

Coat each piece of pork in the dry rub. Ensure that each piece is completely covered. You will have leftover dry rub. It will be added later.

Once the pressure cooker has heated up, add the neutral oil. Add in the pieces of pork (now covered in the dry rub) and allow to sear for 2-3 minutes on each side. You should hear a solid sizzle when the meat hits the pan. If you don’t, remove the pork and allow the cooking vessel to come to temperature. The pork should develop a brown sear after 2-3 minutes. Continue until all four sides are seared on all pieces of the meat.

After the meat has been seared, add in the remaining dry rub mixture, pickle juice, apple juice and BBQ sauce.

Close and lock the pressure cooker according to your manufacturer’s guidelines. Ensure that the steam vent is closed. Set the pressure to high for 1 hour.

After the pork is cooked, do a quick release of the pressure using the steam valve.

Remove as much of the pork as you can into a heatproof large mixing bowl (it is easier to see what you’re shredding). Shred with 2 forks until desired consistency. Add the pork back to the cooking vessel and switch to the saute/brown function to reduce the sauce.

Reduce the sauce for 8-10 minutes and continue to stir with a wooden spoon until the sauce thickens.

Eat and enjoy in your favorite recipe.

Slow Cooker Instructions

On the stove, preheat a cast iron pan over medium high heat.

In a small mixing bowl, measure out and mix the brown sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, paprika, kosher salt and black pepper.

Cut away any large fat caps on your piece or pork and discard. Cut pork into two or three separate pieces (depending on the size of your pork. Cut 2 pounds in half and cut 3 pounds into 3 pieces).

Coat each piece of pork in the dry rub. Ensure that each piece of completely covered. You will have leftover dry rub. It will be added later.

Once the cast iron has heated up, add the neutral oil and add in the pieces of pork (now covered in the dry rub) and allow to sear for 2-3 minutes on each side. You should hear a solid sizzle when the meat hits the pan. If you don’t, remove the pork and allow the pan to come to temperature. The pork should develop a brown sear after 2-3 minutes. Continue until all four sides are seared on all pieces of the meat.

Remove the pork and add to the slow cooker. Turn off the heat and remove the cast iron pan to a cold burner. Deglaze the pan with the apple juice and scrape up any of the fond (the brown bits from the seared pork). Pour into the slow cooker.

Add in the the rest of the dry rub, pickle juice and the BBQ sauce.

Cover and heat on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 4-6 hours (time will depend on how big your pieces of meat are) until meat is tender enough to easily shred.

Remove as much of the pork as you can into a heatproof large mixing bowl (it is easier to see what you’re shredding). Shred with 2 forks until desired consistency.

Add the remaining sauce to a medium saucepan on the stove. Reduce the sauce for 6-8 minutes over medium heat and continue to stir with a wooden spoon until the sauce thickens.

Pour sauce over the shredded pork and stir well to combine.

Eat and enjoy in your favorite recipe.

Notes

Bbq pulled pork freezes really well. Make and use whatever you need for a recipe and freeze the rest.

You can definitely do this with a smaller cut of pork (less than 2 pounds) but ensure that you still have plenty of liquid in the pressure cooker (at least 1 cup). I usually keep the measurements the same and just have extra sauce mixed with the pulled pork.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ebffp4/pressure_cooker_bbq_pulled_pork/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ebffp4/pressure_cooker_bbq_pulled_pork/

2 cups water

Add beans and water to pan. Bring to a simmer and use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape off any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Return the pork chops to the pan, placing them carefully atop the vegetables. Cover pan and simmer 10 minutes, or until chops are cooked through.

Move chops to a clean platter. Sprinkle the flour over the beans and sauce and stir it in. Cook for several minutes, stirring frequently, until sauce is thickened to your liking.

btrtmh,2 Ways to Cook Tender &amp; Juicy Thick Pork Chops,11,9,1558993571.0,0.84,Pork,bearcusine,https://i.redd.it/v7zg251gqt031.jpg,"[Click here for the video version](https://youtu.be/dA6h7eCDqps)

&amp;#x200B;

Compared to thin pork chops, I have found out that thick pork chops are much better tasting and are easier to cook. It doesn’t require very complicated steps, and it comes out as good as a juicy steak, but at a fraction of the price!

&amp;#x200B;

**Seasoning** (for 6 thick pork chops)

\- 2 tbsp of Cajun seasoning

\- 2 tsp of garlic powder

\- 2 tsp of onion powder

\- 1 tsp of cayenne pepper

\- 1 tsp of sugar

\- 1 tsp of black pepper

\- ½ tsp of salt

You can also use your favorite seasoning here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Method 1 – Oven Baked Pork Chop**

1. Preheat the oven at 400°F
2. Season all of the sides of pork chop, and let it rest for 30 minutes
3. Heat a cast iron pan and sear both sides of the pork chop for 5 minutes, then oven bake for about 15 minutes (1.5 inches thick pork chop), until the internal temperature reaches 145°F

&amp;#x200B;

**Method 2 – Grilled pork chop**

1. Heat the grill at 400°F.
2. Season all of the sides of pork chop, and let it rest for 30 minutes
3. After seasoning, use foil to wrap the pork chop. Toss the pork chop directly in the grill. Grill both side with foil for 5 minutes.
4. Take the pork out of the foil, grill both sides for 5 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Adjust the cooking time according to how big your pork chop is. Once the internal temperature reaches 145°F, it is done!

As pork chop has a lot of lean parts, one of the biggest challenge to cook a pork chop is to not overcook and dry it out. Use a meat thermometer to determine if the pork is cooked. The National Pork Board recommends cooking chops to an internal temperature of 145°F",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/btrtmh/2_ways_to_cook_tender_juicy_thick_pork_chops/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/btrtmh/2_ways_to_cook_tender_juicy_thick_pork_chops/

**Ingredients**

   * 1 1/2 cup uncooked wild rice
   * 1 teaspoon salt
   * 6 slices thick cut bacon chopped
   * 8 ounces button mushrooms sliced
   * 10 ounces fresh or frozen spinach thawed if frozen
   * 1 cup roasted pistachios
   * 8 ounces feta cheese crumbled
   * 1 pound pork loin roast 2 1/2
   * 1/2 cup grainy mustard
   * 1/2 cup brown sugar
   * pinch of cayenne pepper
   * 1 cups medium pineapple peeled, cored + diced, about 5
   * 1 medium delicata squash halved, deseeded + sliced into half moons

***

**Instructions**

1. Cook the wild rice according to package directions. I brought 4 cups water to a boil, added the rice and simmered, covered for 45 minutes until the rice was fluffy and the water absorbed.
    
2. Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook until the fat begins to render, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and continue cooking until the bacon crisps, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the spinach. Allow the spinach to wilt into the bacon mushroom mixture.
    
3. Once the rice is cooked, stir in the bacon mixture + all the drippings from the pan. Stir in the pistachios and then crumble in the feta. Season the rice with salt + pepper.
    
4. Place pork, fat side down, on work surface with 1 short end facing you. Using long thin sharp knife and starting 1/2 inch above underside of roast, cut 1/2 inch in along right side. Continue cutting 1/2 inch above underside, unrolling roast like carpet.
    
5. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven.
    
6. Once your pork roast is in a flat piece, use a meat mallet to pound the pork so that most of the meat is in one even layer.
    
7. Spread about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the wild rice over the pork.
    
8. Roll up pork; arrange seam side down on work surface (fat side will be facing up). Using kitchen string, tie at 1- to 1 1/2-inch intervals. Transfer pork, fat side up, to roasting pan. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon coarse salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
    
9. Rub the pork all over with the mustard and then sprinkle on the brown sugar + cayenne. Add the pineapple.
    
10. Roast pork for 25 minutes at 425 degrees F. Add the squash rounds and reduce the oven temperature to 375. Continue to roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of loin registers 140-160 degrees F. (it will be cooked medium but still slightly pink), about 35-50 minutes. Let the roast rest for at least 20 minutes before slicing. Serve the pork along side the remaining rice + roasted squash and pomegranate arils (if desired).

Boneless will work for this recipe as well, but it will cook through a bit quicker. 

***
**Ingredients**

   * 1 6–7-pound bone-in pork shoulder (Boston butt), preferably skinless
   * 3 tablespoons kosher salt, plus more
   * 2 medium butternut squash (about 7 pounds total; pick ones that are about the same size and shape)
   * 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more
   * 2 cups apple cider or juice
   * ½ cup low-sodium soy sauce or tamari
   * ½ cup distilled white vinegar, plus more
   * 1 head of garlic
   * 6 scallions, trimmed
   * Steamed white rice (for serving)

***
**Preparation**

1. Place pork shoulder on a rimmed baking sheet and rub all over with 3 Tbsp. salt. Let pork rest, uncovered, at least 1 hour and up to 2 to come up to room temperature. (This will help it to cook more evenly.)

2. Arrange racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 300°. Slice squash in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out seeds and stringy parts. Season all over with salt, then rub with a bit of oil. Transfer cut side down to another rimmed baking sheet.

3. Once pork is room temperature, pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high until shimmering and almost smoking. Cook pork on all sides until well browned, about 15 minutes total—be patient! Carefully transfer pork back to rimmed baking sheet, turn off heat, and even more carefully pour out whatever fat has accumulated in bottom of pot.

4. Return pot to medium-high heat and add apple cider, soy sauce, and ½ cup vinegar, scraping bottom to get up any crispy, stuck-on bits. Slice head of garlic in half crosswise and add to pot. Lower pork back into pot. Cover pork with a piece of aluminum foil and tuck it around pork. Cover pot and transfer to lower rack of oven. Place baking sheet with squash on top rack. Bake pork, turning after 1½ hours, until meat is very tender and pulling away from the bone, 3–3½ hours total. Bake squash until a fork poked through skin slides easily into flesh, 1–1½ hours.

5. Transfer pork to a large plate or platter, reserving pot with cooking liquid, and let rest until cool enough to handle—it’s a big piece of meat, so this will probably take close to an hour. Remove garlic with a slotted spoon and squeeze out cloves into braising liquid; discard skins. Tear pork into shaggy pieces, discarding any sections of fat or gristle, and return meat to pot with cooking liquid. Season pork and liquid with salt and a splash of vinegar. Slice scallions crosswise as thinly as possible.

6. To serve, reheat pork in liquid over low heat. Using a large spoon, scoop out pieces of squash and arrange on plates. Spoon pork and some juices over squash and garnish with sliced scallions. Serve with rice alongside.

2. **Honey Balsamic Sauce.** Add 1 tbsp butter to the now empty pan and add chopped scallions, garlic, fresh chopped rosemary and thyme. Cook for 2 minutes on medium heat.
    
3. Next, add 2nd tablespoon butter, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup honey and cook until well incorporated, approximately 2 minutes. Now add 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard - this will thicken the sauce. Taste the sauce and add salt, if necessary.
    
4. Assembly. Add pork chops back to the pan and reheat spooning the sauce all over.

7ok14r,Crown Roast of Pork with Lady Apples and Shallots,179,7,1515254752.0,0.95,Pork,bob-the-cook,https://i.redd.it/mazmihbq0h801.jpg,"Once you’ve got the two racks tied together (and the lady apples halved), making this crown pork recipe is as simple as any other roast.

***
**Ingredients**

   * 2 8-bone racks of pork (about 4 pounds each), chine bone removed, fat trimmed to ¼-inch thick, rib bones frenched
   * 1½ cups (packed) light brown sugar
   * 10 ounces kosher salt (2 cups Diamond Crystal or 1¼ cups Morton)
   * 1 cup apple cider vinegar
   * 12 garlic cloves, finely grated
   * 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme, plus 8 sprigs
   * 1 tablespoon brown mustard seeds
   * 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
   * ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons whole grain Dijon mustard
   * 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
   * 4 ounces bacon, chopped
   * 12 lady apples, halved
   * 1½ pounds shallots, peeled, halved lengthwise if large
   * 3 cups dry hard cider

***
**Directions**

1. Lay racks of pork flat on work surface, meaty side down (the inside of the ribs should be facing up). Use a knife to make 3 vertical 3""-long slits (about 1"" deep) into the loins of each rack, 1 slit between every 2 ribs. Place each rack of pork into a 1-gal. resealable plastic bag and chill.

2. Heat brown sugar, salt, and 4 cups water in a large saucepan over medium, stirring until sugar and salt are dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add vinegar and 4 cups ice water. Chill brine until cold, about 1 hour.

3. Divide brine between bags with pork and seal, squeezing out excess air; chill pork 8–24 hours.

4. Remove pork from bags and pat dry. Place on a large rimmed baking sheet; let sit 2 hours to bring to room temperature.

5. Preheat oven to 300°. Mix garlic, chopped thyme, mustard seeds, pepper, ¼ cup mustard, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl. Smear all over pork, working into slits; tuck thyme sprigs into slits. Upend both racks so they’re parallel to one another with bones facing up and slits facing out. Curve racks toward each other so they meet at both ends to form a crown (call a friend to help with this part). Holding pork in place, encircle racks with string and tie securely in 2 places: around rib bones and around thickest part of loin. If desired, wrap tops of bones individually with foil to keep them from burning.

6. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook bacon, stirring often, until fat is rendered and edges are crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer bacon to a roasting pan with a slotted spoon.

7. Working in 2–3 batches, add apples, cut side down, and shallots to same skillet and cook over medium-high heat (undisturbed) until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer apples to roasting pan; turn shallots and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 3 minutes. Transfer to roasting pan.

8. Remove skillet from heat and carefully add cider, stirring and scraping up any browned bits. Pour liquid into roasting pan and place pork in the center, pushing apples and shallots to the edges; reserve skillet. Roast pork until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of loin registers 135°, 1¾–2¼ hours.

9. Remove roast from oven and transfer apples and shallots to a platter; tent with foil. Increase oven temperature to 500°. Transfer pork to a cutting board and pour pan juices into reserved skillet. Return pork to roasting pan; roast until browned and crisp all over, 5–10 minutes. Transfer roast back to cutting board and let rest 30–45 minutes before cutting into chops.

10. Just before serving, whisk remaining 2 Tbsp. mustard into pan juices in skillet and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, whisking often, until sauce is reduced to about 1 cup, 7–10 minutes.

11. Transfer pork chops to platter with apples and shallots; spoon sauce over.

7cssrf,Bone-In Pork Chops with Harissa-Maple Roasted Carrots and Whipped Ricotta,20,5,1510629903.0,0.87,Pork,BushyEyes,https://i.imgur.com/chPJ5UA.jpg,"#GRADE

Serves: 2, with leftover carrots

Cost: $

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: 40 minutes (10 minutes inactive)

#INGREDIENTS

**Roasted Carrots**

12 whole carrots, greens trimmed

3 tablespoons olive oil

2 tablespoons maple syrup

1 tablespoon prepared harissa paste (If you can't find harissa paste, you can omit or add a bit of crushed red pepper or cayenne powder to add a touch of heat)

Salt and pepper to taste

Fresh minced parsley, optional, for garnish

**Whipped Ricotta**

4 ounces ricotta cheese, liquid drained

2 teaspoons heavy cream (more or less depending on your ricotta)

1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

1 teaspoon lemon zest

1 teaspoon lemon juice

Salt, to taste

**Maple-Lemon Dressing**

2 teaspoons maple syrup

2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil

1 teaspoon lemon zest

1 teaspoon lemon juice

**Pork Chops**

2 big, thick bone-in pork chops

1 tablespoon butter, divided

2 tablespoons vegetable oil

Salt and pepper to taste

#METHOD

Prepare Ingredients: Preheat oven to 400ºF. Pat the pork chops dry and season liberally with salt and pepper. Trim the greens from the carrots and scrub the dirt off with a paper towel.

Roast the Carrots: In a bowl, combine the olive oil, maple syrup, and harissa and whisk until smooth. Add the carrots to a roasting pan and toss them in the whisked harissa-maple oil and transfer to the oven. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until the carrots are fork tender, turning once halfway through cooking.

Prepare the Whipped Ricotta: In a food processor, combine the ricotta cheese, heavy cream, extra virgin olive oil, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Pulse until smooth and creamy. If the ricotta seems too thick, add a touch more heavy cream or extra virgin olive oil until your desired consistency is reached. The whipped ricotta should be spreadable. Set aside at room temperature until the carrots have finished roasting.

Prepare the Maple-Lemon Dressing: In a small bowl, whisk the maple syrup, extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and lemon zest until smooth. Set aside.

Cook the Pork Chops: During the last 15 minutes of the carrots roasting, prepare the pork chops. Add the vegetable oil to a large, oven-proof skillet and turn the heat to high. Once the oil is very hot and almost smoking, add the pork chops and cook, without moving, for 4 minutes. Flip and add 1/2 tablespoon of butter to the top of each chop. Transfer to the oven and cook for 6-8 minutes or until the thickest part of the chop closest to the bone reads 140ºF. Remove from the oven and rest for 5-10 minutes. Note: You may wish to cook your chop to the FDA's previously recommended temperature, 165ºF. However, new guidelines recommend 145ºF. I recommend cooking to 140ºF and then resting the chop up to 145º. At this temperature, the pork is juicy and not dry.

To Serve: Add a smear of whipped ricotta to the plates. Arrange a few carrots on top of the whipped ricotta and place a pork chop on top of the carrots at an angle. Serve with a drizzle of the lemon-maple dressing and the minced fresh parsley, if desired.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/7cssrf/bonein_pork_chops_with_harissamaple_roasted/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/7cssrf/bonein_pork_chops_with_harissamaple_roasted/
77xvr0,Melt-in-your-mouth Japanese rolled chashu (marinated pork belly) for ramen,1267,18,1508641531.0,0.95,Pork,iceorrice,https://i.redd.it/x9sw4qd7satz.jpg,"For detailed instructions, you can check out this video: https://youtu.be/Z_3Dyg5B-FY

To print recipe: http://www.iceorrice.com/rolled-chashu-for-ramen-instant-pot/

Chashu is a critical topping for many types of ramen and is often times the hardest thing to get right. When it’s done well, the sweet savory skin will melt in your mouth, adding a punch of flavor to the noodles. The fat will give the broth even more richness and the succulent meat will fall apart with the slightest bite. The chashu will accent and enhance a good bowl of ramen and make it great.

Traditional ramen shops often top their ramen with 2-3 pieces of chashu. Unlike Chinese chashu or “char siu” (barbecued pork), the Japanese chashu uses pork belly that is rolled into a long cylinder and slow cooked in a pork/chicken broth, then transferred to a soy-based broth that consists of soy sauce, sake, and mirin and cooked for hours, as you can see the pictures below. If you want to make the chashu like this, you have to ask your butcher for a special cut. But I was able to just buy the pre-cut ones (much smaller) from the Asian grocery stores and make it at home.

**Why Rolled Pork Belly vs. Slab?**

Most home recipes and even some ramen restaurants use the slabs for the sake of saving time and labor. Serious Eats has a really good article explaining the differences between these two shapes. Simply put, the rolled pork belly is moister and juicier than the slab ones.

""Time and temperature are the most important...but surface area-to-volume ratio also plays a role. The more exposed surface a piece of meat has, the faster it cooks, and the more easily it loses moisture. And of course, the more moisture it loses, the dryer it becomes.""

The end goal of simmering pork belly using lower heat is to get a melt-in-your-mouth texture. The higher cooking temperature it cooks, the drier meat it becomes. This is what you have to consider when making chashu in an electric pressure cooker. The peak working temperature of Instant Pot is 239°F-244°F (115°C-118°C). cooking the slab pork belly in the pressure cooker could squeeze out much more moisture than regular slow-cooking method even though the Instant Pot doesn't always maintain the peak temperature.

After the rolled pork belly is cooked, the lean part outside that has direct contact with the broth is noticeably drier than the part inside. But that's ok because most of the meat inside is insulated with the skin outside so that it is evenly and gently heated. So tying the pork belly firmly is the key to tenderness and keeping a nice shape for final presentation.

**Blanching the pork**

This is a very common technique in Asian cooking to get rid of excess fat, gaminess, and impurities to get a cleaner taste of the soy-based sauce. If you plan to use the sauce for making other dishes or chashu anther time, it's worth doing this step.

**Ingredients**

• 500 g pork belly, skin on

• 1/2 cup soy sauce

• 4 slices ginger

• 1 cup water

• 1/2 cup sake (Japanese rice wine)

• 4 garlic, crushed

• 1 leek

• 1/2 cup mirin

**Instructions**

1. Roll up the pork belly with the skin side out. Run some butcher twine under the middle of the pork. If your pork belly is long and wide, start under the far end instead of the middle. Tie a double knot to secure the pork tightly. Leave the short end about 2 inches long. Pull the long end to wrap around the pork belly and tie another double knot.

2. In a pot of boiling water, blanch the pork belly for about 10 minutes. Transfer the pork to a pressure cooker. Add soy sauce, leek, ginger, water, sake, garlic, and mirin.

3. Cover with the lid and cook for 90 minutes on high pressure. Do a slow release and, after 20 minutes, open the lid. 
Note: If the pork is not submerged in the sauce, cook for 40 minutes and flip it over and cook for another 40 minutes. 

4. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and sear all sides of the pork until it's golden brown.
OR use an electric pressure cooker by selecting the ""Saute"" function and press ""Adjust"" button to switch to ""More"" for browning. Sear all sides of pork until it turns golden brown.

5. Once the pork is cooled down, transfer the meat and sauce to a large sealed container or a zip-top bag. Put it in the refrigerator overnight or until it's completely cool. This way the pork is easier to slice thinly after cooling, and this also gives the pork more flavor.

6. When it's ready to serve, skim off the fatty oil on the surface. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and strain the sauce. Reserve the sauce for marinating soft-boiled eggs or for making more pork belly. 

7. Take out the butcher twine. Cut the meat thinly using a very sharp knife. Reheat the slices in soup broth or heat it in a saucepan with the sauce until hot.

**Recipe Notes**

• If rolling up the pork is too much work, you can cook the slab for 1 hour in a pressure cooker, but there'll be a difference in texture.
• Freeze the marinated soy sauce for another use if needed.
• I don't recommend using pork belly without skin.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/77xvr0/meltinyourmouth_japanese_rolled_chashu_marinated/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/77xvr0/meltinyourmouth_japanese_rolled_chashu_marinated/

I made a few days ago after an afternoon run and it was a nice treat after a good workout! You can also add other veggies on the side – I like pan-fried Kimchi. If interested, [watch how I made it]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70-kmJPZihU)

##### What do I need (Serving size for 4):
- Pork loin – 4 pieces, each piece around 80~100 grams
- Flour –  1 cup
- Breadcrumbs or Panko – 3 cups
- Eggs – 2
- Salt – few shakes
- Black pepper – few shakes

##### How do I make it? 
- Season each pork chop with salt and pepper. Then wrap each in a plastic wrap.
- Tenderize and flatten the meat to about 1/4 inch or 1/8 inch thick (if you are hungry, keep it thick). Use any hard object like the bottom of a wine bottle or bottom of your knife. Keep the plastic on the meat when you are pounding so it doesn’t stick!
- Put the pork chops in the refrigerator for an hour so the meat can firm up before coating and frying
- Prepare three bowls – one with flour, one with beaten eggs and the last one with breadcrumbs
- Coat the pork chops first into the flour, then into the eggs and finally coat thoroughly with the bread crumbs (make sure you get in there with your hands and cover every nook and cranny!)
- Bring the oil up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (~170 Celsius) on medium-high heat. Then fry the pork cutlet until both sides are golden brown, turning them over a few times with tongs. (It will take roughly 10 minutes)
- Mix the pancake batter throughly  
- Turn on high heat to get the frying pan hot. Then add oil and reduce to a medium heat. Use a soup ladle and pour two spoonfuls of batter. Press down on the batter with the soup ladle and gently mold into a circle      
- Fry on each side for 30 seconds and check that each side turns golden brown (check on them and leave longer if you need)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for Curry:**

\* 7 oz Raw king prawns - (200g) You can use frozen ones

\* 10 oz White fish - (300g) Cod or Haddock

\* 2 cans Coconut milk

\* 3 tbsp Red curry paste

\* 3 Potatoes, medium sized - (16oz) peeled and diced

\* 1 Carrot, large

\* 1 oz Spinach - a good handful

\* ½ Lime, juice only

\* Salt to taste

\* Fish sauce - (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

**Garnish:**

\* Fresh coriander

\* Chilli flakes

\* Sweet chilli paste

&amp;#x200B;

**To Serve:**

\* 8.5 oz Rice vermicelli noodles - (240g)

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

**1.** In a blender, combine the roughly chopped white fish fillets and one can of coconut cream. Blend until smooth. This unique blend will serve as the creamy base for your curry.

**2.** In a large saucepan or wok, heat a bit of oil over medium heat. Add the red curry paste and fry for a minute or two until it becomes aromatic. This step is crucial for releasing the flavors of the curry.

**3.** Pour the blended fish-coconut mixture into the saucepan with the curry paste. Mix well to ensure the curry paste is evenly distributed.

**4.** Add the second can of coconut cream to the saucepan and stir well. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce will begin to thicken and the flavors will meld together.

**5.** Add the diced potatoes and sliced carrots to the simmering sauce. Cover and let it simmer for approximately 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

**6.** Once the vegetables are cooked, add the king prawns to the curry. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and fully cooked. Be cautious not to overcook them.

**7.** Fold in a handful of fresh spinach right before you're ready to serve. The residual heat will wilt the spinach without overcooking it.

**8.** Taste and adjust the seasoning of your curry. You might want to add salt, a splash of lime juice for a tangy kick, and a little fish sauce for extra umami. If to thick adjust with a little bit of water.

**9.** Garnish with fresh coriander if desired, and serve your Thai-style fish and prawn curry while it's warm. It pairs beautifully with rice vermicelli noodles for a complete meal, offering a delightful texture contrast to the creamy curry.

Main Ingredients

* 2 seabass fillets
* 1 spring onion (only the green bit)

* 1 teaspoon of Chinese cooking wine
* 2 tablespoons of sugar
* 2 tablespoons of Chinese white rice vinegar

Optional Marinate Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon of Chinese cooking wine
* 0.5 teaspoon of ground white pepper
* 0.5 cup of water
* 1 piece of ginger, julienned
* 1 spring onion (only the white bit), julienned

&amp;#x200B;

Instructions

1. (optional marinating step) If you are cooking for a picky eater that can’t stand strong fishy taste like my daughter, this step is very important. Julienne 1 piece of fresh ginger, and 1 spring onion, the white part only. Pour 0.5 cup of water in the container and a tsp of Chinese cooking wine. Add 0.5 tsp of ground white pepper. Rub the ginger and spring onion with your fingers and mix well, let it sit.
2. Cut your fish fillets into approximately 3x5cm bitable sizes.
3. Place your fish fillets skin down. With your knife at a slight 45 degree angle, carefully cut the meat, just deep enough to reach the skin beneath without actually cutting through the skin. Next, cut the fish fillets crosswise (again, at a 45 degree angle).
4. Place your fillets in the marinate bow, gently rub them and make sure all of them are coated evenly in the marinating juice. Leave it aside for 5 mins, take them out and dry them. (if you do not wish to marinate them, move to step 5.
5. Chop your red bell pepper into 1x1cm cubes. My daughter loves sweetcorns, so I added 3 table spoons of reduce-salt canned sweetcorn.
6. Julienne 1 piece of fresh ginger and 1 spring onion (only the green bit).
7. Put all the sweet and sour sauce ingredients in a bowl, mix well, set aside.
8. Beat the egg well.
9. Coat your fish fillets with egg, and drain excessive egg.
10. Coat your fish fillets with cornflour, and make sure you also coat the cracks of your cross-patterned cuts.
11. Pour around 500g vegetable oil into a pot, bringing it to around 160 °C / 320 °F.
12. Carefully place your fish fillets in and fry until light brown.
13. Take them out, let cool, and fry a second time until golden brown, place them aside.
14. Warm up a frying pan, add a tablespoon of oil, let it heat up.
15. Add julienned ginger, spring onion, sweetcorn and belt pepper in, stir fry for 1 min.
16. Mix your bowl of sweet and sour sauce again, pour it carefully in your frying pan, keep stirring until it thickens.
17. Turn off your hob, put your fried fish fillets in, toss them around, make sure they are evenly coated by the sauce.
18. Plate and enjoy with some rice!

Serves: 4

**Fish salpicón:**

* 1 cup loosely packed cilantro, minced
* 4 scallions, trimmed and minced; a few scallion greens reserved for garnish
* 1 bird’s eye chili, trimmed and minced; or use a small serrano or jalapeño
* ½ small red onion, peeled and minced
* 1 lime, juiced and zested
* 1 pound tilapia or cod
* 1 cup Wondra or all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil, plus more if needed
* Salt and pepper

**For serving:**

* Sliced radishes
* Sliced cucumber
* 8 small tortillas
* Guacamole or diced avocado

**Roasted potatoes:**

* 1½ pounds red potatoes, scrubbed and medium-diced
* 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon neutral oil
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* Cayenne powder to taste, optional
* 1 red bell pepper, trimmed, seeded, and roughly chopped
* ½ small red onion, peeled and roughly chopped
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Start the salpicón:**

1. Combine the minced cilantro, scallions, chili pepper, red onion, lime juice, and zest in a large bowl. Sprinkle lightly with salt and set aside.

**Make the roasted potatoes:**

1. Preheat oven to 425ºF.
2. Arrange the potatoes on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle the garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne powder if using. Mix to coat well and arrange in an even layer. Transfer to the oven for 15 minutes.
3. After 15 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and add the red bell pepper and red onion to the baking sheet. Drizzle with a teaspoon of neutral oil and sprinkle salt on top of the pepper and onion before mixing gently into the potatoes. Arrange in an even layer and return to the oven for 20–25 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the baking sheet in the warm oven as you finish the rest of the recipe.

**Cook the fish:**

1. Add 1 tablespoon neutral oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pat the tilapia dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Add the Wondra to a large bowl. Dip each tilapia filet in the Wondra and coat the fish evenly. Shake off any excess flour.
3. Transfer the fish to the hot skillet and cook in an even layer. Cook in batches if needed so as not to crowd the skillet. Fry until golden brown and crisp, about 3–5 minutes per side. As the filets reach 145ºF, transfer them to the bowl of minced herbs.
4. Once all the fish finishes cooking, use two forks to flake into the minced herbs and lime juice. Taste and adjust the seasonings.

**Ingredients**

* Scallops: I used 1lb of frozen scallops with their shells to serve two. Fresh scallops taste better of course, but they're pricier and less convenient. The shells aren't essential but are nice for presentation.
* Glass noodles: As many or as little as you like, it's really flexible. That mound you see in the picture was maybe 200g, which is a pretty conservative amount for two people.
* Plenty of minced garlic and butter, much more than you think you need.
* A tiny amount of soy sauce, maybe about a teaspoon per portion. You can always add, but you can't take away.
* Optional garnishes: scallions, red chilis, cilantro

**Instructions**

1. Rehydrate glass noodles in fresh water for a couple of hours, or with hot water for an hour
2. Finely slice scallion greens and a chilli pepper and reserve for garnish. Bring a pan of water to boil, for steaming the scallops later.
3. Peel and finely mince garlic cloves. Using a second pan, gently sweat minced garlic in butter until fragrant. Make sure it looks like you have more garlic and butter than you need.
4. Give the rehydrated glass noodles a few snips with kitchen shears, and mix into the garlic and butter. Season with soy sauce, stir to combine.
5. Arrange scallops on a heat-resistant plate. Top scallops with glass noodle and garlic butter mixture.
6. Steam scallops in the pain over vigorously boiling water for a few minutes. In the meantime, stir fry vegetables in residual butter and garlic in the second pan.

* Add the chopped tomatoes and the cherry tomatoes and cook for 3-4 minutes more. Melt the butter into the pot. Once frothy, add the white wine and bring to a boil for 5 minutes to allow the wine to reduce slightly.

Simmer the Broth:

* Add the stock, starting with 2 cups. Season everything in the pot with salt, pepper, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes. Adding more stock, as necessary, if too much cooks off. There should be enough broth to coat about 1/4'' of the bottom of the pan, but it should not be soupy.

Cook the Risotto:

* First, warm the chicken stock (either in a small saucepan on the stove or in a large glass measuring cup in the microwave).
* Melt the butter into the large sauce pan over medium heat. Once melted, add the rice and cook, stirring regularly, until it begins to toast and turn golden brown, about 4-5 minutes.
* Ladle 1-2 cups of the broth into the rice and stir regularly. Once the liquid is mostly absorbed (do not let the rice stick), add another 1-2 cups. Continue adding ladles of stock until all of the stock is mostly absorbed and the rice is tender but not mushy, about 16-20 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest for 5 minutes. Season with salt.

Cook the Shrimp:

* As the risotto finishes cooking, add the shrimp to the broth and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-7 minutes until opaque and cooked through. Do not overcook. Turn off the heat and keep warm. Taste and season again to your preferences.

To Serve:

* Add a few ladles of the spicy shrimp to the pot of risotto and stir gently to incorporate. Divide the risotto between plates and pile more spicy shrimp on top. Garnish with parsley and extra virgin olive oil, if desired. Enjoy!

**Instructions**

  
**Roast Red Peppers:**  
1. Pre-heat oven to 450F  
2. Lightly oil red peppers and cook in the oven for 15 mins  
3. Turn peppers 90 degrees so remainder can cook for another 15 mins until blackened/blistered  
4. Remove from oven, tent with foil and set aside (note: you can also put them into a Tupperware with a closed lid so they will steam and make for easier peeling)

  
**Cook and Peel Shrimp:**  
1. You can cook the shrimp one of two ways, depending on your equipment:  
\- Steam - in a medium saucepan, bring 1/2 cup water to boil, add shrimp and cover for \~3 mins until shrimp turn pink.  
\- Sauté - in a medium frying pan/wok/skillet, heat pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tbsp oil, sauté shrimp for 2-3 mins per side flipping once.  
2. Set aside to cool

  
**Prep your veg**  
1. Fine dice onion, celery and carrot and set aside (can be combined in one bowl)  
2. Mince garlic and shallot and set aside (can be combined in another bowl, separate from onion, celery, carrot)

  
**Make Shrimp Stock**  
1. Peel shrimp, separating shells and shrimp into two bowls  
2. Sprinkle shrimp with old bay, then put into the fridge to stay cool  
3. Melt 1 tbsp butter in saucepan over medium heat  
4. Add shells to saucepan, sauté on medium for \~5 mins til red and vibrant  
5. Add 3 cups chicken stock, 2 bay leaves, 3 smashed cloves garlic  
6. Bring to boil and simmer for 25 minutes

**Start building the Bisque**  
1. Add 2 tbsp olive oil to soup pot (at least 6-8 quart capacity) over medium heat  
2. Sauté onion, celery, carrot, and pinch of salt til soft and fragrant about 5 mins (Note: just trying to “sweat” these veg, not caramelize)  
3. Add garlic and shallots, sauté until fragrant (\~2-3 mins)  
4. Add sherry wine, and cook 3-4 mins until alcohol is cooked off  
5. Add Strained shrimp stock, can of coconut milk, 1/2 tbsp paprika, pinch red pepper flakes  
6. Mix to combine, and then set aside to cool

  
**Peel Red Pepper**  
1. While Bisque base is cooling, peel the skins off of the red pepper, remove stem and core so you just have the flesh

  
**Blend together**  
*Note: blending hot liquids can be super dangerous as the steam released from the food can blow the top off the blender if not sufficiently cooled or safely done. There's a great video by America’s Test Kitchen on the subject and how to do it safely.*  
1. Blend cooled (warm/lukewarm is fine) soup in batches with the bell pepper to get smooth  
2. Return to soup pot over medium heat to bring it back up to temperature and ensure it is well-combined

  
**Serve**  
1. Cut shrimp into 1/2 or 1/3 pieces so they can fit onto a soup spoon  
2. Pour soup into bowls and top with shrimp and Old Bay to taste  
3. Pair with bread (toasted sourdough slides are my favorite)",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13f0b1w/shrimp_and_red_pepper_bisque_dairyfree/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/13f0b1w/shrimp_and_red_pepper_bisque_dairyfree/

12dwv7k,Saffron Cod and Orzo with Guanciale Chili Oil and Frizzled Leeks,186,9,1680812863.0,0.96,Seafood,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/i792s7kypbsa1.jpg,"**Recipe here originally: [Saffron Cod and Orzo with Guanciale Chili Oil](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/saffron-cod-and-orzo-with-guanciale-chili-oil/)**

**Frizzled leeks:**

* 1 leek, white and light green parts only, scrubbed and rinsed
* Vegetable oil

**Guanciale chili oil:**

* 4 ounces guanciale, bacon, or pancetta; small-diced
* 1 small shallot, peeled and finely diced
* 1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste
* ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
* ¼ cup chili oil
* 1–2 teaspoons maple syrup
* Pinch of salt, if needed

**Saffron cod and orzo:**

* Pinch of saffron, lightly crushed
* 2 tablespoons hot water
* 6 4-ounce portions of cod
* 1 fennel bulb with stalks; bulb cored and thinly sliced, stalks trimmed and thinly sliced into rounds, fronds reserved for garnish
* 1 shallot, peeled and sliced lengthwise into thin wedges
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 16 ounces orzo
* 5½ cups water or vegetable broth
* 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 lemon, juiced
* ¼ cup loosely packed parsley, minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prep the leek:**

1. Before beginning, prepare the leek as it takes the most time. Halve the leek lengthwise and very thinly slice both halves into 1/8-inch wide slivers. You may need to separate some of the layers of the leek and slice each layer separately. If you find bits of dirt deep within the leek, don’t fret. You can place all the leek slivers in a sieve and rinse again once more to remove any stubborn flecks of dirt.
2. Transfer the sliced leek to a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry to remove any excess water.

**Steep the saffron:**

1. Place the crushed saffron in a small bowl and cover it with 2 tablespoons of hot water. Set aside.

**Prepare the guanciale chili oil:**

1. Place the guanciale in a large pot (you’ll use this pot later for the orzo and cod!) and turn the heat to medium. Cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes until the fat renders and the guanciale becomes crispy.
2. Add the shallot, garlic, and crushed red pepper and cook for an additional 3 minutes, turning often and adjusting the heat as needed to prevent the garlic from browning. Once the shallot softens, and the garlic takes on a very light golden color, spoon the mixture into a bowl. Scoop out all but a tablespoon of the fat from the pot and add it to the bowl of guanciale.
3. Pour the extra virgin olive oil, chili oil, and maple syrup over the guanciale. Stir vigorously to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add more maple syrup, chili oil, or crushed red pepper, depending on your preferences.
4. The guanciale oil will keep in an airtight jar for up to 5 days.

**Prepare the saffron cod and orzo:**

1. Pat the cod dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Return the pot of remaining guanciale fat to medium heat. Add the sliced fennel bulb and stalks along with the sliced shallot. Season with salt and cook for 5–6 minutes until the fennel begins to soften.
3. Add the garlic and cook for 1–2 minutes until just fragrant.
4. Melt the butter into the pot and add the orzo. Stir to coat and cook for 1–2 minutes until it begins to lightly toast. Season with salt.
5. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil for 2–3 minutes. Stir often to lift up any orzo that may have stuck to the bottom.
6. Reduce heat to low and arrange the cod on top. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Drizzle the steeped saffron mixture all over, ensuring that each piece of cod gets a little bit of saffron water.
7. Cover and simmer over low heat for 12–15 minutes or until the cod is opaque and the orzo is tender.

**Frizzle the leek:**

1. *Note: Use a saucepan that has somewhat high sides. Generally, you want a saucepan that’s at least 6–8 inches deep. When you add the leeks to the hot oil, the oil will foam up vigorously, and you do NOT want it pouring over the edges.*
2. As the cod simmers, make the leeks. In a saucepan, pour in 2 inches of vegetable oil. Turn the heat to medium-high. Break off a piece of leek and add it to the pot; if it bubbles rapidly, it’s ready to fry.
3. Working in small batches, add a handful of the leeks at a time to the oil. Stir occasionally and fry for 15–20 seconds until golden brown. Remove and–using tongs–transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Continue on until all the leeks are fried. Pat any excess oil off from the tops of the leeks with a paper towel and season with flaky sea salt. Set aside.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the cooked orzo into shallow bowls and place a piece of cod on top. Arrange the frizzled leeks next to the cod and drizzle with the guanciale chili oil. Sprinkle a few bits of fennel fronds on top if you remember (unlike me…).

Prep Time: 45 minutes

Cook Time: 1 hour

Total Time: 1 hour 45 minutes 

Servings: 12 tacos 

Calories: 304kcal

**Equipment**

* Whisk
* Food processor
* Skillet or baking sheet
* Large pot
* Meat or deep-fry thermometer

**Ingredients**

**Slaw:**

* ½ small head green or red cabbage, trimmed and sliced paper-thin
* ½ small red onion, peeled and sliced paper-thin
* 1 serrano or jalapeño pepper, trimmed and minced
* ⅓ cup loosely packed cilantro, minced
* ¼ cup distilled white vinegar
* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
* 1 lime, juiced
* Salt

**Jalapeño-avocado cream cheese:**

* ¼ of a small red onion, peeled
* 1–2 jalapeños or serrano peppers, depending on heat tolerance, trimmed
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 large avocado, halved, peeled, and pit discarded
* ⅓ cup loosely packed cilantro
* 1 lime, juiced
* 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
* Salt

**Beer-battered cod:**

* 1½ pounds cod, patted dry and cut into 1-inch cubes
* 1½ cups flour
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 2 teaspoons salt, plus more as needed
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon cayenne powder
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder
* 16- ounce can of Corona or your favorite lager or pilsner
* Veggie or peanut oil, for frying (you’ll need a couple cups!)

**For serving:**

* 3–4 radishes, trimmed and thinly sliced
* 1 small cucumber, sliced into rounds
* ¼ red onion, minced
* ⅓ cup loosely packed cilantro, minced
* Small flour or corn tortillas; I recommend 2–3 per person
* Sliced serrano or jalapeño, thinly sliced
* 1 lime, cut into wedges

**Prepare the slaw:**

1. Place the cabbage, red onion, serrano pepper, and cilantro in a large bowl. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pour the lime juice on top.
2. In a microwave-safe bowl, add the vinegar and sugar. Microwave for 1 minute until the sugar is dissolved. Let stand for 5–10 minutes.
3. Add the mayonnaise and whisk until completely smooth.
4. Pour the dressing over the cabbage and toss to combine. Taste and season to your preferences. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.

**Prepare the jalapeño-avocado cream cheese:**

1. Turn on your oven’s broiler to high.
2. Place the red onion and jalapeños in a small oven-proof skillet or baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil. Transfer to the oven under the broiler. Broil for 3–5 minutes (depending on the intensity of your broiler) until the peppers begin to blister and blacken. Remove and set aside.
3. Combine the avocado, cilantro, lime juice, charred jalapeño, and red onion in a food processor. Place the cream cheese on top and pulse until completely smooth and creamy. Taste and season with salt. Pour into an airtight jar or a bowl and cover tightly with foil. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.

**Make the cod:**

1. Pour oil into a large pot, about 3 inches deep, and heat the oil to 350º–375ºF. Note: If you don’t have a deep fat thermometer, use an instant-read meat thermometer, provided the stem is long enough! You’ll want to regularly check the oil’s temperature and ensure you stay at a consistent 350ºF–375ºF.
2. Pat the cod pieces dry and season lightly with salt. Set aside.
3. Combine the flour, chili powder, salt, baking powder, paprika, cayenne powder, and garlic powder in a bowl.
4. Pour in the beer and whisk until completely smooth and free of lumps. The batter will be thicker than cream but still a tad runny.
5. Place all of the cod pieces in the batter and toss to combine.
6. Using tongs, lift a piece of cod from the batter and lightly shake off any drippy excess batter. Slowly drop it into the hot oil. Fry 4–6 pieces at a time, depending on the width of your pot. Be sure not to overcrowd the pot! Cook for 3–4 minutes until golden brown all over. Use a slotted spoon to transfer a paper towel-lined plate. Continue frying in batches, checking and adjusting the temperature periodically.

**To serve:**

1. Arrange radishes, cucumber, red onion, cilantro, sliced jalapeño, and lime wedges on a serving platter.
2. To assemble the tacos, smear a spoonful of the jalapeño-avocado cream cheese onto a warm tortilla. Place a few cod nuggets on top and finish with a spoonful of slaw. Sprinkle minced red onion and cilantro on top. Add one or two slices of jalapeño on top for extra heat, if you like. Serve cucumber, lime wedges, and radishes on the side. Enjoy!

**Notes:**

For the recipe, you’ll use cilantro in the slaw, cream cheese, and for serving. Buy just 1 nice-sized bunch and divide it into 3 for each component.

You’ll also need to buy just 1 red onion (use half of it for the slaw, and the remaining half is used for the cream cheese and for serving).

**1.** To prepare the beetroot cure, blend beetroot, sugar, salt, vodka, and spices in a food processor for about 15 seconds.

**2.** Next, find a container large enough to fit the salmon and line it with a double layer of cling film wrap. Transfer half of the beetroot cure to the centre of the film and spread it to match the size of the salmon. Place the salmon on top and cover it with the remaining cure mixture, making sure to spread it over the top and all sides of the fish.

**3.** Tightly wrap the salmon in the cling film and place a weight on top of the fillet. Refrigerate for 48 hours. (While pressing the salmon is not necessary, it can increase the contact between the fillet and the cure).

**4.** After two days, remove the salmon from the container, unwrap it over the sink, wash off all the beetroot cure, and pat dry. Re-wrap the salmon in fresh cling film and store it in the refrigerator for up to one week, or vacuum pack it and store it for up to three weeks. (Once cured, handle the salmon gently as it becomes more fragile. For the cleanest cuts, use a very sharp knife when slicing.)

**How to prepare Fennel Slaw:**

**1.** In a mixing bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, mustard, the juice of one lemon, and lemon zest to make the dressing.

**2.** In another bowl, mix together sliced fennel, sliced onion, and grated carrot to form the slaw.

**3.** Just before serving, combine the dressing with the slaw mixture. Toss until the slaw is evenly coated with the dressing.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/111e92a/beetroot_cured_salmon/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/111e92a/beetroot_cured_salmon/

103an4j,Sesame Salmon Sushi Bowls,1572,34,1672856231.0,0.98,Seafood,yellowjacquet,https://i.redd.it/015gmv1g04aa1.jpg,"# Sesame Salmon Sushi Bowls

These are poke bowl style, but use seasoned sushi rice as the base. If you would rather make this as a poke bowl, skip the sushi rice section and just use plain white rice. You can easily customize these with whatever extra toppings you like.

**Original Recipe**: [https://craftycookbook.com/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls/](https://craftycookbook.com/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls/)

**Time:** 50 mins

**Servings:** 2 XL bowls (as pictured) or 3-4 smaller servings

**Ingredients**

*For Sushi Rice:*

* 1 1/2 cups medium grain sushi rice
* 1 3/4 cups warm water
* 6 tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar *(This should have no calories. If it has calories, the vinegar is already seasoned with sugar and salt.)*
* 2 tbsp white sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp table salt

*For Sesame Salmon:*

* 6-10 oz sushi quality salmon (pictured is 5 oz per bowl)\*\*
* 2 green onions
* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp toasted white sesame seeds

*To Finish Bowls:*

* 1/2 medium-sized ripe avocado, optional
* \~1/2 cup shelled, frozen edamame, optional
* \~1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion, optional
* \~1/4 cup daikon sprouts, optional
* other veggies such as carrots, cucumber, nori, bean sprouts, etc optional

\*\*I purchase fish marked for sushi/sashimi from a Japanese grocery store, but this isn't the only option available.

**To Prepare Sushi Rice:**

1. The rice takes about 50 minutes to prepare, but has a lot of hands-off time. The salmon and veggies for this meal can be prepared as the rice cooks. Optionally, you can substitute plain white rice to make this recipe as a poke bowl instead.
2. Place the rice in a large pot (that has a lid). Rinse and drain the rice until the water runs clear, at least 3 times (rinse the rice even if the bag says it's ""prewashed""). Drain as much water as possible.
3. Add 1 3/4 cup lukewarm water to the pot, close with the lid, and place on the stove top.
4. Heat over medium-high heat until the water begins to boil, once boiling cook over medium-high heat for 4 minutes, then reduce heat to very-low and simmer for 15 minutes.
5. After simmering, remove from heat and let the pot stand undisturbed for another 15 minutes.
6. Scoop the rice into a large non-metallic bowl. Dust with sugar and salt, then pour over the rice vinegar. Using a rice spatula or non-stick spatula mix everything together and break up all the clumps of rice. Mix until every grain of rice is separated and coated in vinegar, the sugar and salt should dissolve completely. Don't worry if the rice seems too wet at this point, that will go away as it cools.
7. Allow the rice to cool uncovered, mixing occasionally, until it reaches room temp (about 15 minutes). You can speed this process along by fanning the rice if desired. The rice should be slightly sticky once it's cooled.

**To Prepare Veggies:**

1. Boil the edamame per package instructions (typically 3-4 minutes), then drain and season lightly with salt.
2. Peel the red onion and cut it in half, then slice as thin as possible until you have about 1/4 of a cup.
3. Clip daikon sprouts from their base and thoroughly rinse.
4. Prepare the avocado last, as it will brown if exposed to air for too long. Peel and thinly slice the 1/2 avocado as desired.

**To Prepare Sesame Salmon:**

1. Rinse the salmon thoroughly, then pat dry with paper towels. Using a very sharp chef's knife, slice the salmon into strips. Once in strips, slice again into cubes. You do not need a sushi knife, a sharp chef's knife will do. I make my cubes about 1/2 inch in size, but choose any size you prefer.
2. Remove the root tip of the green onions and discard, then slice as thinly as possible (green and white portions). After slicing, use your hands to separate the rings of the white portion as much as possible.
3. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the cubed salmon, green onion, sesame oil, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Mix until fully combined. *If not using immediately, cover and return to the fridge until ready to use.*

**To Finish Bowls:**

1. Divide the sushi rice evenly into the serving dishes, creating a wide, flat base.
2. Spoon the salmon into the serving bowls, discarding any sauce that remains in the mixing bowl. 
3. Top with veggies as desired, then serve immediately with a spoon and chopsticks.

Serving size: 2-3 crepes per person.

Makes 6 – 8” Crepes Katherine

For the crepes:

The crepes may be made in advance and heated slightly in a warm oven before filling

Ingredients:

* 4 Large eggs
* Milk – Measure the volume of the eggs and use an equal volume of milk
* Flour – Half the volume of the eggs
* Dash of salt
* Butter (or non-stick cooking spray)

Directions:

1. Blend eggs, milk, flour, and salt together until lumps are removed and allow to rest refrigerated in an airtight container for one hour, up to overnight, before cooking.
2. Preheat non-stick saute pan over medium-low heat. Whisk or shake the egg mixture until completely combined.
3. For each crepe, melt a very thin slice of butter in the heated pan swirling until the bottom of the pan is coated, or spray the bottom of the pan with non-stick cooking spray.
4. Pour roughly a quarter of a cup of the batter onto the pan, tilting and rotating the pan off the heat to ensure a very thin layer of batter is completely covering the bottom of the pan. Additional batter may be added as needed, but should only be done within the first few moments following the initial pour.
5. Return the pan to the heat and allow to cook for 1-2 minutes, until the crepe is able to slide freely in the bottom of the pan.
6. Using a spatula, flip the crepe and cook the other side for 15 seconds. When finished cooking remove from pan and return pan to heat for next crepe.

For the salmon mousse filling:

The filling may be made in advance and kept in a covered refrigerated container until used. The filling may be then used chilled or heated.

Ingredients:

* 10 oz. uncooked salmon, or 8 oz of cooked or smoked salmon. If using uncooked salmon, then the salmon should be cooked and skin and bones removed before using in the mousse. The salmon may be cooked however is preferred, but seasoning should be kept to a minimum
* 4 oz cream cheese, softened to room temperature
* ½ tsp salt (or salt to taste if the salmon is already seasoned with salt)
* ½ tsp olive oil
* ½ tsp minced garlic (or 1 clove, minced)
* Juice of ½ lemon (about 2 Tbsp)
* 1 tsp fresh or dried dill
* Other optional seasonings include black pepper, cayenne, celery salt, onion salt. Each added to taste.
* Optional mix-ins include diced pepper (bell or poblano), diced or minced onion or shallot, thin-sliced scallions, diced celery

Directions:

1. Using a hand mixer or blender, combine the salmon, cream cheese, salt, olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice,  into a puree. If using a hand mixer, the cream cheese should first be mixed before adding the salmon and other ingredients.
2. If using a blender, empty the now pureed salmon mousse into a small mixing bowl. Stir in dill and other seasonings, to taste.
3. The optional mix-ins can be folded into the mousse directly or arranged on top of the mousse after it has been spread on a crepe, before the crepe is folded.

For the hollandaise sauce:

* 1 cup of hollandaise sauce may be prepare using any preferred method. A dash of white wine may be added to the prepared sauce. The sauce should be heated at the moment of plating as most of the heat of the dish will be coming from the sauce.

For the asparagus:

* 3-8 spears of asparagus per plate should be cooked per any preferred method. Thinner spears may be cooked directly in a sauté pan while thicker spears may be oven-baked, or parboiled then sauteed.

For the crab:

* 2-4 Tbsp of cooked and shredded crab per person. Canned crab meat may be used if fresh isn’t available. This can be any preferred type of crab and may be optionally coated lightly with melted butter. 1 cluster of snow crab legs provides enough for two plates.

Final preparation and plating:

1. For each crepe, lay the crepe flat and spread a layer of the salmon mouse thinly on one half of the crepe surface. Add any optional ingredients on top of the salmon mousse spread. After spreading, fold the unspread side of the crepe over the top of the spread side to form a semi-circle of the crepe filled with salmon mouse. Fold that semi-circle once more to form a quarter circle.
2. Artfully arrange the crepes on the plates, typically overlapped.
3. Pour the hollandaise sauce over the crepes arrangement on each plate, carefully avoiding pouring too much.
4. Artfully arrange the asparagus spears on the hollandaise sauce over the middle of the crepes.
5. Place 2-4 Tbsp of crab meat in the center of each arrangement of asparagus spears. Garnish with fresh parsley.

If you like this recipe I would really appreciate a visit to my independent website [Leviathan Food](https://www.leviathanfood.com/), where there are plenty more that I developed.

**INGREDIENTS**

* 12 scallops
* 300ml sunflower oil
* 15g fresh ginger
* 2 heaped tbsp. gochugaru
* 1 - 2 heaped tbsp. chilli flakes
* 2 large scallions
* 4 garlic cloves
* 1 1/2 tsp. white sugar
* 2 tbsp. black sesame seeds
* 1 lemon
* 3 star anise
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 2 tbsp. tamari
* 1 tbsp. rice wine vinegar

**METHOD**

1.) Finely chop the scallions, garlic and ginger. Add half the sunflower oil to a pot on a medium heat. When it has come up to temperature add the scallions and cook for about three minutes. The oil will bubble as the water cooks out of them. Make sure they do not brown. Add the ginger, star anise and cinnamon and cook for another two minutes, stirring every so often, before adding the garlic and continuing to cook.

2.) In a bowl combine the gochugaru, sugar, black sesame seeds and chilli flakes. one tbsp. of chilli will give you a milder rāyu. If you like more of a kick you can add an extra spoonful. Add the mixture in the the pot and top off with the remainder of the oil. Stir well, and cook over a low to medium heat on a gentle and constant simmer for 12 - 15 minutes, taking care not to allow anything to burn or brown too much.

3.) Add the tamari and the rice wine vinegar and stir. Turn the heat off and allow to cook before placing in a sterilised jar. This should keep in the fridge for a few weeks.

4.) Remove scallops from the fridge to come to room temperature. Add oil and butter to a pan on a high heat. Pat them dry and season with coarse salt and pepper before placing in the pan flat side down. Push them down slightly and cook for about two minutes until a deep golden colour. Turn and cook or another minute or two. Baste with the butter. They should be springy to the touch and just warm in the centre when tested with a metal skewer.

5.) Add a tbsp. of the chilli oil to a plate and arrange three scallops around it. Spoon some of the chunkier pieces of the rāyu over the top and season. A squeeze of lemon juice and some grated zest elevates the dish.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tw96z7/seared_scallops_with_black_sesame_rāyu/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tw96z7/seared_scallops_with_black_sesame_rāyu/

The mussel season just started in Europe and we took a chance on making Moules Frites at home. Turns out, it's not as difficult as thought, but tastes better than anticipated, for I usually am not a big fan of mussels.

**Enjoy the recipe and** [**United Cuisines on YouTube!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxzYaCMICGw)

INGREDIENTS:

*Classic Belgian mussels*

\- 1 onion

\- fresh mussels \[3 lb / 1.4 kg\]

\- butter \[2.5 oz / 70 g\]

\- 1 branch of celery

\- ground black pepper \[1/2 tbsp / 5 g\]

\- pinch of salt

\- a handful of parsley (optional)

*Crispy Belgian fries*

\- mealy, high-starch potatoes, such as Bintje \[1 lb / 450 g\]

\- rendered beef fat/tallow \[1.1 lb / 500 g\]

Servings: 2

INSTRUCTIONS

*Belgian “mosselen natuur”*

1. Wash and clean mussels in cold water. Remove their “beards”/fibers, place them in a bowl with water and set aside. INFO: Fresh mussels are still alive and should be closed. Tap them against each other, when open and they should close. If not, discard them, together with those whose shells are broken
2. Dice onions and celery. Chop parsley
3. Use (enamel) pots with handles and high sides. Place over medium heat, melt the butter and sauté the diced onion and celery for around 5 minutes
4. Mix in the ground black pepper and increase the heat to high
5. Grab as many mussels as you can by hand and quickly transfer them into the pot. Don’t fully drain the water!
6. Give your mussels a good mix, distributing the veggies among them, put on the lid and let cook over for 7 minutes. The mussels closest to the pot’s bottom, will open up and cook first. Hence, it’s important that you mix your mussels by shaking the pot without opening its lid. Do this 3x in those 7 minutes of cooking
7. The mussels should have all opened up and be cooked by now. Turn off the heat, mix in the parsley and keep the lid on, whilst we prepare your Belgian fries of your Moules Frites! INFO: Don’t eat mussels that didn’t open. Discard them!

*Belgian fries* 

1. Wash and peel the potatoes, before cutting them into 11-12mm \[0.45 inch\] thick fries. Transfer into a cold water bath and let soak for 30 minutes
2. Drain the fries, spread them over a baking sheet, that you covered with some kitchen towels and properly dab your potatoes dry. INFO: Belgian fries shall be fried twice: once on low and once on high temperature.
3. Place the beef tallow into a deep pot and let melt over medium-high heat
4. Once the oil temperature hits 140°C \[280°F\], drop the first batch of fries in there. Don’t overcrowd the pot and mix well right away. Let fry for 5 minutes
5. The surface of your fries will turn a bit white-ish in color: those are burst starch granules that start to gelatinize. Now it’s time to get them out of the hot oil, drain and place them on paper towels on your baking sheet, where they shall cool down for 20 minutes. Fry the other batches while you wait, or take the pot off the heat
6. Once fries cooled down, bring up the oil’s temperature up to around 190°C \[370°F\], put one pre-fried batch in, and immediately give them a short stir. Fry for 3-5 minutes, till the potatoes start to slightly float and golden in color
7. When the potatoes are done, drain and transfer them into a bowl, covered with kitchen paper and immediately salt before mixing them
8. Enjoy! Bon appétit and eet smakelijk \[French and Dutch are spoken in Belgium\]

**INGREDIENTS:**

7g Shiitake Mushrooms

7g (5 inch/13 cm piece) Kombu

15g Bonito flakes

250mL (1 Cup) water

100g (about 100mL) Sugar

80mL (1/3 Cup) Balsamic Vinegar

250mL (1 Cup) Soy Sauce

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Soak Shiitake Mushrooms in cold water for about 6-8 hours ahead of time. Then slice into thin strips. Discard the water and rinse the mushrooms if you see too much dirt in the water.
2. Bring 1 cup of cold water with the Kombu to a boil, then take out the Kombu and discard. 
3. Add Shiitake Mushrooms, sugar, balsamic vinegar, and soy sauce to the same pot of water. Bring to a boil and turn off the heat. Cover it and let the flavors infuse for 1 hour.
4. After 1 hour, bring the liquid back to a boil the second time and add in Bonito flakes. Cover it for 5 minutes.
5. Strain the liquid into a wide pan through a fine mesh. Boil this liquid down to a syrup such that the sauce stays on the plate when you drag the sauce across the plate (see video if you need a reference).
6. If you reduced the sauce too much and has become too thick, add 2 tablespoons of water (repeat if needed) and mix to make it less viscous on the heat.
7. Let it cool down a bit first then transfer to a squeeze bottle (if you have one). Otherwise, any container to hold your sauce in the fridge is perfectly fine. 
8. It's important that you WAIT 24 HOURS before using your sauce. At this point, the sauce is too sharp to consume immediately. After 24 hours, all the flavors will round out.

Notes: With regard to extra Kombu, dry Shiitake Mushrooms, and Bonito flakes - these items will last almost indefinitely as long as you store them in a dry and cool place.  The ingredients that you strained out can be consumed if you wish, some people find it unpleasant to eat. The sauce can be kept in the fridge for a very long time.

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling  
3 medium shallots, finely diced (about 1 1/4 cups)  
5 large cloves garlic, minced  
Pinch red pepper flakes, optional  
Freshly ground black pepper  
3/4 cup dry white wine or dry vermouth  
2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest (from 1 large lemon)  
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 large lemon)  
1/4 cup finely chopped parsley leaves  
Directions  
Dry the shrimp and add them to a medium bowl; toss well with 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda. Return to the refrigerator and allow to sit for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.In a large skillet set over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter and the olive oil. Add the shrimp and arrange into an even layer. Cook until barely pink on bottom side, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook until shrimp are pink on the other side and no longer translucent in the middle, about 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove the shrimp to a plate and set aside.

  
If the pan looks dry, add another tablespoon olive oil. Add the shallots and cook, stirring often, until they begin to soften, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until soft and fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add wine and bring to a boil. Let the simmer for 1 minute; add the rest of the butter and swirl and stir the pan until the butter melts. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice and parsley. Return the shrimp to the pan and toss until shrimp are hot and coated in sauce.  
Serve hot, over pasta or with crusty bread for soaking up the sauce.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/oz689z/garlicbutter_shrimp_scampi/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/oz689z/garlicbutter_shrimp_scampi/

**Enjoy the recipe and** [**our United Cuisines show on Youtube!**](https://youtu.be/sF9TbhAMF7s)

*INGREDIENTS:*

\- lime juice \[1 cup / 250 ml\]

\- orange juice \[2 tbsp / 30 ml\]

\- red onion \[medium-size\]

\- one normal tomato

\- cherry tomatoes \[5 oz / 150 gram\]

\- ketchup \[1-2 tbsp\]

\- one green or red (bell) pepper \[small-size\]

\- cilantro \[a handful\]

\- shrimp meat \[0.5 lbs / 220 gram\]

\- salt \[to taste\]

Servings: 4

*INSTRUCTIONS:*

1. Slice onion in thin long stripes. Don't dice it! Let onions soak in salt water for 15 minutes
2. Process your sweet cherry tomatoes into a juicy mass. If not sweet/tasty enough for your taste, add 1-2 tbsp of ketchup
3. Dice the tomato and red pepper in small cubes. Chop the fresh cilantro
4. Press out the lime juice. You will need approximately one cup \[250ml\], enough to cover the shrimp meat
5. Clean and peel your shrimp down to its meat and, even though controversial for ceviche, we suggest that you poach it in boiling saltwater for 2 minutes. Simply to be 100% safe. Immediately transfer the cooked shrimp in ice-cold water, which will quickly stop the cooking process and help your shrimp to stay tender.
6. Cut the shrimp into small bite-size pieces and transfer into a **glass** bowl
7. Pour in lime juice and add all other ingredients. Sprinkle with the juice of half an orange and salt to taste
8. Mix thoroughly and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit in fridge for 1-2 hours
9. Serve with plantain chips, or if you can't find those, tortilla nacho chips go well with it, too. Enjoy!

The fish is both juicy and tender, and is infused with the aromatic flavor of the hot scallion oil. Additionally the sweetness of the seafood sauce is well balanced with the soy sauce.Any whitefish is a good choice for steaming such as tilapia, sea bass, red snapper, etc. Make sure the fish is as fresh as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

[A full video with detailed instructions can be found here.](https://youtu.be/FuPk7r5-5s4)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

\- 1lb sea bass

\- 4 scallions

\- 15g ginger

\- 1g Sichuan peppercorns (optional)

\- 3-4 dried chilies (optional)

\- 3 tbsps oil

&amp;#x200B;

Seafood sauce:

\- 3 tbsps soy sauce

\- 1 tbsp sesame oil

\- 1 tbsp black vinegar

\- 4 tbsps water

\- 1g salt

\- 4g sugar

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Have the fish gutted and descaled (most fishmongers do that for free).
2. Score the fish at a 45-degree angle for about three to four times on both sides. This will help the fish to cook through quickly and absorb more flavors.
3. Place 10 ginger slices inside the cut and the fish belly. Ginger is not only aromatic, it can also get rid of fishy smell. Place the fish on top of several scallion pieces on the plate so the fish will not touch the plate directly.
4. Bring the water to a rolling boil, then steam the fish over high heat for about 8 to 12 minutes (1-1.5lbs) depending on the size of your fish.
5. Make the seafood sauce using soy sauce, sesame oil, black vinegar, water, salt, and sugar.
6. When the time is up, discard all the liquid in the plate because that is the source of the bad fishy taste. Add the seafood sauce around the fish following the edge of the plate and spread the scallion strips on top of the fish.
7. Fry the scallions in 3 tbsps of oil over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Pour the hot oil over the fish. Enjoy! (I also used dried chilies and sichuan peppercorns in the oil to add a hint of spiciness and numbing sensation, but these two ingredients are optional.)",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/og8ih3/steamed_fish_with_hot_scallion_oil_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/og8ih3/steamed_fish_with_hot_scallion_oil_recipe/
n5svwf,Easy Clam Chowder,3409,97,1620254960.0,0.99,Seafood,yellowjacquet,https://i.redd.it/09wgxl4csdx61.jpg,"I LOVE clam chowder, it’s frequently my order if it’s on the menu, and back in the day I used to crack open the canned stuff for a quick dinner. Once I started making lots of homemade soups I found that I couldn’t go back to canned soup anymore, which was a bummer because I also didn’t want to go through the hassle of getting and handling fresh clams to make clam chowder myself. 

This recipe uses canned clams and it’s the perfect middle ground in my opinion! Canned clams are an excellent source of iron, and they are cheap and last for a long time in the pantry! 

# Ingredients

* 2  6.5 oz cans of clams
* 1  8 oz bottle of clam stock (clam juice) \*see note
* 2 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled and cut into \~1 cm cubes \*see note
* 4 strips of thick cut bacon (or 6 regular strips)
* 1 large white onion, diced
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 2 cups whole milk (can sub non-dairy)
* ¼ cup all-purpose flour
* ⅔ cup corn (from one cobb, or sub canned)
* 1 tbsp fresh thyme
* ½ cup shredded carrots (optional)
* 1 bay leaf (optional)
* Salt &amp; fresh cracked black pepper

# Instructions

1. Strain the clams over a measuring cup, reserving the liquid (should get about 1 cup total). Combined with the 8 oz bottle there will be 2 cups of clam stock, set this aside.
2. Heat a large, wide pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Cut the bacon into bite-sized pieces and cook it until it reaches your desired level of doneness (I like to let some get crispy and pull some off a little sooner). Remove to a paper towel lined plate and leave the drippings in the pot. 
3. Add the onions to the pot and cook in the bacon drippings until they soften, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Add some extra olive oil if the bacon drippings don’t coat the bottom of the pot)
4. Add the potatoes, garlic, 1 tsp salt, and ¼ tsp pepper to the pot. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently.
5. Dust the flour evenly over the contents of the pot and cook, stirring frequently, for another \~3 minutes.
6. Add the milk and clam stock and stir until well-mixed. Add the bay leaf, thyme, carrots, and corn. Bring to a boil over high heat, and then reduce heat to medium-low to simmer until the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes (stirring occasionally to prevent potatoes from sticking to the pan's bottom). Add more salt and pepper to taste.
7. Add the clams and bacon bits to the soup 2-3 minutes before serving. Remove the bay leaf and serve the soup topped with more thyme and fresh cracked black pepper.

# Notes

* Serve in bread bowls or alongside crusty bread for dipping.
* Dicing the potatoes into small (\~1 cm) chunks is critical to the texture of the soup, the outsides of the pieces dissolve and contribute to the creaminess of the soup. If cut too large this won't be as effective.
* Clam stock (clam juice) can usually be found near the canned clams at the grocery store in 8 oz glass bottles.

# Ingredients 

* 8 to 12 oz calamari rings (8 oz is enough but 12 oz makes it very loaded!)
* 8 oz linguine (can sub similar long pasta)
* ¾  cup dry white wine (1 mini bottle)
* 1 medium shallot, finely diced
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic 
* ¼ cup panko bread crumbs
* 4 tbsp salted butter
* 2 tbsp fresh basil or thyme, roughly chopped 
* 2 ½ tbsp olive oil, divided
* ½ tsp salt (+ more to taste)

1. Rinse calamari rings then thoroughly pat dry, removing as much moisture as possible.   

2. Begin boiling a large pot of salted water for the pasta and cook per package directions for al dente while completing the other steps. Drain pasta (do not rinse) and return to covered pot to keep warm until needed.  

3. Warm a large skillet with ½ tbsp of olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the panko and toast until it is golden brown and crispy. Set aside in a small bowl when done and wipe the pan clean.   
 
4. In the same skillet begin warming 2 tbsp of olive oil over medium/medium-high heat.  Once the oil is hot add the calamari and cook, stirring occasionally, until the calamari is cooked through (about 5 minutes). The calamari pieces should shrink and become more firm as they cook. Remove them from the skillet and cover with foil to keep warm, do not wipe the skillet clean.  

5. Reduce heat to medium and add the 4 tbsp of butter. Once hot, add the shallot and cook for about 2 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for another 2 or so, stirring frequently.   
 
6. Add the white wine to the skillet and bring to a boil. Allow the mixture to cook down for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally,  until most of the wine has boiled away. Season with ½ tsp of salt.  

7. Remove from heat and add the pasta and calamari to the skillet. Mix well, then add the basil or thyme and breadcrumbs and toss further (reserving a small bit of breadcrumbs and herbs for garnish). Plate then garnish with remaining breadcrumbs and herbs, serve immediately.

### Notes

If you like a spicier Gumbo replace smoked sausage with andouille sausage, making it 4 Links of Andouille and add another TBSP of Creole Seasoning.

I like to peel about 70% of the shrimp before I put in, this way most won't need peeling while you're eating but you still get the flavor from the shrimp shell from the remaining 30%.

The stock is flexible, you can use all Seafood, or all Chicken - I just like the blend of both.

While you may not see scallops in curry sauce all that often, believe me, these spicy coconut curry scallops are delicious!

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 25 minutes

Total Time: 35 minutes

Servings: 4 as an appetizer

## Equipment

* Wide pot

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 4 Roma tomatoes quartered
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon coconut curry paste (your favorite brand, Thai or Indian style... I used a Thiyal tamarind-coconut curry paste!)
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper optional
* 1 teaspoon chili powder optional
* 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* 1 cup coconut milk
* 1 pound scallops side muscle removed
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Cilantro or parsley leaves optional, for garnish
* Red pepper flakes optional, for garnish

## Instructions

## Char the Tomatoes:

* Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high. Once very hot and shimmering, add the tomatoes, cut-side down, and cook without moving for 3-5 minutes. Once charred, flip and cook an additional 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

## Brown the Curry Paste:

* Melt the butter into the pot and add the coconut paste. Lightly mash it with the back of your spoon and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the crushed red pepper and chili powder, if using, and lightly sauté until fragrant, about 45 seconds.

## Simmer the Sauce:

* Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Taste and season to your preferences. Reduce heat to medium and add the coconut milk. Allow to bubble on medium heat for 10 minutes. Do not allow the sauce to reduce too much or to boil too hard.

## Cook the Scallops:

* While the sauce simmers, pat the scallops dry and remove the side muscle. Season liberally with salt and pepper.
* Gently place the scallops in the broth in an even layer and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 4-5 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the scallops to rest for 1 minute. Remove the lid. If the scallops are opaque, serve immediately. If they need to cook a little longer, cover again and allow the residual heat from the broth to cook them. Do not overcook them!

## To Serve:

* Ladle the coconut curry broth and charred tomatoes into a shallow bowl and arrange the scallops in the broth. Garnish with fresh cracked pepper, red pepper flakes, and herbs like cilantro or parsley leaves, if desired. Serve with cooked basmati rice or naan bread, if desired. Enjoy!

Just as a note - if you’re on an electric stove, bring your heat down a few minutes before you add the scallops!!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/l5okur/spicy_coconut_curry_scallops_with_charred_tomatoes/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/l5okur/spicy_coconut_curry_scallops_with_charred_tomatoes/

Author: Kylie Perrotti

## Equipment

* Wide skillet

## Ingredients

## Spicy Thai Basil Squid:

* 2-3 tablespoons neutral cooking oil for frying, add more as needed
* 2 shallots peeled and sliced into thin wedges
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 3 Thai chili peppers trimmed and minced (use fewer chili peppers if you want it less spicy)

* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* ⅓ cup water
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Cooked white rice for serving

## Instructions

## Cook the Aromatics:

* Heat two teaspoons of oil in a wide skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the shallot and cook for 3-4 minutes until golden brown and softened.
* Add the garlic and chili peppers to the skillet and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Do not burn the garlic! Immediately transfer to a bowl.

## Cook the Mushrooms:

* Heat another teaspoon or two of oil in the skillet and add the mushrooms. Cook for 4-5 minutes until beginning to crisp up and turn golden brown. Transfer to the bowl with the aromatics and season everything with a sprinkle of salt.

## Finish the Spicy Squid:

* Add the squid and aromatics and mushrooms to the sauce and toss to combine. Turn the heat to medium-low. Tear the Thai basil leaves in half and add to the skillet.

k9a3ii,My dad's Crispy Pan Fried Salmon (香煎三文魚) + Dipping Sauce!,6016,197,1607452991.0,0.99,Seafood,madewithlau,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/k9a3ii,"Excited to share a dish I grew up with! 

The salmon is a super easy weeknight recipe that’s ready in under 25 minutes, and the sauce is something my parents always have a stash of in their fridge, since it pairs well with a ton of different dishes.

Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DKlH4K1ANA&amp;&amp;list=PLvd5bo3J-_kq4FcYVCOK6ZR87dCGDqrSH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s) for a walkthrough.

# Sourcing Salmon Sustainably

For this specific recipe, my parents bought Atlantic salmon. With regards to Atlantic vs Pacific, farmed or wild-caught, there’s no right or wrong choice, but my parents have a slight preference for Atlantic salmon, which nowadays are primarily farmed. 

As one of the world’s most consumed species of fish, salmon is a massive industry, with several million tons sold every single year, and tons of complexity surrounding how we source it in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way. 

As consumers, an easy way to do our part is by making sure we vote with our wallets. Monterey Bay Aquarium in California runs a free website and mobile app called ""Seafood Watch"" which has a ton of recommendations on how to choose and purchase seafood in ways that have the least environmental impact.

# Salmon + Chinese communities in the west

As I was researching this recipe, I felt like it was important to share how salmon and fishing helped form some of the first Chinese communities in the West.

During the Gold Rush, tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants, mostly from Guangzhou, flocked to California enticed by the promise of the Gām Sāan, or gold mountain in Cantonese, although many were forced out of mining work due to discrimination. 

Undeterred, a group of experienced fishermen found their own gold in abalone and other fish along the Monterey coast. Known as China Point by locals, Chinese immigrants proudly sparked the first large scale commercial fishing industry in California, supplying fish and shellfish to countries all over the world. 

During and after the Gold Rush and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, many Chinese immigrants relocated to Seattle, Vancouver, and surrounding areas to work for salmon canneries and on fishing boats, doing the difficult work of supplying and processing most of the world’s salmon at the time.

Today, the once thriving Chinese enclave in Monterey no longer exists, but in spite of periods of intense discrimination and oppression, Seattle and Vancouver are still homes to some of the largest Chinese communities abroad.

## THE RECIPE

Overview

* Prep Time: 10 min
* Total Time: 25 min
* Yield: 4 servings

Ingredients for Salmon

* 1.5 lb **salmon**
* 1 **egg**
* **white pepper** (to taste)
* 3 tbsp **cornstarch**
* 2 tbsp **corn oil**
* 0.50 tbsp **rice cooking wine**
* **garlic salt** (to taste)

Dipping Sauce

* 1 tbsp **sugar**
* 0.50 tbsp **vinegar**
* 2 tbsp **light soy sauce**
* 0.25 tsp **chili sauce** (to taste)
* 2 tbsp **boiling water** (very important)

Optional Garnish

* **cilantro**
* **broccoli**

# Step 1 - Cut salmon

This is totally optional, but if you're planning on garnishing the salmon with anything (like cilantro) or serving it with any vegetables (like broccoli), then it's best to cut it before the salmon (for sanitation).

To make our **salmon** (1.5 lb) fillets, make diagonal cuts about 2 cm apart. The diagonal cuts help increase the surface area of the fillets, which leads to a faster cook and less moisture loss.

# Step 2 - Coat salmon

Spread the fillets out on the cutting board, and sprinkle **white pepper** on each side. The white pepper helps counter some of the ""fishy"" taste of the salmon, which has a slightly negative connotation in Chinese cuisine.

We'll crack and mix our **egg(s)** (1) into a bowl, and spread out **cornstarch** (3 tbsp) on a plate.

Coat each side of each salmon fillet first in the egg, and then the cornstarch. Make sure each side is evenly coated.

This coating helps the salmon retain its juices, and also add some delicious crunchy/crispiness when it's cooked.

# Step 3 - Cook salmon

**Heating the wok**

We’ll set our stove to medium high and let our wok heat up.

Unlike other Chinese recipes, with salmon, it’s important that the wok gets hot enough but not too hot. It’s difficult to give an exact amount of time, since it depends a lot on your stove and cookware.

My dad relies on his own intuition that he’s developed over 50 years of cooking. For the rest of us, he waited about 2-3 minutes on this current setup.

**Cook the salmon**Then, we’ll add **corn oil** (2 tbsp), and swirl it around the wok.

The wok and the oil should be hot enough once the oil starts shimmering, or making ripples.

Once this happens, we’ll add our salmon to the wok.

My dad had just enough room for 8 fillets, so try not to overcrowd your wok and consider cooking in multiple batches if necessary.

The total cooking time for the salmon also varies depending on how hot your stove is, how thick each fillet is, and what type of pan or wok you’re using.

On my dad’s current setup, which has less heat output than a gas stove, he cooked each fillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, generally not flipping the salmon over more than once.

For a visual cue, once the salmon fillet starts to turn more white / yellow-ish, you can flip it.

You should be able to tell if the salmon is done if it easily flakes. If you wanted to get more precise, you can also insert an instant-read food thermometer into the thickest part of the salmon.

**Other tips**

As long as it’s cooked enough, the rest is just a lot of trial and error to find the texture of salmon that’s perfect for you. My dad tends to prefer salmon that’s more medium or well-done, so if you prefer something more rare, then adjust accordingly.

Kenji from the Food Lab has a great blog post and video with a bunch of helpful tips on how to pan fry salmon. Not all of these tips apply to this specific recipe, but it’s still a great resource, and I’ve linked to it in our description.

# Step 4 - Add flavors, cover wok

Add **garlic salt** to the fillets.

Then, we'll add **rice cooking wine** (0.50 tbsp). We should have the lid for the wok within reach, because we’ll be covering the wok immediately after we pour the cooking wine in. We’ll only be covering the wok for about 20 to 30 seconds before we take the lid off.

# Step 5 - Uncover, plate, garnish

Uncover the wok, and turn the heat off. Transfer the salmon fillets to a plate, and add any garnish you'd like.

# Step 6 - Create sauce

To make the sauce, mix together **sugar** (1 tbsp), **vinegar** (0.50 tbsp), **light soy sauce** (2 tbsp), **boiling water** (2 tbsp), and **chili sauce** (0.25 tsp). Mix it all together for about 5-10 seconds.Notes:

* If you prefer more spiciness, feel free to add more chili sauce.
* If you’re wondering why my dad specifically uses boiling water, it’s to help extend the shelf life of the sauce. My parents elaborate on why during our ""Meal Time"".

\-------

# Our why

I've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.

\- 400g fish filet - 200g lettuce - 150g celery - 100g bean sprouts - 2 tbsps chili bean sauce - 15g dried chili - 2g Sichuan peppercorn - 10g ginger - 20g garlic - 1 green onion

Fish Marinade:

\- 2g salt - 2 tsps Chinese cooking wine - 1/2 egg whites - 1oz starch water (2g cornstarch + 1oz water) - 1 tsp oil

Chili soup:

\- 0.6L hot water - 3g salt - 3g sugar - 2g black pepper - 1 star anise - 2oz starch water (4g cornstarch + 2oz water)

&amp;#x200B;

**Directions:**

1. Slice the fish filet and marinate it for 20 min.
2. Under medium heat, toast the Sichuan peppercorn for 6 min, toast the dried chilis for 3 min. Take out the spices and blend them into powder separately.
3. Under high heat, add 1 tbsp of oil and stir fry the veggies for 3 min, add a pinch of salt and sugar, and mix well. Put them at the bottom of the bowl.
4. Under medium heat, add two tbsps of oil, add two tbsps of chili bean sauce and stir fry for 1 min. Add the ginger slices and garlic, stir fry for 1 min, then add the chili powder and half of the peppercorn powder, stir fry for another min. Add hot water and one star anise, let it cook for 5 min.
5. When the time is up, turn down the heat to low, add the fish slices into the soup and cook for 4 min. Add salt, sugar, black pepper, and stir gently. Finally, add 2oz starch water to thicken the soup. Mix well.
6. Place the fish slices on top of the veggies, add the chili soup, garnish it with chopped garlic, green onions, the rest half of the peppercorn powder, and a few dried chilis. Pour 1oz hot oil to release the fragrance of the chili and garlic.

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

1. The egg whites can help keep the fish tender, the starch water can prevent the fish from being overcooked, a little oil can keep the fish slices from sticking together.
2. The freshly toasted and blended chili powder and peppercorn powder are much more fragrant than the store bought powder. I highly recommend doing this step for this dish!
3. I used lettuce, celery, and bean sprouts to add some crunchy texture to the dish. Feel free to use your favorite veggies.
4. When making the chili soup, make sure to not add the ingredients all at once, otherwise they will overpower one another. Adding them one by one creates multiple layers of fragrance and tastes.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/jrok1e/sichuan_boiled_fish_shui_zhu_yu_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/jrok1e/sichuan_boiled_fish_shui_zhu_yu_recipe/
jppcnx,The perfect recipe for tender and delicious fried calamari!,1140,45,1604748656.0,0.99,Seafood,sierravita,https://i.redd.it/8midub1uzsx51.jpg,"While this may seem like a simple recipe, you'd be surprised how easy it is to overcook fried calamari. Most people don't know the secret as to how to tenderize the calamari the night before cooking so that it comes out perfect and with even more flavor.

**Ingredients**

* The desired amount of calamari, cleaned and cut (I usually make about 1 kg each time, it goes quick!)
* About 10-15 lemons
* 4 cups of frying flour
* Deep frying oil
* 2 tbsp corn starch (optional)
* 1 cup of milk/buttermilk
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp Red pepper flakes (optional)
* Fresh chopped parsley

**Directions**

1. Put all of your cleaned calamari into a large bowl. Squeeze about 5-10 lemons (depending on their size) into the bowl of calamari. Cover with plastic and leave in the fridge overnight.
2. The following day, take the calamari and rinse off any excess lemon juice. Then, replace the calamari in the same bowl and pour milk/buttermilk until they are fully submerged. Cover with plastic and leave in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
3. While waiting, take a bowl and mix your flour with your seasonings. If you like a bit of a kick, use some red pepper flakes. Add corn starch for that extra crispiness.
4. Take your calamari from the fridge and *individually* dredge each piece in your flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Set them aside for frying.
5. Preheat your frying oil to 375 degrees F, either in a pot or deep fryer no more than half full.
6. Fry your calamari for no more than 2-2 1/2 minutes until golden brown. Drain excess oil using paper towels 
7. Let cool and serve with your chopped parsley and remaining lemon juice to taste.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/jppcnx/the_perfect_recipe_for_tender_and_delicious_fried/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/jppcnx/the_perfect_recipe_for_tender_and_delicious_fried/

j45ef3,Made a light dinner today. Blackened Cod with Lemon Brown Butter Sauce,1870,20,1601681557.0,0.98,Seafood,nataknowsbest,https://i.redd.it/laapwdw2orq51.jpg,"CAJUN SEASONING
- 2 teaspoons of Salt
- 1 teaspoon of  Black Pepper
- 1 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper
- 1 teaspoon of Paprika
- 1 teaspoon of Garlic Powder
- 1 teaspoon of Onion Powder
- 1 teaspoon of Red Pepper Flakes
- 1 teaspoon of Dried Oregano

LEMON BUTTER SAUCE
- 2 to 4 tablespoons of unsalted butter
- 1 lemon juiced
- 1 tablespoon of garlic paste 

INSTRUCTIONS:
Pick your desired cut of fish. I chose 6 oz of cod filets. Rinse them in white vinegar and lemon, to remove any fishy smell.

Apply your cajun/blackening seasoning (to your desired taste or level)and massage well. Set aside for 10 minutes for a quick marinade. Cajun seasoning recipe is large enough for 4-5 servings of fish. 

When ready, sear your filets on medium-high heat. Place the filet down &amp; don't move it. Allow it to build a crust (approx. for 4 minutes) then flip to other side. Splash some water into your pan and cover. The steam will finish cooking your filets, leaving them juicy and flaky. 

Remove filets and begin building your butter sauce in the same pan. Don't clean your pan before this step. Any leftover blackened bits will flavor your sauce. Deglaze your pan with butter, garlic and lemon juice. Whisk until your sauce is glossy. Season to taste and serve over your cod.

Pair your cod filets with your favorite side dish, I chose garlic mashed potatoes but creamy polenta or risotto would work too.

Enjoy!

## Cook the Farro:

* Bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a pot. Add the farro and 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to a low boil and cook for 25-30 minutes. The farro should be tender but not overcooked. Drain and set aside.

## Prepare the Broth:

* Melt the butter into the pot. Once frothy, add the water and bring to a boil. Season liberally with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Add the thyme.

## Simmer the Broth:

## Cook the Swordfish:

* After adding the tomatoes to the broth, cook the swordfish.
* Pat the swordfish dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
* Heat the oil in a skillet over high. Once very hot, add the swordfish and cook without moving for 2-4 minutes. *Note: Depending on the size of your skillet, you may need to cook the swordfish in batches. Do not overcrowd the skillet.*

Author: Kylie Perrotti

## Equipment

* Wide pot
* Medium pot

## Ingredients

## Squid:

* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 5 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2 red Fresno chili peppers trimmed and minced; or use crushed red pepper
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 4 Roma tomatoes chopped
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes left whole
* 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* ½ cup fresh basil leaves a few leaves reserved for garnish
* 1 pound squid cleaned; tentacles left whole, tubes cut into rings
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* ½ lemon juiced
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Grits:

* 1 cup yellow corn grits
* 3 cups water
* 1 cup whole milk or ½ cup heavy cream
* 3 tablespoons butter
* Salt, pepper, and paprika to taste

## Instructions

## Cook the Sauce Aromatics:

* Heat 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil in a wide pot. Add the onion and cook for 3 minutes. Add the garlic and minced chili pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

## Cook Tomatoes:

* Melt the butter into the aromatics and add the chopped and whole tomatoes. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the tomatoes begin to break down a bit. Season with salt and pepper.

## Simmer the Sauce:

* Pour in the stock and bring to a bowl. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer over a very, very low boil for 10-12 minutes until the broth is thickened and reduced. Taste and season again to your preferences, adding more crushed red pepper if a spicier sauce is wanted.
* After the sauce has simmered, tear the basil leaves in half and stir into the sauce.

## Prepare the Grits:

* While the sauce is simmering, cook the grits. Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot. Stir in the grits and whisk constantly until they begin to thicken, about 5-10 minutes, reducing heat as necessary to keep the grits from bubbling over too much.
* Whisk in the butter and milk or cream and reduce heat to low, simmering for 10 minutes and whisking occasionally. Season with salt, pepper, and paprika to taste. Keep warm.

## Cook the Squid:

* As the grits finish simmering, cook the squid. Turn to the broiler on high. Pat the squid dry and arrange in an oven layer on top of the tomatoes. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of salt.
* Transfer to the pot to the broiler for 7-9 minutes, checking the squid occasionally, until the squid is opaque and cooked through. Don't overcook the squid.

## Finish the Squid:

* Transfer the pot back to the stove and add the lemon juice.

## To Serve:

* Divide the grits between shallow bowls and pile the squid and tomato sauce on top. Garnish with lemon slices (if desired) and reserved fresh basil leaves. Enjoy!

ia5nju,Seafood Spring Rolls with Soy &amp; Chilli Sauce,2247,27,1597490585.0,0.98,Seafood,mienczaczek,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/ia5nju," There is nothing better than crunchy pastry filled with sweet seafood and vegetables, dipped in a sauce that explodes with flavours on your tongue. Easy to prepare can also be baked as a healthier option for anybody who watches calories after a lockdown. Delicious lunch, snack or party food, this are made to the proper size that fits in hand.

On this occasion for the first batch, I used Crab meat from Devon and a few Scollops that I purchased on the seaside market. for the second batch, I used Surimi from my local supermarket. Both variations were super tasty!

**Ingredients for 16 spring rolls** (5 inches long) **:**

* 16 sheets of 10-inch (25cm) spring roll pastry (you can use a smaller size if you prefer)
* 400g (14oz) of Seafood (Surimi, chopped prawns, picked crab meat, crayfish tails, chopped seared scallops)
* 120g (4.2oz) of bamboo shoots cut julienne
* 100g (3.5oz) of Nappa cabbage, shredded 
* 100g (3.5oz) of bean shoots 
* 100g (3.5oz) of onions, sliced
* 50g (1.8oz) of carrot cut julienne
* 50g (1.8oz)of celery thinly sliced
* 10g (half a bunch) of coriander chopped
* 2tbsp of sesame oil
* Oil for deep frying

**Ingredients for the sauce:**

* 50g (1.8oz) of sweet soy sauce (or 25g if using dark soy sauce)
* 25g (0.9oz) of sweet chilli sauce
* 1tsp of lime juice
* 5g (1tsp) of grated ginger
* 1tsp of sesame oil
* 1tsp of mirin

**Method:**

**1.** In a small pan, heat 2tbsp of sesame oil and sweat the onions on medium heat until soft then transfer to a bowl and mix with chopped bamboo shoots, cabbage, bean shoots, carrots, celery, coriander and seafood.

**2.** Wrap in the pastry as shown on the photos, use water with a little bit of flour to seal and place on a tray ready for later (make sure you pack the filling tightly without air pockets). If possible you can chill spring rolls before deep frying for the extra crispy result.

**3.** Next, heat the oil for deep frying to 180C (356F) and fry until golden brown, alternatively brush with a little oil and bake in the 200C (392F) oven for around 20-30 minutes.

**4.** For the dressing mix all the ingredients together and serve &amp; enjoy!

**Insight:**

* Most of the ocean creatures balance the saltiness of seawater by filling their cells with amino acids, one of them, glycine is sweet the other one glutamic acid is savoury and mouth-filling. Shellfish are especially rich in these and other tasty amino acids!

hlxjz5,Grilled chipotle shrimp skewers with corn salad,7,1,1593995326.0,0.72,Seafood,darkeblue,https://i.redd.it/6xr1151vs4951.png,"Recipe - Originally Taken from Here: [Chipotle shrimp skewers with corn &amp; avocado salad recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH89XepLYik)

Grilled shrimp, grilled corn, tomatoes, avocado - this meal screams summer and is simple enough to make on a weeknight!  Scroll down for recipe.

&amp;nbsp;

## **Ingredients-**


## For the salad:

* 2 ears corn, husked
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 clove garlic
* ½ pint small tomatoes (grape or cherry), sliced in half
* 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
* 1/3 cup red onion, sliced thinly
* 1 tablespoon lime juice
* 1 avocado
* Kosher salt

## For the shrimp:

* ½ lb. jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined 
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon lime juice
* ½ teaspoon lime zest
* 1 tablespoon minced chipotles in adobo (about 2 chiles)
* 1 teaspoon honey

## Also needed:

* 4 skewers

&amp;nbsp;


**Instructions:**

&amp;nbsp;

In a medium baking dish, dissolve 2 tablespoons kosher salt into 4 cups cold water.  Add the corn and let soak for 30 minutes.  (If using bamboo skewers for the shrimp, throw them in as well.)

&amp;nbsp;

Meanwhile, place a tablespoon of olive oil in a small saucepan, and grate a clove of garlic into the olive oil using fine tooth grater.  (You can also use a garlic press or mince the garlic).  Warm the oil and garlic over medium low heat until the garlic begins to sizzle and becomes fragrant; this shouldn’t take more than 30 seconds.  Remove the saucepan from the heat and set aside to cool. (You’ll be adding this to the salad later.) 

&amp;nbsp;

Marinate the shrimp. Place all of the ingredients for the shrimp, with the exception of the honey, in a medium size bowl and allow to marinate for 10-15 minutes.  Divide the shrimp evenly between 4 skewers, then chill in the fridge until ready to cook.  Transfer the marinade to a small blender, food processor, or a mortar and pestle.  Add the honey and process/crush to form a paste.  Chill in the fridge until it’s time to grill the shrimp.

&amp;nbsp;

If using a charcoal grill, open the bottom vent completely.  Light a large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes.  When the top coals are partially covered with ash, pour them evenly over grill.  Set the cooking grate in place, over, and open lid vent completely.  Heat until hot, about 5 minutes.   If using a gas grill, heat the grill high.  Cover, and heat until hot, about 10 minutes.
Clean and oil the cooking grate.  

&amp;nbsp;

Grill the corn, turning every 3 to 4 minutes until the kernels are lightly charred all over, about 10-15 minutes.  Remove the corn from the grill and allow to cool on a cutting board until it’s safe to handle without burning yourself; about 5 minutes.  

&amp;nbsp;

Slice the corn off the cob and transfer to a medium size bowl.  Add the sliced tomatoes, cilantro, onion, garlic and olive oil mixture, lime juice, and ¼ teaspoon of kosher salt.  Stir to combine.  Dice the avocado and gently fold it into the salad.  Set aside until ready to serve.

&amp;nbsp;

Brush one side of the shrimp skewers with the marinade &amp; honey paste.  Place on the grill, coated side down and brush the remaining marinade and honey paste on the shrimp.  Cook until pink on the outside and opaque in the center, about 3-4 minutes total, turning once half-way through cooking.  Serve hot, alongside the corn salad.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/hlxjz5/grilled_chipotle_shrimp_skewers_with_corn_salad/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/hlxjz5/grilled_chipotle_shrimp_skewers_with_corn_salad/

Now that it's summertime, I figured it's the perfect time to try making it since it's a perfect appetizer or light meal for hot weather!

INGREDIENTS

* 1 pound shrimp (about 30 large shrimp; peeled and deveined)
* 1/2 onion
* 1 bell pepper (my personal favorite is orange, but any kind works)
* 1 jalapeno
* 2 tomatoes
* 3 limes
* 2 lemons
* 1/4 cup cilantro (chopped)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 avocado
* Tortilla chips (optional for serving)

**Equipment**

* Pot
* Large bowl

DIRECTIONS

* If using frozen shrimp, defrost by running under cold water in a colander, tossing frequently to allow the shrimp to evenly defrost
* Cut the shrimp into small pieces, about 3 pieces per shrimp
* Bring a pot of water to a boil, then turn off the heat. Add the shrimp and let sit for 30 seconds, then quickly scoop them out using a slotted spoon
* While waiting for the shrimp to cool down, dice the onion, bell pepper, jalapeno, and tomatoes. Make sure to seed the bell pepper, jalapeno, and tomatoes (see my tips for how to do that in the blog post above)
* After the shrimp has cooled down to room temperature, squeeze the lemon and lime juice into the bowl. Add the chopped vegetables, cilantro, and salt and mix well. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for 1-4 hours
* When ready to eat, add sliced avocado, gently mix again, and serve with tortilla chips!

## Ingredients 

* 500g smoked barramundi
* 6 baby potatoes 
* 1 onion diced
* 2 garlic cloves crushed
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 50g salted butter
* 1/2 cup white all purpose flour
* 2 cups full fat milk
* 1/2 cup thick cream
* 1/2 tablespoon horseradish cream
* 1/2 tablespoon fish sauce
* 1/2 cup grated parmesan 
* 1 bunch dill
* 1 bunch parsley
* 100g baby spinach
* 1 lemon zest + juice
* Salt and pepper to taste 

## Method 

* Preheat the oven to 200 degrees celsius 
* Bring a medium sized pot to the boil and boil your potatoes for 15 minutes. Drain your potatoes, cut them into quarters and set to the side. 
* In a large deep dish fry pan on a low heat, fry the onion for 3 minutes then add the garlic and fry for a further 2 minutes stirring occasionally so the garlic does not burn. Place the onion and garlic in a seperate bowl and set to the side. 
* In the same pan on the same heat, add the butter and stir around until it’s all melted. Add the flour and using a whisk, whisk the flour through the butter until a smooth roux forms. Add one cup of milk at a time to the roux and whisk well until a smooth paste forms that is lump free. Repeat this step then add the cream, horseradish and fish sauce and leave to simmer for 5 minutes or until the sauce reaches a consistency you are happy with. Add more milk if you like. 
* Take the sauce off the heat and gently stir through the dill, spinach, parsley, lemon zest, cheese and fish. Squeeze over half the lemon juice and pour the sauce into an oven proof baking dish.
* In a small pot on a high heat, toast your panko breadcrumbs with a generous amount of salt and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. It will take roughly 5 minutes for your breadcrumbs to toast but keep an eye on them as they can burn very quickly as they start to brown. You want them to be a lovely golden brown colour.
* Sprinkle the panko breadcrumbs all over the sauce and pop into the oven for 20 minutes. 
* Leave the pie to sit for 10 minutes before serving and squeeze the remainder of the lemon juice over the individual serves. Enjoy with a simple green salad.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/gis42o/creamy_smoked_fish_pie_with_crunchy_breadcrumbs/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/gis42o/creamy_smoked_fish_pie_with_crunchy_breadcrumbs/

* Season your fish with salt on the skin and in the belly and place three slits into the fillet ensuring you do not hit the bone (but don’t worry to much if you do!)
* Rub your green anchovy butter into the slits of the fish, over the skin and all inside its belly. Those lovely chunky garlic bits in the sauce are going to be delicious when cooked. Place the lemon slices into the belly of the fish. 
* Place your fish into a baking tray lined with baking paper. Drizzle the fish with olive oil and bake for 20 minutes until the flesh is white and not glassy.

## Ingredients

### Stock

* 1kg prawn heads
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 celery stalks roughly chopped
* 1 carrot roughly chopped
* 2 onions with skin on quartered
* 4 bay leaves
* 8 cups water
* Salt

### Risotto

* 1kg prawns peeled and de-veined
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 white onion diced
* 4 garlic cloves crushed
* 1/2 cup white wine
* 1 cup white arborio rice 
* 6 cups prawn stock
* 2 heaped tablespoon butter
* 1/2 cup grated parmeson 
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 lemon 
* Fennel fronds to serve (optonal)

## Method

### Stock

* In a large pot on a high heat, fry the prawn heads with the olive oil for five minutes or until they turn a strong red colour. Smash the prawn heads to release all their flavour and juices with a potato masher or the back of your wooden spoon. You want to use every last drop of their gorgeous flavour that lives in their heads! 
* Throw the remainder of the ingredients into the pot and bring to the boil with the lid on. Once boiling, turn the heat down and leave to simmer for 1 hour. 
* Drain your stock through a mesh colander. In a clean pot, throw your stock in and leave on a low simmer with the lid on so it is piping hot when you are ready to cook your risotto. 

### Risotto

* In a large pot on a low heat, fry your onion for five minutes until it’s translucent and fragrant.  Stir your onion occasionally to avoid them from burning and sticking to the pan. Add in your garlic and cook for a further 2 minutes stirring quite frequently to avoid your garlic from burning. 
* Add your rice to the pot and cook for 2 minutes or until the rice turns opaque, stirring occasionally. Add in your wine and keep stirring with the rice until all of the wine is absorbed by the rice. 
* One ladle or cup at a time, add in your prawn stock and stir through quite occasionally until all the stock is absorbed. Repeat this step 5 more times until you have used up all of your stock. Your rice will start to become plump and fat as it continues to cook and absorb the stock. It should take roughly 25 minutes to cook.
* Add your prawns, butter and cheese to the pot with the rice and stir through. Cook for 3 minutes or until the prawns flesh turns pink and white. Be careful not to overcook your prawns!
* Take your risotto off the heat, squeeze some lemon and sprinkle some fennel fronds all over.

Ingredients for 2 servings

2 tablespoons  butter

2 cloves garlic, chopped

½ medium onion, chopped

5 oz  fresh spinach

1 teaspoon  salt, for spinach

1 teaspoon  pepper, for spinach

⅓ cup  breadcrumb

4 oz  cream cheese

¼ cup  shredded parmesan cheese

2 tablespoons  fresh dill, chopped

1 sheet puff pastry, softened to room temperature

1 salmon fillet

1 teaspoon  salt, for salmon

1 teaspoon  pepper, for salmon

1 egg, beaten

——

Preparation

Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).

In a pan over medium heat, melt butter. Add the garlic and onions, cooking until translucent.

Add the spinach, salt, and pepper, cooking until spinach is wilted.

Add the breadcrumbs, cream cheese, parmesan, and dill, stirring until mixture is evenly combined. Remove from heat and set aside.

On a cutting board, smooth out the sheet of puff pastry. Place the salmon in the middle of the pastry and season both sides with salt and pepper.

Place several spoonfuls of the spinach mixture on top of the salmon, smoothing it out so that it does not spill over the sides.

Fold the edges of the puff pastry over the salmon and spinach, starting with the longer sides and then the shorter ends. Trim any excess pastry from the ends, then fold the ends on top. Flip the puff pastry-wrapped salmon over and transfer for a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

Brush the beaten egg on the top and sides of the pastry. Score the top of the pastry with a knife, cutting shallow diagonal lines to create a crosshatch pattern.
Brush the top again with the egg wash.

Bake for 20-25 minutes, until pastry is golden brown.

Slice, then serve!

Ingredients

1kg prawns peeled and de-veined 

6 eggs + 2 extra for frying

2 cups Basmati rice

200g sliced bacon

2 cups peas and corn

2 tablespoons light soy sauce

1 teaspoon onion salt 

1 teaspoon roasted chilli sauce 

1/4 cup ginger juice or thumb size piece of thinly grated ginger

1/4 teaspoon white pepper 

2 teaspoons sesame oil

Spring onions sliced 

Sesame seeds 

Olive oil

Method

In a large wok on a high heat with a tablespoon of olive oil, fry your prawns for 3 minutes on each side until pink and the flesh has turned white. Cook your prawns in two batches so you do not overcrowd the pan. Set the prawns to the side. 

In the same wok on a medium heat, cook your scrambled eggs for several minutes and set to the side. 

In a large pot with 3 cups of water, cook your rice. Bring your rice to the boil then turn the heat down, cover the pot and leave to simmer for 12 minutes. All the water should be absorbed when your rice is cooked. Set your rice to the side. 

In the same wok on a high heat, fry your bacon with a generous amount of olive oil and 2 teaspoons sesame oil until browned and crispy. Add your cooked rice, soy sauce, ginger, white pepper, onion powder, roasted chilli, white pepper, prawns, eggs and peas and corn to the wok with the bacon and stir through on a low heat for several minutes until everything is mixed through. Taste your rice and add more sauce if needed. 

In a small pan on a high heat with a generous amount of oil, fry your eggs sunny side up. Wait until your oil is at its smoking point, you will see smoke coming from the pan, before adding your eggs. 

Sprinkle the spring onions and sesame seeds over the rice and place your eggs on top. Serve immediately.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fzt4em/prawn_fried_rice_with_crispy_eggs/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fzt4em/prawn_fried_rice_with_crispy_eggs/

Peel the shrimp and place them in a pot along with the shells and heads.
Add the water, saffron and bouillon cube.
Place pot over low heat and boil for 5-10 minutes.
Drain, set aside and keep warm.

For the risotto
Place a pot over high heat.
Cut the onions into 1 cm slices, drizzle with 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil and transfer to pot.
Thinly slice the garlic and add to pot.
Add the thyme, suger and sauté for 1-2 minutes until they caramelize nicely.
Add the rice and sauté until golden.
Add the wine and wait for 2-3 minutes until the alcohol evaporates.
Add the stock in batches, while stirring continuously.
Allow each addition to become completely absorbed before adding the next.
Repeat the same process for 15-18 minutes until all of the stock is done and the rice is al dente.
Remove from heat and add the butter and cream cheese. Mix until the butter has melted and is completely incorporated.
Add the parmesan, lemon juice and pepper.

**Ingredients:**

**For the Egg Muffin (4 Portions)**

* 5 Eggs
* 1/4 red pepper
* 15g Leek
* a pinch of salt
* a pinch of pepper
* 4 slices of Mozzarella 

**For the orange salmon (4 Portions)**

* 4 salmon filets (500g)
* 2 oranges
* a pinch of orange pepper
* a pinch of salt
* a pinch of pepper
* a pinch of nutmeg
* 10 g of chive

**Instructions:**

Preheat the oven to 200 °C

**Egg muffin**

1. Whisk the eggs in a medium bowl with the salt and pepper. Cut the red pepper in little and thin cubes. Quarter the leek and cut it in thin slices. Add the vegetables to the eggs and whisk it very well.
2. Oil your Muffinmould very well or it will horribly stick to it. Fill the mould with the mix and put it in the oven. Leave it in there for 15 min, of course, if you notice, that it is still uncooked then leave it for a couple of minutes more. 
3. Take them out of the oven and take them out of the form. Turn them over and place a piece of mozzarella on top and put them a little in the oven so the mozzarella melts.

**Orange Salmon**

1. Cut the two oranges open and squeeze the orange juice into a medium bowl (use oranges and not orange juice, since the orange juice is too sweet). 
2. Add all the spices listed in the ingredients. I tend to not measure them properly so I would just add a pinch and then taste the mix and add more till you are satisfied with it. 
3. Chop the chive in very little pieces and add it to the mix. 
4. Pour the juice into a casserole dish and place the filets into it. Leave it for an hour and turn the filets after 30 min so everything gets properly soaked. 
5. After the hour, put the salmon with the juice-filled casserole dish into the preheated oven and leave it for 20 min. If possible turn the filets after 10 min, so everything gets properly cooked in the juice.

Now everything is ready to eat! I really hope you enjoy it as my family did!

# [recipe for the enoki](https://thewoksoflife.com/enoki-mushrooms-garlic-scallion-sauce/)

Ingredients

* 14 ounces enoki mushrooms (400g)
* 2 tablespoons oil
* 2 cloves garlic (minced)
* 3 tablespoons light soy sauce
* ½ teaspoon sugar
* 1 scallion (finely chopped)

Instructions

1. Be gentle when handling these enoki mushrooms. Trim away about 1-inch of the root section. Use your fingers to tear the enoki mushrooms into small bite size bundles and line them up neatly. Rinse clean and drain.
1. Prepare a wok with boiling water, and blanch the enoki mushrooms in two batches, cooking each batch for about 1 minute. Drain off the water and transfer the mushrooms to your serving plate.
1. In a small saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, and cook for about 10 seconds (no need to brown the garlic). Now add the light soy sauce, sugar, and scallions. Bring the sauce to a boil, and turn off the heat. Don’t overcook the garlic and scallions--we want that fresh and sweet taste! Slowly pour the sauce over the enoki mushrooms, and serve.

1. In a saucepan, cook spinach (one large handful per person) in a bit of water until wilted. Press some of the water out against the side of the pan, and plate.
1. Add fresh or frozen haddock fillets (one per person) to the same pot and just cover with water (milk works too). Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer uncovered for 5 – 10 minutes, or until cooked. Take out and lay over the spinach.
1. Drop eggs into the water. (Again, one per person.) You can poach them, but it's easier just to drop into the water and allow to simmer until it's cooked to your liking.

1 flounder (about 750 g)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 kg oil, for frying
For the Sauce Rémoulade
150 mL vegetable oil
1 egg yolk
10 g mustard
5 g fresh chervil, chopped
5 g fresh tarragon, chopped
5 g flat-leaf parsley, chopped
10 g cornichons, chopped
5 g anchovy paste
10 g capers
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
10 mL vinegar
For the Sauce aux Poivrons Rouges
300 g sweet red bell peppers
20 mL extra virgin olive oil
1 garlic clove
125 mL heavy cream
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
For the Anglaise Coating
2 whole eggs
Salt, to taste
160 g flour
250 g bread crumbs
30 mL oil
For the Garnish
Curly parsley sprigs, as needed
Lemon wedges, as needed

Procedure:

For the Fish
Scale and fillet the fish.
Cut the flounder fillets on the bias to make them about 5 cm × 1 cm (2 in × ½ in). Cover and keep refrigerated until ready to use.
For the Sauce Rémoulade
Prepare a mayonnaise with the oil, egg, and mustard. Add the remaining ingredients. Taste to make certain that the balance of herbs, seasoning, and other flavorings is correct.

For the Sauce aux Poivrons Rouges
Slice the bell peppers in half lengthwise and remove the seeds and cores. Slice into strips. Heat the olive oil in a medium sauté pan, add the pepper and sweat. Crush and peel the garlic clove and add it to the sweating peppers. Add a few tablespoons of water. Cover the peppers with a parchment paper lid to prevent browning.
Reduce the heavy cream by half in a small saucepan.
When the peppers are soft, usually after about 20 minutes, purée them in a blender with a bit of water.
Place in a saucepan and reduce. Add the warm cream in small additions until the proper balance and consistency has been achieved. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

For the Anglaise Coating and Service
Bread the fish à l’anglaise: beat the eggs and salt together. Season the goujonettes, roll them in the flour, shake off the excess, pass through the egg mixture, and roll in the bread crumbs.
The goujonettes can be rolled in one’s hands or on a work surface. Hands should be cupped in order to produce slightly pointed and tapered ends, approximating the form of a goujon. Goujonettes can be prepared ahead of time and stored in a single layer on a sheet pan covered with parchment paper in the refrigerator.

Heat the oil to 355°F-365°F (180°C-185°C).
Place the goujonettes into the hot oil. Drain the cooked strips on paper towels.
The parsley must be completely dry before frying. To fry, place it into the hot oil and fry for 10 to 15 seconds. Do not fry too much at once.
Sprinkle the fish and fried parsley with salt.
Present the fried goujonettes in a potato basket garnished with the fried parsley. The sauces can be served to the side on the plate; sauce rémoulade can be served in a ramekin, a radicchio leaf, a hollowed cucumber cup, or a halved tomato. The sauce aux poivrons rouges can be served directly on the hot plate.

Alternative Frying Techniques
While coating fish with bread crumbs is an effective method for frying, there are other techniques that can be used as well. Basic shallow frying with a simple seasoning of salt and pepper, shallow frying the fish in a coating of flour, or deep frying with a batter-coated fish are all acceptable methods.

To fry a fillet of fish, its skin should be seasoned with salt and pepper, then placed skinside down in a shallow pan with hot oil. When the skin is crisp, the fillet can be turned over.
For extra crispiness, a fillet can be dusted with a starchy flour before it is cooked in a pan of hot oil. The flour provides a thin, but protective layer for the fish, keeping it moist and tender.
Even more so than with shallow frying, deep frying a fillet of fish after it has been dipped in a flour-based batter creates a crunchy crust, as well as protects the protein from the hot oil.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/eph8ad/fried_flounder_with_red_pepper_coulis_and/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/eph8ad/fried_flounder_with_red_pepper_coulis_and/

An easy and fast way to cook scallops without worrying about overcooking them.

 

### Ingredients

* 4-6 scallops
* Cooking spray
* Kosher salt to taste
* Cajun seasoning

### Instructions

1. Preheat your air fryer to 400 F.
2. Take your fresh sea scallops out of the fridge and quickly rinse them in cold water. Remove the side muscle with your fingers and pat dry with paper towels.
3. Once your air fryer is preheated, line the basket with aluminium foil and lightly spray with cooking spray.
4. Lightly spray the scallops with cooking oil and season with kosher salt and coat with cajun seasoning all over.
5. Place all the scallops in the air fryer and cook for 3 minutes. Flip and cook for 3 more minutes until they are opaque and register at least 130 F internally.

### Notes

* Be sure to only buy dry packed fresh sea scallops for this recipe.
* 4-6 scallops is perfect for one person for one meal. Scale up as necessary.
* Scallops are done when they reach an internal temperature of 130 F and are opaque.
* Because these are not cooked in a pan, the scallops will not turn brown but can still be done cooking.

Ingredients-MaC

6 artichokes. This is equivalent to 24 heart quarters 

2 cups broccoli

2 cloves garlic

American Cheese (6 slices minimum, more if needed)

Cheddar (1/2 cup)

1/4 cup milk

1/2 cup white wine

Spices-Basil, Oregano, Thyme, Sage, Rosemary

Ingredients-Salmon

I portion sized salmon piece

1 lemon wedge

1 tbsp olive oil

Herbs used were the same as above, plus garlic and onion powder

Recipe-MaC

Boil pasta to desired cook. I like al dente. 2 min before it’s ready throw in the artichoke and broccoli pieces

Separately add oil to pan and sauté garlic cloves. 

Add spinach and reduce water content 

Add artichokes and broccoli and get a good sauté on them

Add wine. Reduce

Add milk and spices

Add pasta and mix, slowly incorporating cheese until it’s all melted. I like my Mac and cheese sticky, and this is how you do that without making a cheese sauce. American cheese gives it stickiness, cheddar gives it sharpness, havarti makes it melts and stringy

In addition you can add any other cheese you like

1. Carnaroli rice 400g

2. Mussels 1 kg

3. Clams 500 g

4. Already cleaned squid 350 g

5. Shrimps (tails) 300 g

6. Parsley 1 tuft

7. Garlic 2 cloves

8. White wine 90 g

9. Vegetable broth without salt 500ml (or half water with salt)

10. Extra virgin olive oil

11. Cold butter 70 g

12. Fresh shallots 50 g

13. Celery 25 g

14. Carrots 25 g

15. Chili pepper 1 or 2

16. Salt and pepper to taste

**Directions**

1. To prepare risotto with seafood started with the cleaning of all shellfish and shellfish. Remember to discard mussels and clams if they are already open or broken. Then start with the mussels : remove the barnacles with a paring knife and then tear off the fine linen 

2. Finally, scrape the impurities with a steel wool and rinse well 

3. After leaving the clams to soak in water  with salt  for a couple of hours, take the time to purge the sand, drain and rinse them. Then remember to beat each clam on the cutting board or on the sink bowl to make sure they are all whole and not full of sand 

4. Empty the inside of the squid and peel off the skin. Then cut into strips about 1 cm  thick and from these cut into large pieces 2 cm 

5. Finally clean the prawn tails by removing the legs, removing the shell and the black wire placed on the back, it will be enough to cut the surface and detach it with the blade or a toothpick 

6. Now that you have everything ready, move to the stove. Start by cooking the mussels, put a large saucepan on the stove and turn on at maximum power and pour in the mussels. Close with the lid and open them by shaking the pot from time to time. It will take 2-3 minutes to open up 

7. Strain the liquid by pouring it into a fine colander placed in a container. You will need this later. 


8. Wait a few moments before you start removing the flesh from the shell, so you won't get burned. Set aside 2-3 whole mussels for each dish, you will need them for the final decoration . 

9. Switch to clam cooking. Put the pot back on the stove, turn on the stove and pour it inside. Close with the lid and let them open by shaking the pot from time to time. The bivalves will hatch in 1-2 minutes, as soon as they are opened filter the liquid by pouring it into the same container used to collect that of the mussels. 

10. Let it cool down a few moments before shelling these too, still holding 2-3 whole pieces per dish 

11. Heat the vegetable stock (and water) and clean the celery, carrot and shallot. Chop them finely with a knife; clean the garlic cloves leaving them whole. Finally, also clean the chilli and then chop it, and chop the parsley. Put everything aside and move back to the stove. 

12. Put a saucepan on the heat, pour a little oil inside and pour the chopped garlic and chopped chilli. After a minute add the celery and carrots. Cook for about ten minutes on a low flame, stirring occasionally. 

13. Once the odors are wilted, remove the garlic and raise to the maximum temperature and add the squid. Blow them up for 1 minute before adding the prawn tails 

14. Blanch for another minute and, as soon as the liquid dries, sprinkle with 40 g of white wine . When the alcohol has completely evaporated, turn off and transfer the squid and shrimp to a bowl, cover with the lid and leave to warm

15.  In the same pan pour the rice and let it roast for about 1 minute at maximum power stirring continuously, thus avoiding that the burning grains. 
16. When they are toasted blend with the remaining part of white wine (or 50 g) and wait for the alcohol to evaporate before cooking the rice with the broth (and water)  You can wet it a little at a time with ladles until you finish cooking. Add the liquid of mussels and clams and stir occasionally, but not too much. 
17. When 1-2 minutes have elapsed from the end of cooking add shrimp and squid , mussels and clams and mix. Turn off and stir in the cold butter cut into cubes ,chopped parsley and ground black pepper . Stir and let rest for a few minutes before serving. Here is your risotto with seafood ready, garnish the dishes with mussels and clams kept aside

Put the pan of fish+brine in the fridge for 24 hours. 

After 24 hours pull the pan out and arrange the fish onto the racks for the smoker and use a box fan, or any other type of fan to blow air across the fish. This creates the pellicle. Usually I run the fan for about 30 minutes and then smoke with alder wood. I do one round of smoking chips in the morning when I leave for work, then another round when I come home for lunch. It's done by the time I get home at the end of the day so total smoking time around 8 hours.

4 small whole sea bass (each about 600g), gutted and cleaned

1 head of garlic, peeled and cut into quarters

8 large sprigs of rosemary

Olive oil, for drizzling

Sea salt

METHOD

Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.

With a sharp knife, make two deep slashes in one side of each fish. Season the inside of the fish and stuff each cavity with a quarter of garlic and two sprigs of rosemary.

Take a roasting dish that’s large enough to hold the fish in a single layer (you don’t want to overcrowd the fish as it will steam rather than roast – use two roasting dishes if you need to). Rub the dish with oil then sprinkle it with salt. Place the fish in the roasting tray with the cut sides facing up. Rub that side of each fish with oil and season with salt.

Place in the oven and roast for about 20-25 minutes. Keep an eye on the flesh visible in the cuts you made – you will see that it turns opaque as it cooks. When there is about half a centimetre left to cook, take the fish out of the oven and allow the residual heat to finish the cooking. This will take 5-10 minutes. The fish won’t go cold, but you could loosely place a piece of foil over the dish if you like.

 Serve each fish on a plate and dress with your best olive oil, a squeeze of lemon and a pinch of salt.

It was a lot of fun and ended up being the best fried shrimp I've ever tasted! We ate them with bacon cheddar potato skins and oven-roasted corn on the cob.

**Ingredients**

* 1.5 lb fresh shrimp with shells and tails (freshness GREATLY impacts flavor)

* Salt

* Pepper

* Garlic powder

* 1 cup flour

* 4 tablespoons Cajun seasoning (see below)

* 2 eggs

* 2 cups Panko breadcrumbs

* Vegetable or canola oil for frying

* Lemon

**Cajun seasoning (blend together and store for future recipes)**

* 2 tablespoons garlic powder

* 1 tablespoons salt

* 2 tablespoon onion powder

* 1 tablespoon paprika

* 1 tablespoon black pepper, fresh ground

* 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper

* 1 tablespoon dried thyme

* 1 tablespoon Lowry’s seasoning (optional, but double the salt if not)

**Directions**

1. Remove legs and shells, and devein the shrimp. 
2. Rinse shrimp in a colander, then pat dry.
3. Toss shrimp with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.
4. Set out three bowls.
    1. In the first bowl, combine flour and 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning 
    2. In the second bowl, lightly beat the eggs
    3. In the third bowl, combine panko crumbs, 3 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, and salt and pepper to taste
5. Fill a large, deep pot with at least two inches of vegetable oil and preheat on medium-high.
6. In batches of 6-10, dip each shrimp in flour mixture, egg, and Panko mixture, then lower into hot oil using a slotted spoon. 
7. Fry shrimp until golden brown, flipping once after a minute or so. This doesn’t take long, 2-3 minutes maximum. You’ll know it’s done when the breading is golden brown and the shrimp underneath has turned pink. I cut my first two open to see if they were done and worked from there.
8. Squeeze lemon over the shrimp before eating.

* Homemade ranch and buffalo sauce

* Simple bang bang sauce (mayo, Sriracha, honey, lemon)

* Lemon garlic butter

I say to roughly dice the onions to introduce a bit of variety of flavor as they wont all cook evenly. This allows each bite to be familiar but different, making it harder to feel jaded from the flavor. some may like this, others may not

the tilapia is mainly cooked on a bed of onions. this serves 2 purposes. The first is that tilapia is very fragile, and may easily stick to the pan and fall apart. the second is to infuse the flavor of the onion just a little bit more.

the purpose of steaming is just to ensure an even cooking as the tilapia risks falling apart if you flip it on the onions

i say to apply more butter if needed in step 7 to prevent the tilapia from sticking

the lemon juice can be substituted with lime juice, lemon zest, or for ground coriander that is to be added in step 4",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ahc9px/delicious_onion_tilapia/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ahc9px/delicious_onion_tilapia/

* Oysters- 16 ea.
* Butter- 4 oz. (soft)
* Chipotle Peppers- 1 ea. (in the adobo sauce)-Minced
* Wildflower Honey- 3 Tbsp
* Bourbon- 3 Tbsp.
* Roasted Garlic- 2 tsp. (mashed to a paste)
* Lime- 1 ea. Zest and juiced
* Basil- 2 Tbsp. sliced
* Kosher Salt for platting

#### Method- Build a fire to create a large bed of hot coals

* In a bowl of a food processor combine the soft butter, minced chipotle peppers, wildflower honey, bourbon, lime juice, lime zest, and roasted garlic. Puree ingredients until mixed well. Remove the butter from the food processor into a small bowl. Set to the side.
* Gather enough hot coals to create a large bed for the oysters to roast on. Place the oysters on the coals. Roast the oysters until the pop open. Make sure the front of the shell is facing the oven opening. This will ensure a clear view of the oyster popping open. Once they are opened remove the oysters off of the coals. Place them on a flat surface and slice the oyster away from the shell. Place a dollop of bourbon butter on the oyster and top with some sliced basil.
* Create a bed of salt on your serving platter. Place the oysters on the salt bed. This will hold the oyster level so that the juicy, buttery deliciousness won’t run out.

With this ratio, it helps if your beer is very cold when mixing as the batter will be more crisp after frying.

1 Tbsp Olive oil 
1 onion
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 oz container of mushrooms (sliced)
15 oz. can diced tomatoes
1 lb. Wild Caught Shrimp (My absolute favorite is Trader Joe’s {TJ’s} Wild Caught Argentinian Red Shrimp)
Seasonings:
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon basil
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (if you like spice)
1/4 teaspoon salt (to taste)
1/4 teaspoon pepper (to taste)
2 Tbsp tomato paste
1/2 cup vegetable broth (I make my own)
1/4 cup TJ’s Parmesan, Romano, &amp; Asiago Cheese Blend (substitute just Parmesan, if that’s what you have)
3 Tbsp. light cream cheese (I like TJ’s organic light whipped cream cheese best)
2 cups frozen chopped spinach
1/2 6 oz can of black olives
6 oz whole wheat Rotini noodles
3 oz black bean noodles (I used TJ’s noodles, which you can find here, or in the store but Amazon is convenient if you don’t have a TJ’s close by)
DIRECTIONS:

First, take frozen shrimp and soak in cold water bath. Set timer for 20 minutes to ensure shrimp is properly thawed. (Skip this step if you aren’t having shrimp)
Gather all the ingredients and measure exact amounts needed into bowls/containers as pictured. This will help immensely for a more efficient meal!
Cook pasta according to packaging, I always find that boiling for 10 minutes produces optimal results. Once finished, drain and wash with cold water for al dente results. 
In a large skillet with tall sides, heat olive oil over medium heat for 2 minutes. 
Add onions and cook for ~3 minutes until translucent. Once onions are soft, add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute. 
Ensure shrimp is thawed then, add to onions &amp; garlic. Cook on both sides until shrimp coloring changes from gray, opaque looking to a solid white meat. 
Slowly, (without splashing) add diced tomatoes with juices, mushrooms, and seasonings to skillet. Stir to combine.
Add tomato paste and vegetable broth to skillet, stir until tomato paste is dissolved in the mixture. 
Throw in frozen spinach and olives to mixture. 
Stir in cream cheese and Parmesan, Romano, &amp; Asiago Cheese Blend. Stir until all cream cheese is melted and the dish has a creamy appearance.

1 lemon

1 clove garlic, chopped

Italian parsely, chopped

1 Dried Chili Pepper

Add all ingredients to a mixing bowl and stir until baby octopus is evenly coated. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and marinate for 30 minutes in the refrigerator.

Pre-heat barbecue to 350 degrees or medium heat. To ensure octopus does not fall through the grill, use a cooking rack. Add octopus to the grill and close the lid. Save the juice because we’re using that at the end! After 2 minutes, lift the lid and flip the octopus. They don’t take long to cook, so just a few minutes on each side is enough. Once the tentacles begin to char just a bit, using the extra juice to coat the octopus. Close the lid for just another minute.

8uu8df,Little Octopus in a Wine Sauce,7,2,1530287857.0,0.67,Seafood,readapponae,https://imgur.com/a/UVDSDWC,"Recipe:

Ingredients 

1 tray of 18-20 small octopus

1 cup dry, white wine

1 tablespoon butter

1/4 cup heavy cream

4 cloves minced garlic

1 jalapeno (if desired)

3 tablespoons of chopped parsley (if desired)

Bread to soak up yummy goodness

 

_____________________________________________________________

Instructions 

Fetch the tray of octopus and defrost them entirely. Place them over medium-high heat in a pan with the dry, white wine. Keep them covered and in the pan for about an hour, or until they’re softened.

Scoop them out and place them on a plate. The sauce you are left with should be a lovely wine-y liquid along with the pale pink juices from the octopus. Add the butter, melting it into the sauce.

Once the butter has softened entirely, add the heavy cream. Stir the mixture.

Add the garlic, and once you’ve stirred enough to ensure homogeny, add the octopuses back. I added a chopped pepper which was not only tasty but also added color, resulting in a crazy pretty dish.

Leave for a couple of minutes, and then you’re ready to serve! At this point add pepper and bit of cayenne. No salt is even needed for this recipe.  Add chopped parsley if desired, and make sure you soak that delicious sauce up with some bread.

If baking make sure you oil the bottom of preferably a glass baking pan so the skin gets nice and tasty. Fresh lemons are always a good addition with a tartar or aoili or for us simpletons straight mayo.

**Ingredients**

   * 6 medium red, orange, and/or yellow bell peppers
   * 6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided
   * 4 garlic cloves, smashed
   * 2 Tbsp. sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar
   * 1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
   * 1 1½-lb. skinless cod, halibut, or striped bass fillet
   * ½ small red onion, thinly sliced
   * ¼ cup coarsely chopped parsley
   * 2 Tbsp. drained capers
   * Country-style bread (for serving)

***
**Preparation**

1. Place racks in center and top-most positions of oven; heat broiler. Cut bell peppers in half lengthwise and remove stems, ribs, and seeds; discard. Place bell peppers on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 3 Tbsp. oil; season with salt and black pepper. Toss to coat, then turn cut side down and broil bell peppers on top rack, turning baking sheet front to back halfway through, until skins are blackened all over, 15–20 minutes.

2. Transfer bell peppers along with oil and juices on baking sheet to a large bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let bell peppers sit 10 minutes to steam, which will loosen their skins. Reduce oven temperature to 300°.

3. Uncover bell peppers and peel away charred skin from flesh (don’t worry about getting every last bit); discard. Tear flesh into ½"" strips and place in a shallow 3-qt. baking dish along with all the accumulated juices in the bowl. Add garlic, vinegar, and red pepper flakes and toss well to combine. Taste and season with more salt.

4. Nestle cod into bell pepper mixture, drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil, and season with salt and black pepper. Roast on center rack until flesh is opaque throughout and flakes easily when pressed, 25–30 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes.

6. Meanwhile, toss onion, parsley, capers, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl; season with salt.

7. Top fish with onion mixture and serve with bread.

- 1/2 cup panko breading
- 2 quarter inch slices eggplant
- 2 quarter inch slices sweet potato

1. Place the shrimp and vegetables and the corn starch and batter close to the stove for easier frying. To stretch the shrimp for tempura (so it comes out straight), shell and devein the shrimp, leaving the tail on. Make diagonal cuts along the belly of the shrimp on the segments and gentle fold in the opposite direction of the shrimp's curve. You will feel the membrane pop as it straightens.

2. Heat pot of oil over medium high heat, until the oil sizzles when you drop in a few pieces of panko. Do not allow the oil to smoke or it will discolor your tempura.

3. In a bowl, gently beat egg, water, and flour until combined into a thin batter.

4. Coat vegetables in thin dusting of corn starch and then dip in batter. Fry in oil until golden and drain on paper towel.

5. Coat shrimp in thin layer of corn starch, dip in batter, coat with panko breading and fry until golden. Drain on paper towel.

6. Top udon with tempura and other optional toppings. Additional tempura vegetables can be onion, shiso, string bean, potato, broccoli, etc.

7udg4y,Better Bar Food: Indian-Spiced Crispy Mussels,16,1,1517434293.0,0.92,Seafood,bob-the-cook,https://i.redd.it/o47c8ppj1hd01.jpg,"These are a sort of Indian tapas, good to pick at with some drinks. You can serve them however you like, in a big pile sprinkled with coriander and some lemon wedges, on little toasts brushed with coriander oil, or on the half shell on a bed of curry leaves.

***

**Ingredients**

   * 1 pound 2 ounces mussels
   * 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
   * 1 rounded teaspoon finely grated root ginger (peeled weight)
   * 4 large garlic cloves, finely grated
   * 3/4 teaspoon ground fennel seeds, or to taste
   * 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
   * 1 teaspoon ground cumin, or to taste
   * 1/4-1/2 teaspoon chili powder, or to taste
   * 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
   * 3 1/2-4 tablespoons rice flour (I often grind rice if I don't have any in)
   * 2 tablespoons semolina (optional)
   * 2 dried chilies
   * 12 fresh curry leaves
   * lemon wedges, to serve

***
**Directions**

**For the mussels**

1. Clean the mussels well by pulling off their rough “beards” and washing well in water; scrub them if they are muddy looking. If you find any which are open, tap them a couple of times on the sink: if they close, they are good to use; if they remain open, discard them.

2. Pour about 1/2 inch of water into a large saucepan. Salt it lightly and bring to a simmer. Add the mussels, cover and cook for 2–3 minutes or until they have opened. Take off the heat and uncover. Start taking out the mussels from the shells as soon as they are cool enough to handle and place into a bowl. Add a couple of spoons of the liquor from the pan and toss with the ginger, garlic, spices and the 1/2 teaspoon salt. Set aside for 10–20 minutes.

3. Clean out the saucepan, or heat up a non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat and add half the oil. Add the rice flour to the mussels and toss well to coat. Place the semolina on a flat plate and toss the mussels in this. When the oil is hot, fry a mussel until crisp on both sides, flipping once. Taste for seasoning and spice. If you need to add more of either, this is the best time to do it.

4. Add 1 dried chilli and half the curry leaves to the pan and follow, after 10 seconds, with half the mussels. They should not overcrowd the pan. I like to cook these over a medium-high heat, flipping once, until crisp on both sides, just a few minutes. Spoon out into an open bowl.

5. Repeat with the next batch, with the remaining dried chilli and curry leaves, and serve hot with some lemon wedges.

7d9t0y,30-ish Minute Shrimp and Mussels in a Spicy Saffron Tomato Broth with Toasted Pistachios,6,1,1510804561.0,0.88,Seafood,BushyEyes,https://i.imgur.com/VBh1B8N.jpg,"When I think of the perfect Wednesday night dinner, I immediately think easy, fast, flavorful. This dinner fits the bill perfectly. The addition of the toasted pistachio topping takes this humble seafood dish from mid-week dream to a fancy dinner party entrée. If you want to make this dinner more filling, serve with a toasted, crusty sourdough bread.

You can cut down on the cost by buying the pistachios in bulk. And, although the saffron does taste quite good in the broth, you can also omit it if you're looking for a more economical dinner option.

#GRADE

Serves: 4

Cost: $$

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: 35 minutes

#INGREDIENTS

1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined (tails left on or removed, depending on your preference)

20 mussels, scrubbed and debearded

4 garlic cloves

4 scallions, white parts only

1 Fresno chili

2 cups wine

1 cup chicken stock

28 ounces crushed tomatoes

1 large pinch of saffron

2 tablespoons lemon juice

Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste

A pinch of sugar

1 tablespoon of olive oil

Extra virgin olive oil, optional, for serving

**Toasted Pistachio Topping**

1/3 cup raw, shelled pistachios

4 scallions, green parts only

1 teaspoon lemon juice

Flaky salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste

#METHOD

Prepare Ingredients: Prepare the mussels and shrimp. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper. Chill the seafood until ready to cook. Thinly slice the four scallions and separate the white and green parts. Mince the Fresno chili. Mince the garlic. 

Start the Sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium until hot. Add the white parts of the scallions, the garlic, and the Fresno chili and cook until fragrant and softened, about 1 minute. Add the white wine and bring to a boil. Cook for 5 minutes until reduced slightly. Stir in the chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, and the saffron. Season with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper (if desired), and a pinch of sugar. Bring to a boil and then cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes to allow the flavors the meld. Taste and season accordingly. If desired, use an immersion blender to smooth out any of the ingredients in the sauce to your desired consistency.

Cook the Seafood: Once the sauce has simmered for 20 minutes, turn the heat to medium or medium high. Once a low boil is reached, add the mussels and shrimp and cook for 5 minutes, or until the shrimp are opaque and cooked through and all of the mussels have opened. Remove from heat.

Prepare the Toasted Pistachios: While the seafood is cooking, make the pistachio topping. Add the pistachios to a small skillet and turn the heat to medium high. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the pistachios are well-toasted. Transfer the pistachios to a food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped. Add the scallions and lemon juice and pulse just a few times until well incorporated. Transfer to a bowl and season with salt and pepper and toss to combine.

To Serve: Ladle a few spoonfuls of the broth into shallow bowls. Arrange a few shrimp and mussels on top and sprinkle the toasted pistachios over the dish. Serve with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil if desired.

They are a joy to have so if you pull some up, I highly recommend them raw.

*Bluefish Snapper Sashimi*

- Bluefish snapper thinly sliced

- Shiso, chopped

- Pickled ginger, chopped

- 1 Tablespoon soy sauce

- 1 Tablespoon lemon juice

- Wasabi, to taste

1. Scale and gut the bluefish, reserving the organ meat on the side. Slice the fish on a diagonal to produce thin slices and place in a shallow dish. Save the body for tempura.
2. Chop shiso and ginger and garnish the sashimi.
3. Mix soy sauce and lemon juice and pour into the shallow dish.

*Bluefish Snapper Bone and Shiso Tempura*

- 1/2 cup all purpose flour

- 1 Tablespoon cornstarch

- 1/3 cup water

- 2 ice cubes

- Bluefish snapper skeleton, meat stripped for sashimi

- Bluefish snapper organs, if using

- 4 - 5 whole shiso leaves

- Vegetable oil

*Dipping Sauce:*

- 1/2 cup dashi stock

- 2 tablespoons soy sauce

- 2 tablespoons sake or mirin

1. Heat vegetable oil on medium high heat.
2. Mix flour, water, and cornstarch until pancake batter consistency. Mix in ice cubes so the batter is very cold (makes it extra crispy.)
3. Coat bluefish snapper, organs, and shiso leaves in the batter and deep fry until golden and crispy. Fry body for longer than the organs and shiso, careful not to burn, so that most of the bones are crispy too.

6osqx7,Scallops and Striped Bass with Charred Tomatoes and Cherry Salsa,43,1,1500692547.0,0.87,Seafood,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/tulhdx0v72bz.jpg,"[Recipe originally posted here](http://triedandtrue.recipes/blog/seared-scallops-and-striped-bass-with-cherry-salsa-and-charred-tomatoes)

Living in the city has forced me to give up my grill, so the next best thing I've got is a lil grill pan so I can get grill marks and pretend I'm eating something straight off the charcoal. You can, of course, sear the scallops and fish in a regular old skillet; just be sure that your skillet is very, very hot.

This was also a night of disappointment in that I was hoping to make a lovely, creamy avocado dressing but it was SO hot on my walk home from the grocery store, that the cream curdled and I didn't realize it until I saw big curds of cream all over my nearly-finished dressing. We decided to trash it just to be safe – oh well, such is life!

Serves: 2

Cost: Approximately $9.55 per serving* (This price doesn't include dried herbs, oil, and other common pantry items.)

Skill Level: Easy

Time to Make: 30 minutes

**INGREDIENTS**

1/2 a recipe of Cherry Salsa (Recipe is below this one!)

10 large scallops

3/4 pound striped bass filets

1 large tomato

Olive oil

1 cup fresh arugula

1/2 small red onion

Salt and pepper to taste

Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling

**METHOD**

Prep Ingredients: Prepare the salsa according to the recipe and chill until ready to serve. Pat the scallops and fish dry and season with salt and pepper. Chill, uncovered, until ready to cook. Cut the tomato into four slices and set on a paper towel, season with salt, and set aside. Thinly slice the red onion and toss with the arugula. 

Cook the Fish and Scallops: Heat a slick of oil in a large grill pan or skillet over high until very hot and shimmering. Add the fish, skin side down, and cook until crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 3 minutes (depending on the thickness of the fish) until the fish is opaque and cooked through. Transfer to a plate and cover with foil.

Heat another drizzle of oil over high. Once the oil is very hot again, add the scallops one side of the skillet and the tomato slices on the other side. Cook the scallops for 1 minute and 30 seconds on one side before flipping and cooking for an additional 1 minute and 30 seconds or until they're opaque. Cook the tomatoes for 2-3 minutes per side, or until well charred. Remove the scallops from the skillet and continue cooking the tomatoes if necessary. Once charred, turn off the heat.

To Serve: Divide the arugula and onion salad between plates and drizzle with a touch of extra virgin olive oil, a sprinkle of salt and a crack of fresh pepper. Arrange two charred tomato slices on top of each salad and top with the scallops and fish. Serve with cherry salsa. Enjoy!

Therefore, this recipe will also work with salmon and arctic char. Very easy and versatile!

***

**Ingredients**

   * 1.5 pounds trout (or salmon, or arctic char) - 2 large fish fillets with skin on the bottom
   * 2 tablespoons olive oil (more, if needed)
   * 1 tablespoon Italian herb seasoning (dried thyme, oregano, parsley, combined)
   * salt, to taste
   * 4 garlic cloves, diced
   * 3 tablespoons lemon juice, freshly squeezed
   * 2 more tablespoons white wine
   * 2 tablespoons butter, softened
   * 2 tablespoons parsley, chopped

**Instructions**

1. Season the top of fish fillets with Italian herb seasoning and salt (generously). Fish fillets     
will have skins on the bottom - no need to season the skins.
    
2. In a large skillet (large enough to fit 2 fish fillets), heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil on medium     
heat until heated but not smoking. To the hot skillet with olive oil, add fish fillets skin side up -     
flesh side down. Cook the flesh side of the fish for about 3-5 minutes on medium heat, making    
sure the oil does not smoke, until lightly browned. Flip the fillets over to the other side, skin side     
down (add more oil, if needed). Cook for another 2-4 minutes on medium heat (to prevent oil from     
burning). Remove the skillet from heat, close with the lid, and let the fish sit for 5-10 minutes,     
covered, in the skillet, until flaky and cooked through completely.
    
3. After the fish is cooked through, off heat, using spatula, carefully remove fillets to the plate,     
separating the fish from the skin. Carefully remove or scrape the fish skin off the bottom of the pan,    
 making sure to leave all the cooking oils in the pan.
    
4. Add diced garlic, lemon juice, and white wine to the same pan with oil. Cook on medium-low     
heat for about 1 minute, until garlic softens a bit. Remove from heat. Add 1 tablespoon of chopped     
parsley, and 2 tablespoons of butter, off heat, to the sauce, stirring, until the butter melts and forms     
a creamy mixture.
    
5. Add fish to the pan, spoon sauce over the fish, top the fish and sauce with the remaining     
1 tablespoon of parsley, and serve.

Heat broth in a large pot. Stir in saffron. Pat fish and shrimp dry with paper towels. 

Sprinkle with salt and let sit 10 minutes. Use a mortar and pestle to mash 

parsley, garlic, thyme and 1/8 tsp salt into a paste; stir in paprika. Add water if 

necessary to form a paste.
 
*STEP 2*

Heat 6 tbsp of oil in 15"" paella pan over medium high heat and quickly brown 

the fish 1-2 minutes. Do not fully cook. Remove to warm platter. Add remaining 

2 tbsp of oil, onion, scallions and bell pepper to paella pan and cook until the 

vegetables are slightly softened. Raise heat, add tomato and cook until it 

becomes sauce-like, 2 to 5 minutes. Pour in the hot broth and bring to a boil. 

Sprinkle the rice evenly across the pan. Boil for 3 minutes, stirring rice and 

rotating pan occasionally. Add all reserved fish (but not shrimp). Stir in parsley 

paste. Taste for salt. Do not stir after this point. Lower the heat, continue to 

simmer until rice is no longer soupy but enough liquid remains to continue 

cooking the rice (about 10 min.). Add extra liquid if necessary.
 
*STEP 3*

Arrange shrimp, clams and mussels over rice, placing edges of mussel and 

clam shells so they open facing up. Cook, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes until 

rice is almost done. Remove pan from the heat and cover with foil. Let sit 10 

minutes. Garnish with lemon wedges and serve with fresh alioli.

15budzd,Vegetable Balti,151,6,1690542481.0,0.96,Fruit\Vegetarian,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/bmx6vs1nuoeb1.jpg,"In this recipe, I will introduce a technique commonly used in restaurants for preparing curry. To start, we will prepare a curry base gravy, which serves as the foundation for many Indian curries. This versatile and flavourful sauce will be the key ingredient in our Vegetable Balti. Additionally, you can utilize this base gravy in  other curry dishes as well.

**Portions:** 4-6 servings

**Preparation time:** 30 minutes

**Base Gravy cooking time:** 40 minutes

**Vegetable Balti cooking time:** 35 minutes

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for Curry Base Gravy:**

\* 4tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil

\* 2tbsp cumin seeds (use ground if not available)

\* 1tbsp coriander seeds (use ground if not available)

\* 1tbsp ground turmeric

\* 1/2tsp red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)

\* 1tbsp garam masala

\* 1tbsp paprika

\* 2 large onions diced

\* 1 medium carrot diced

\* 4tsp garlic ginger paste

\* 400g of chopped tomatoes

\* 700ml of vegetable stock (plus more if needed)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for Vegetable Balti:**

\* 2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil

\* 2 medium-size onions, cut into four then broken apart

\* 1 green pepper, cut into 8

\* 1 red pepper, cut into 8

\* 2 medium-size tomatoes cut into wedges

\* a handful of white cabbage cut into squares

\* 10 Okra fingers, tops removed and cut in half

\* two handfuls of frozen peas

\* 2 large potatoes, peeled and diced

\* half of small cauliflower, cut into florets

\* 1tbsp ginger garlic paste

\* 2-3 ladles of base curry gravy

\* 2tbsp of yoghurt

\* knob of butter (skip if using ghee)

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions for Curry Base Gravy:**

**1.** In a large saucepan or pot, heat the ghee or vegetable oil over medium heat.

**2.** Add the cumin seeds and coriander seeds to the hot oil. If you have ground cumin, you can add it later along with the other spices. Sauté the cumin and coriander seeds for a minute or until they start releasing their aroma.

**3.** Add the diced onions and carrots to the pan. Cook and stir them for about 5-6 minutes or until the onions become soft and translucent.

**4.** Now, add the garlic ginger paste to the pan. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously, until the raw smell of garlic and ginger disappears.

**5.** Mix in the turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and paprika (if using ground cumin, add it now). Stir everything together to coat the vegetables with the spices evenly.

**6.** Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes or until the tomatoes become soft and start breaking down.

**7.** Pour in the vegetable stock, and give the mixture a good stir. Bring it to a gentle boil.

**8.** Lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pan, and let the curry base gravy cook for about 20-25 minutes. The vegetables should become tender, and the flavours will meld together.

**9.** Once the vegetables are fully cooked, turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down slightly.

**10.** Using a blender or an immersion blender, blend the mixture until you achieve a smooth and thick curry base gravy. If the consistency is too thick for your liking, you can add more vegetable stock to reach the desired thickness.

**11.** Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt or spices if needed.

Your curry base gravy is now ready to use! You can use it immediately in your favourite curry dishes or store it for later use. This flavourful base will enhance the taste of your curries, whether you're preparing vegetarian, chicken, lamb, or any other type of curry.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Vegetable Balti:**

**1.** Heat the ghee or vegetable oil in a Balti pan or a large wok over medium heat. Add the broken apart onions to the pan and stir-fry for a few minutes until they start to soften.

**2.** Toss in the potatoes, green and red peppers, and continue stir-frying for a couple of minutes.

**3.** Add the tomato wedges to the pan and sauté briefly until they start to break down and release their juices.

**4.** Incorporate the white cabbage, okra, frozen peas and cauliflower florets into the pan. Stir everything together to mix the vegetables evenly.

**5.** Add the ginger garlic paste and continue to stir-fry for a minute or two, ensuring the vegetables are coated with the paste.

**6.** Pour in the base curry gravy. Start with 2 ladles and adjust the quantity based on how saucy you want the Balti to be.

**7.** Stir everything together and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the vegetables cook in the gravy for about 15-20 minutes or until they are fully cooked but still retain their texture.

**8.** Check the seasoning and add salt or additional spices if needed.

**9.** Stir in the yogurt and mix it well with the vegetables and gravy. This will add a creamy richness to the dish.

**10.** If you're using vegetable oil, add a knob of butter at this stage to enhance the flavours of the Vegetable Balti.

**11.** Once the vegetables are cooked to your liking and the flavours have melded together, turn off the heat. Your Vegetable Balti is now ready to be served! Transfer it to a serving dish, and you can garnish it with chopped fresh coriander leaves if desired. Enjoy this flavourful and aromatic dish with naan, rice, or any bread of your choice. Enjoy!

Pour enough water to completely cover the cheese, and soak it for 20 minutes to reduce the saltiness and change the texture of the cheese. When it's ready, remove it from the water and mix it with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, paprika, and turmeric.

**2.** For the sauce, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium-sized pot over medium heat. Add cumin, coriander, and caraway seeds and cook until fragrant, then add sliced garlic and diced onion. Cook until the onions are softened, then add paprika and harissa paste. Cook for another minute and add chopped tomatoes, honey, salt, and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. If the sauce seems too thick, add water. Cook for 10 minutes.

**3.** In the meantime, preheat the oven to 220°C fan and prepare the vegetables for roasting. Place the diced aubergine in a bowl and marinate it with balsamic vinegar, olive oil, honey, salt, and Ras el Hanout spice blend. Mix well, then add peppers and onions and mix again. The aubergine's spongy texture will soak up all the flavours. Place the vegetables on a tray and roast in the oven for around 20 minutes (Don't overcrowd the vegetables on the roasting tray. Spread them out in a single layer so that they cook evenly and roast to perfection, use two trays if necessary).

**4.** When the sauce is ready, you can blend it or leave it as is. Transfer it to a cast iron pan or other baking dish, add the roasted vegetables to the sauce, and top with the halloumi cheese. Place it in the oven and change the setting to the 220°C grill. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until the halloumi cheese starts to brown (Be careful not to overcook the Halloumi cheese. It only needs a few minutes under the grill to brown and become crispy. Keep an eye on it and remove it from the oven as soon as it reaches your desired level of doneness).

**5.** Remove from the oven, garnish with parsley or cilantro, and enjoy with your favourite flatbread! Enjoy!

 **Cauliflower curry purée:**

* 2 tablespoons neutral oil
* 2 shallots or 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced
* 1 medium head cauliflower (about 1 pound), trimmed and cut into florets
* 1½ tablespoons curry powder of choice, I used a hot Punjabi masala

**Basmati rice (optional):**

* 1 shallot or small yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 cup basmati rice
* 1¾ cups water
* ½ cup frozen peas

**For serving (optional):**

* Lime wedges, cilantro, sliced Serrano or bird’s eye chili peppers

**Sauté the vegetables:**

1. Heat 2 tablespoons neutral oil in a large, wide pot over medium heat. Add the shallot (or onion) and potatoes and cook, often stirring, for 5 minutes. Season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Add the cauliflower florets and arrange them into an even layer. Sizzle in the oil for 4–5 minutes until they begin to char around the edges. Season with salt.
3. Create a well in the middle of the pot and add another splash of oil if the pot is dry. Add the curry powder to the hot oil and let it bloom for 30–40 seconds. Toss to coat the vegetables in the powder and season again with salt if needed. Add red pepper flakes if you like extra heat.

**Simmer the vegetables:**

1. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes or until the cauliflower and potatoes are fork-tender. Stir the vegetables occasionally to ensure they haven't stuck. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.

**Prepare the basmati rice (optional):**

1. While the vegetables simmer, make the rice. First, rinse the rice thoroughly. Set aside.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 3–4 minutes.

4. Turn off the heat. Remove the lid and quickly add the frozen peas (do not stir them into the rice). Cover and let the residual heat steam the peas for 5–10 minutes. Remove the cover and stir to combine. Taste and add salt, if needed.

**Finish the purée:**

1. Pour in the coconut milk and simmer for 5 minutes. Using an immersion blender, blend until completely smooth and creamy. Add more water in ¼ cup increments until desired consistency is reached. You may need up to 1 cup of additional water if serving as soup. If serving as a purée, you may not need water at all. Taste and season.

Time: 35 mins

Serves: 4

Original Recipe: [https://www.craftycookbook.com/crispy-orange-tofu/](https://www.craftycookbook.com/crispy-orange-tofu/) 

A generous coating of corn starch helps get this tofu incredibly crispy. Make sure to press the tofu to remove excess water for best results. 

**Ingredients**

* 1 block extra firm tofu, 14 – 16 oz, pressed to remove excess water
* 10-12 oz broccoli florets, \~4 cups
* 3 green onions, greens sliced thin, or topping
* ¼ cup corn starch
* roasted sesame seeds, optional, for topping
* crushed red pepper flakes, optional, for topping
* veggie oil

*For Sauce:*

* 2 navel oranges -  zest one orange, juice both oranges, or sub ⅔ cup orange juice
* 3 tbsp honey, sub date syrup for vegan
* ¼ cup soy sauce
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* ½ tbsp ginger paste or freshly grated ginger, or sub ½ tsp ground ginger
* 2 tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar
* 2 tbsp corn starch
* sriracha sauce, optional, (for mild – ½ tbsp ; medium – 1 tbsp ; hot – 1.5+ tbsp)

**Instructions**

1. Cut the tofu into \~¾” cubes. In a large bowl, toss the cubes in the ¼ cup of corn starch until they have an even, thick coating.
2. Combine the soy sauce and 2 tbsp corn starch in a small saucepan and whisk until fully combined. Then add the rest of the sauce ingredients and mix well. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-low heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer until a thick sauce forms, about 5 minutes. Remove the completed sauce from heat. If you accidentally over-reduce the sauce, just add a splash of water and mix.
3. As the sauce cooks, warm a generous swirl of veggie oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the tofu pieces and cook, turning occasionally, until they are golden and crispy on most sides, about 10 minutes. Remove to a large bowl.
4. Add a little more oil to the pan if needed, and add the broccoli florets. Cook until they brighten in color and just begin to char, about 2 minutes.
5. Pour the orange sauce over the tofu and toss to fully combine, then add the broccoli and toss further.
6. Serve over a bed of rice (I use jasmine rice). Top with green onions and sesame seeds. Add crushed red pepper flakes for extra spice.

**Notes**

* Pressing the tofu to remove excess water is very beneficial to the final texture, I strongly recommend pressing your tofu for at least 30 minutes before preparing the recipe. If you don’t own a tofu press, wrap the block in paper towels, set it on a rimmed plate or tray, and place a heavy object on top of it.

Really simple and tasty! If interested, you can see a demonstration of it [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CnxJXBaI8h9/). Recipe below!

**Ingredients**

* Sunflower oil, for frying- 1 eggplant, cut into ½-inch pieces
* 1 bell pepper, chopped
* 1 celery stalk, finely chopped
* ½ of large carrot, finely chopped
* ¼ cup pine nuts
* 2 tablespoons brine-packed capers, drained
* 1 1/2 teaspoon sugar3 tablespoons white vinegar

**Instructions**

1. Fill a medium-sized frying pan with about a half-inch or sunflower oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is sizzling (you’ll hear a few pops), lower the heat to medium and add the eggplant for about 8 - 10 minutes or until it’s lightly browned on all sides.
2. Remove the eggplant with a slotted spoon and transfer it to a bowl. If the eggplant looks too oily, you can put paper towels in the bowl to absorb some of the oil like latkes.
3. Add the chopped bell pepper and cook for about 3 - 5 minutes. Transfer it to the bowl with a slotted spoon and add in both the celery and carrots for about two minutes. They should be crispy. Transfer to the bowl with the slotted spoon again.
4. Next, remove the oil from the skillet (pouring it into a separate container, never down the drain) and wipe it down with a paper towel. Put all of the vegetables back in over medium heat.

In this instance, I prepared a vegetarian version with roasted paneer cheese and vegetables. This sauce also works great with Chicken, Lamb and Beef. You can also use it as a dipping sauce for Naan bread or for other vegetarian alternatives like chickpeas or lentils. I hope you find this recipe useful, enjoy cooking!

This recipe makes 4 portions.

**Ingredients:**

\* 200g of paneer cheese, cut into cubes

\* 2 medium onions, small dice

\* 1 medium carrot, fine dice

\* 4 garlic cloves, sliced

\* 4tbsp of veg oil or ghee

\* 500ml of veg stock

\* 1 can of coconut milk or coconut cream

\* 2 peppers, large dice

\* 1 red onion, cut into wedges

\* fresh coriander for garnish

\* salt

**Korma Spice Blend:**

\* 1tbsp of ground cumin

\* 2tbsp of ground coriander

\* 2,5tbsp of ground turmeric

\* 1tbsp of garam masala

**Garam Masala for Korma:**

To make the most delicious curry you can prepare your own Garam Masala. The secret is to ground the spices fresh, for this purpose, you can use an inexpensive electric grinder to do so. Below you can find a list of basic ingredients that make the most aromatic Garam Masala, if you don't want to go that far with your cooking you can purchase a ready-made blend.

\* 3cm of cinnamon

\* 1 star anise

\* 1tsp of black peppercorns

\* 1/2tsp of cloves

\* 10 green cardamom pods

**Instructions:**

1. Set frying pan on medium heat, add 2tbsp of vegetable oil followed by diced onions, garlic and carrots, and cook until soft and glossy (10-15min) stirring occasionally.
2. Add good pinch of salt and 3tbsp of  Korma spice blend, incorporate and cook on low for another minute or so to bloom the spices.
3. Transfer everything from a frying pan to a medium-sized pot and add 500ml of vegetable stock. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer, place a cover on the pot and cook for around 10 minutes.
4. In the meantime roast red onions, peppers and paneer cheese. To do so marinate them in 2 tbsp of vegetable oil, a little salt and 1tbsp Korma spice blend. Roast at 220C for around 15 minutes. To save energy I recommend using an air fryer instead of the oven.
5. Now add coconut milk or cream to the pot and blend the sauce using an immersion blender. Once smooth, check the seasoning and add more salt if necessary, if you like your Korma more on the sweet side add honey instead.
6. You can combine sauce with roasted vegetables and paneer cheese or serve them as garnish. Serve with rice or naan bread, and add fresh coriander. Enjoy!

Makes: 10 spring rolls

Time: \~45 mins

Nutrition: \~100 Cal for 1 roll + 1/10 of sauce

Original recipe:  [https://craftycookbook.com/crispy-veggie-spring-rolls-with-peanut-sauce/](https://craftycookbook.com/crispy-veggie-spring-rolls-with-peanut-sauce/)

**Ingredients**

* 10 rice paper sheets, 22 cm, round
* 1 large shallot, or sub a small onion
* 2 cups coleslaw mix (shredded cabbage &amp; carrots)\*\*
* 2 cups broccoli slaw mix (julienne broccoli stems &amp; carrots)\*\*
* ½ tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 1 ½ tbsp soy sauce
* neutral oil (canola oil, veggie oil, etc)

\*\* You can use any crunchy veggies you want, some other options are lettuce, bean sprouts, and bok choy. The preshreded mixes make this recipe easier, but you can save money but shredding the veggies yourself!

*For Sauce:*

* 2 tbsp peanut butter
* 1 ½ tbsp soy sauce
* ½ tbsp toasted sesame oil
* 1 tbsp packed light brown sugar, optional
* ½ tbsp Sriracha, add more to taste as desired
* ½ tbsp lime juice
* 1 tsp freshly minced garlic
* ½ tsp grated ginger, or sub ¼ tsp powdered ginger
* ½ tbsp cornstarch

**Instructions**

1. Peel the shallot and thinly slice it across the short end, creating rings. Separate the rings with your hands.
2. Warm 1 tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the shallots and cook, stirring frequently, for two minutes. Add the garlic, coleslaw mix, and broccoli slaw mix and cook, stirring frequently, for another minute, then add the soy sauce and cook for one more minute. Remove mixture from heat and transfer to a plate or bowl to cool. (You can jump ahead and prep the sauce for step 4 as the mixture cools, but don’t start the heat)
3. Once the mixture has cooled, make each spring roll one at a time. Prepare a wide bowl of water, large enough to dip the rice paper. Briefly dip the rice paper, turning it so every part touches the water. Place the rice paper on a clean, smooth surface and fill with ¼ cup of filling. Roll the spring roll (if you're unfamiliar with this technique, see the video on the website or google how to roll a spring roll). *\[The rice paper softens more overtime. If it feels rigid, wait a minute and try again. Try to make the rolls as tight and cylindrical as possible, wide/flat rolls don’t fry as nicely.\]*
4. Once the rolls are prepped, prepare the sauce. Combine the cornstarch with ¼ cup warm water and mix until dissolved. Combine this and all the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan and place over low heat as you pan fry the spring rolls, mixing occasionally. If needed, add a splash of water to the sauce to maintain a silky consistency as it simmers.
5. Warm 2 tbsp of oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Once hot, add 5 spring rolls (make sure they don’t touch, they will stick together).

Time: 25 mins

Makes: 4 servings (pictured is 2 servings, 1/2 batch)

Original recipe: [https://craftycookbook.com/crispy-gnocchi-in-pumpkin-sauce/](https://craftycookbook.com/crispy-gnocchi-in-pumpkin-sauce/) 

**Ingredients**

* 7.5 oz pumpkin purée, half of a standard 15 oz can
* 1 lb gnocchi, from 1 standard package
* ¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for topping
* 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, optional, for topping
* ¼ cup half-and-half
* 1 cup chicken or veggie stock
* 3 tbsp salted butter
* 1 tbsp light brown sugar
* 1 tbsp cornstarch
* ½ tbsp freshly minced garlic
* ⅛ tsp ground thyme optional
* ⅛ tsp ground nutmeg
* ¼ tsp salt

**Instructions** 

1. Dissolve the cornstarch in the chicken/veggie stock. Make sure your parmesan is grated and ready to go.
2. Melt 2 tbsp of butter in a medium skillet over medium to medium-low heat. Add the gnocchi, breaking up any that are stuck together. Toss until all the pieces are lightly coated in butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the gnocchi is golden and crispy on the outside, and soft in the center, about 10 minutes. (Note, you start with gnocchi straight out of the package, don't boil them first!)
3. Meanwhile, melt 1 tbsp of butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Once melted, stir frequently until the butter browns and gives off a nutty smell, about 1 to 3 minutes depending on the temp of your stove. Once the butter is lightly browned, add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 more minute.
4. Quickly add the pumpkin to the skillet and mix to incorporate it into the butter and garlic mixture. Add the stock/cornstarch mixture and half-and-half, and bring the skillet to a simmer.
5. Allow the pumpkin mixture to cook down, stirring occasionally, until the consistency is similar to the photos, about 7 minutes. Meanwhile, add the brown sugar, ground thyme, salt, and ground nutmeg. Remove from heat and mix in the grated parm, stir until it is fully melted and incorporated.
6. Plate the pumpkin sauce directly onto the serving dish, then top with crispy gnocchi. Add a little fresh thyme and grated parm if desired, and serve immediately.

Makes: 4 servings (pictured in bowl is 2 servings)

**Ingredients:**

* 2 medium Chinese eggplants, or sub 1 normal eggplant
* 1 block extra firm tofu
* 3 green onions, greens and whites separated and sliced thin
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* \~¼ cup cornstarch
* veggie oil
* toasted sesame seeds, for topping

*For Sauce:*

* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp oyster sauce, or sub vegan oyster sauce
* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce, or sub 1 tbsp regular soy sauce + 1 tsp brown sugar
* ½ tbsp black vinegar, or sub rice vinegar
* ½ tbsp ginger paste or fresh grated ginger
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* ½ tsp MSG optional

**Instructions:**

1. Gently press the tofu with paper towels to remove excess moisture. If desired, press the tofu in a tofu press or place between paper towels under a heavy object for a few minutes to remove even more moisture. Cut the tofu into \~¾” cubes. Dust the tofu with about 2 tbsp of cornstarch and toss to fully coat.
2. Remove the tops from the Chinese eggplants then quarter them longwise (creating 4 long strips per eggplant). Cut the strips into ½ inch pieces to create many small chunks. Dust the eggplant with about 2 tbsp of cornstarch and toss to fully coat. (If using regular eggplant cube into ~3/4 inch pieces) 
3. Combine all of the sauce ingredients and set aside.
4. Heat a swirl of veggie oil over medium-high heat in a wok or large skillet. Add the eggplant chunks and cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggplant is crispy in some places and soft all the way through, about 5-7 minutes. Try to position the eggplant so the cut sides are in contact with the pan. The eggplant will likely absorb the oil, but there’s no need to keep adding more. Once cooked, remove to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.
5. To the skillet, add another generous swirl of veggie oil. Once warm, add the cubed tofu pieces. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tofu is golden and crispy on most sides, about 10 minutes. Once cooked, remove to a plate. Note, using a spatula to flip the pieces is much easier than using tongs.
6. Add a little more oil to the skillet, once warm add the garlic and the whites of the green onion. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the sauce and mix everything together, then add the tofu and eggplant back to the skillet. Remove from heat and mix everything together. Top with the green onion greens and sesame seeds, serve immediately with white rice.

Edit: To answer a common question, Chinese eggplant are long and skinny compared to “regular” eggplant. This means when you cube them every piece has some skin on it, which helps them hold up better when stir-frying. Also, if your frying pan is not very non-stick you may have issues with the eggplant sticking to the pan, so watch out for that!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/xkbvxj/garlic_eggplant_crispy_tofu/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/xkbvxj/garlic_eggplant_crispy_tofu/

This is for an upcoming project for 5-ingredient vegan meals thus the sparse ingredients! 5 ingredients do not include water, cooking oil, salt, or pepper.

It was still super tasty and is a great recipe to build upon. You could easily add garlic, roasted poblano peppers, or extra plant or meat protein to the soup.

For extra plant protein, I would add white beans or tofu crumbles or top with fried tofu chorizo crumbles.

If you want to do meat, I would do something light like shrimp or chicken.

You can also get creative with toppings like what I suggested below or add some crispy tortillas, crushed crackers, finely chopped tomatoes, or minced red onion.

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced
* 1 cup quinoa, rinsed
* 5–6 cups of water or vegetable stock
* 2 ears of sweet corn, husked and cut from the cob
* 1 cup loosely packed cilantro, minced
* 6 ounces plant-based cream or coconut milk
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Sliced jalapeño
* Lime
* Cilantro

**Method:**

Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook in the oil for 6–7 minutes, turning occasionally, until they just begin to soften.

Add the quinoa to the potatoes and cook for 1 minute.

Pour in 5 cups of water or vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Once boiling, reduce heat to a hard simmer and cook for 20 minutes or until the quinoa is tender. If the soup is too thick, add the remaining 1 cup water or stock.

Add the corn, cilantro, and cream to the soup and simmer for an additional 5–6 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Ladle the chowder into bowls. Garnish with jalapeño slices, a lime wedge, and a few more cilantro leaves if you like. Enjoy!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/w4ik9j/easy_quinoacorn_chowder/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/w4ik9j/easy_quinoacorn_chowder/

It is a delicious addition to many Asian dishes, perfect for a hot sunny day. Great booster for your gut microbiome as well :)

I recommend you try Vaccum packing for your fermented products as it can save you space and create an anaerobic environment that prevents the development of unwanted pathogens. Here you can find the device and the bags at a good price.

**Ingredients:**

\* 700g of cucumbers (pickling variety)

\* 14g of salt (2% per cucumber weight)

\* 1 medium-sized carrot cut into 5cm julienne

\* a handful of chives

\* 3tbsp of Gochugaru (Korean chilli flakes)

\* 1,5tbsp of minced garlic

\* 2tsp of minced ginger

\* half of the red apple, grated

\* 1,5tbsp of sugar

\* 1tsp of minced Saeujeot (Korean salted shrimp)(use more fish sauce if not available)

\* 1tsp of fish sauce (Use dark soy sauce for vegetarian version)

**Instructions:**

1. Prepare cucumbers by removing their ends, then cut them in half lengthways. Now divide into 5cm parts and cut each part 3 times at an angle. Place in the large bowl with julienned carrots and chives then mix in the salt. Rest for 25 minutes.
2. In the meantime prepare Gochugaru paste by mixing all the remaining ingredients in a separate bowl.
3. Once cucumbers are ready combine them with paste.
4. Transfer everything into a jar or a vacuum bag and seal. Leave at room temperature for 2 days then move into the fridge. 
5.  Once chilled, Cucumber Kimchi is ready for consumption. It will develop more flavour over the next few days but it will lose the crunch and the cucumber will become mushier, so I don't recommend it for long time storage like traditional Kimchi.

sg8cym,Onion Bhajis with Chilli Sauce,2765,82,1643546349.0,0.98,Fruit\Vegetarian,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/xpcbah8jlte81.jpg,"Do you see them? chilling by that chilli sauce? One is about to jump in!

Onion Bhaji is one of my favourite Indian appetisers. I love their crunch and delicious inside. Dip them in a nice sauce and stuff it in your mouth, absolutely fantastic!

Super easy to prepare, served with various dips like mango chutney, mint yoghurt or chilli sauce. On this occasion I prepared simple chilli sauce from my Indian friend's recipe, try it yourself and you will not regret it.

**Ingredients for 15 Bhajis:**

\* 4 medium or 2 large white onions, cut in half and sliced

\* 1 green chilli, seeds removed and finely sliced

\* 1 medium potato, cut into fine matchsticks

\* 1tbsp of garlic and ginger paste

\* a handful of chopped fresh coriander

\* 1tsp of salt

\* 1tsp of mild chilli powder

\* 1tsp of ground coriander

\* 1tsp of turmeric

\* 1tsp of ground cumin

\* 1 large egg (you can skip for the vegan version, reduce the flour by 50g)

\* 150g (5.3oz) of gram flour (made of chickpeas)

\* 1L of vegetable oil for deep-fat frying

**Ingredients for chilli sauce:**

\* 1 red chilli, seeds removed and sliced

\* 1 red bell pepper, diced

\* 1 garlic clove

\* juice of a half lemon

\* 50ml of water

\* 1/4tsp of salt

\* 1/4tsp of sugar

\* 1/4tsp of ground cumin

**Instructions for Bhajis:**

1. Preheat a deep fat fryer or a small pot with oil to 170C (340F) (you can check pot oil temperature with an electric probe)
2. Mix sliced onions with potato matchsticks, green chilli, garlic ginger paste, fresh coriander, salt and spices. Do so until all onions are coated with colours.
3. Mix in one egg to coat the onions then add chickpea flour, combine until no signs of dry flour is left.
4. Use gloves for protection, take a small amount of Bhaji mix and shape in your hands into a ball (do not compress the mix) put it gently into the hot oil. Cook Bhajis until golden-brown then flip upside down for another minute or so to colour the topside. I recommend using a spider strainer or tongs to remove Bhajis from the oil. Place them onto a kitchen paper to drain excess fat.
5. Do it in a few batches until all Bhajis are done, serve straight away or reheat in the oven later before serving.

**Instructions for Chilli sauce:**

1. Place all the ingredients in the bullet like this one and blend into a smooth chilli sauce.
2. Transfer into a bowl to allow air bubbles to escape, then transfer into a serving dish.

Smacznego!

It is prepared with Tteok - delicious, chewy rice cakes served with Gochujang-based sauce. There are many different varieties of the dish, with many different ingredients. Some of them are eggs, seafood, tofu, ramen, and even cheese.

Check out my recipe for the vegetarian version with smoked tofu, daikon cabbage, and shitake mushrooms. It was absolutely fantastic and it pairs perfectly with my homemade kimchi.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

\* 500g of Tteok (You can get them online or from the Asian supermarket, they come fresh, dry, or frozen. Depending on what type of Tteok you got, some require soaking in water before cooking)

\* 150g of shitake mushrooms, cut in half

\* 200g of smoked tofu

\*1 shallot, sliced

\* 4 garlic cloves, minced

\* 1/4 of medium-sized daikon cabbage, sliced

\* 400ml of water

\* 3tbsp of Gochujang paste

\* 3tbsp of sweet soy sauce (it contains less salt, add less if using standard soy sauce)

\* sesame oil for frying

\* spring onions for garnish

\* sesame seeds for garnish

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

1. Slice tofu into four slabs and pan-fry on high heat with sesame oil until golden brown on both sides. When ready add 2tbsp of sweet soy sauce and glaze all around, set aside on the plate ready for later (chop into cubes).
2. Stir-fry shallot and mushrooms until cooked through, add sliced cabbage and continue cooking for another minute. Season with 1tbsp of soy sauce and remove from the pan ready for later.
3. In the deep frying pan bring 400ml of water to boil and whisk in 3tbsp of Gochujang chilli paste. Add Tteok and boil them in the sauce until cooked through (Use the packet instructions as a guide, cook longer if you prefer them softer, it takes around 10 minutes plus for the dry ones)
4. Once Tteok is ready add your stir-fried veggies and diced tofu. Adjust the seasoning and serve garnished with sliced spring onions and sesame seeds. Smacznego!

rg96ku,Turkish Spiral Pastry w/ Spinach-Cheese Filling AKA Kol Börek,1865,31,1639493712.0,0.98,Fruit\Vegetarian,unitedcuisines,https://i.redd.it/lkb2chltui581.jpg,"There're many tasty types of Borek, a pastry dish super popular in Turkey and many other countries in the Mediterranean. I decided to make this spiral-shaped beauty, filled with spinach and soft brine cheese. Moreover, I reached out to our Greek friends and used their ultra thin Filo / Phyllo dough sheets, in order to get a super crisp Kol Borek (Turkish, which translates to ""arm borek/pastry"").

**Enjoy the recipe and the latest episode of United Cuisines on Youtube!**

INGREDIENTS

* Filo / Phyllo dough sheets \[10 oz / 300 g\]
* spinach \[1 lb / 450 g\]
* Turkish ""white cheese"" or Greek Feta \[7 oz / 200 g\]
* vegetable oil \[1/3 cup / 80 g\]
* clarified butter \[3 oz / 90 g\]
* 1 medium-sized onion
* Aleppo chili flakes \[1 tsp\]
* salt &amp; pepper to taste
* sesame &amp; nigella seeds

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Wash and roughly cut the spinach, peel and chop the onion into small cubes
2. Sauté spinach in a pan over medium-low heat with a tablespoon of olive oil. Add the first batch of spinach, which will wilt and considerably shrink in size quickly. Using a kitchen tong, turn it upside down, let wilt, add another batch, and repeat till all the spinach is in the pan. Cook for 3 minutes, mixing and turning multiple times. Transfer into a bowl and let cool down
3. In the same pan, sauté the onion with some olive oil over medium heat for 3-5 minutes, till translucent
4. Grab the spinach, squeeze the water out of it and transfer the greens into the pan. Combine spinach and onion, season with salt &amp; pepper to taste and mix in a teaspoon of Aleppo peppers
5. Transfer into the bowl of earlier, let cool down, crumble the white cheese/Feta over it and combine well
6. In parallel, put the vegetable oil and clarified butter into a small saucepan  and place it over low heat. Let heat up till the butter is fully melted and set aside
7. Grease a round oven-safe dish - preferably metal - with the butter-oil mix
8. Grab one ultra-thin dough/filo sheet and paint it with the butter-oil, before placing a second sheet on top and greasing it as well
9. Spread a generous amount of the spinach-cheese filling along the long side of the rectangle. Grab the sheet at the same end where the filling is and start rolling - not too loose, nor too tight. Place it along the rim of the greased oven pan, follow up with the next rolls and spiral inwards till the pan is fully covered
10. Brush with some more of the butter-oil mix, sprinkle with sesame and nigella seeds and bake at 180°C/360°F on the lower third of your conventional oven for around 45 minutes till golden and crisp. Monitor the process, as baking/browning can vary strongly depending on your oven
11. Enjoy!

* 1 tbsp fish sauce
* 1½ tsp aleppo chilli flakes (or 1 tsp regular chilli flakes)

* ¼ tbsp soft light brown sugar
* 50g cherry tomatoes 
* 2 limes; 1 juiced, to get 1½ tbsp, the other cut into 6 wedges, to serve

* 2 pointed cabbages (aka sweetheart or hispi cabbage), quartered lengthways
* Flaked sea salt
* 5g coriander, finely chopped
* tahini, soy sauce, lemon juice, minced garlic

METHOD

1. First make the nam prik. Put the galangal and garlic in the small bowl of a food processor and blitz. Add the fish sauce, chilli, tamarind, sugar, tomatoes and lime juice, blitz again, then tip into a small bowl and stir in a teaspoon and a half of the oil.

2. Cut the potatoes into cubes, and roast them in in a pan. Mix the sesame paste, soy sauce, lemon and garlic. Later, serve both with the cabbage, and sprinkle with sesame seeds. 

3. Toss the cabbage quarters in the remaining oil and a teaspoon of salt, then lay them on a very hot barbecue or griddle pan, and grill for four to five minutes on each side (ie, 12-15 minutes in total), until it has clear grill marks all over, and has softened on the outside but still has a crunch. 

4.  Transfer to a platter, overlapping the cabbage quarters in places. Add the coriander to the nam prik, then spoon evenly over the cabbage pieces. Serve either warm or at room temperature, with the lime wedges.

## Equipment

* Skillet
* 9×13 Baking Dish
* Baking sheet

## Ingredients

* 1 pound challah or brioche bread cut into bite-sized cubes
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 sweet onions peeled and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons butter divided
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 4 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and small-diced
* 1 tablespoon fresh thyme minced
* 1 tablespoon fresh sage leaves minced
* 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary minced
* 3 cups vegetable stock
* 2 eggs
* 4 tablespoons butter melted
* 2 teaspoons fig miso or white miso
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Cooking spray or butter for greasing the baking dish

## Instructions

## Dry out the bread:

* Preheat oven to 200ºF. Arrange the diced bread on a baking sheet and transfer to the oven for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, grease a 9×13 baking dish.
* Remove the bread from the oven and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Turn the heat on the oven to 350ºF.

## Caramelize the onions:

* Heat the oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes until they just begin to deepen in color. Sprinkle with salt and reduce heat to medium-low. Continue cooking for 30 minutes or until the onions begin to caramelize. Stir them occasionally, but don’t disturb them too often or else they won’t caramelize.
* Melt 1 tablespoon butter into the onions and sprinkle the sugar on top. Continue cooking for 10–15 minutes until they are fully caramelized.
* Spoon half of the onions into a bowl and pour the remaining half over the diced bread and toss gently to distribute them evenly.

## Cook the celery:

* Return the skillet to the stovetop over medium heat. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter into the celery and cook for 7–8 minutes until it just begins to soften. Add the minced herbs and toss to coat. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the celery mixture over the bread and toss gently to distribute the celery evenly.

## Prepare the liquid:

* Combine the vegetable stock and eggs in a bowl and whisk until completely combined. Pour over the bread.

## Bake the stuffing:

* Scatter the remaining caramelized onions on top of the stuffing. Cover with foil and transfer to the oven for 35 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking an additional 10 minutes until the middle has set and the top is golden brown. Remove the stuffing from the oven and turn on the broiler.

## Prepare the miso butter:

* Combine the melted butter and miso in a bowl and whisk until smooth. Pour the mixture over the stuffing.

## Broil the stuffing:

* Transfer the stuffing to the oven under the broiler for 2–3 minutes. Keep an eye on it so that it doesn’t burn, but the butter should cause the bread to crisp up and turn deep golden brown. Remove from the oven.

## To serve:

* Serve the stuffing warm. Keep leftovers in an airtight container for 3–4 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer for up to a month. Enjoy!

q7c97n,Turkish Cheese Roll Pastry AKA Sigara Börek,1713,26,1634135010.0,0.98,Fruit\Vegetarian,unitedcuisines,https://i.redd.it/irewa74p88t71.jpg,"You need no more than a handful of ingredients and only 15 minutes to prepare Sigara Böregi, which translates to cigarette/cigar pastry. It is usually filled with cheese and tastes great!

**Enjoy the recipe and join** r/UnitedCuisines, **where you can also find our YouTube show!**

INGREDIENTS:

\- Yufka pastry leaves (no fat phyllo sheets) \[ 7 oz / 200 g\] (cut in triangles)

\- a handful flat Italian parsley

\- soft brine cheese (e.g. Feta) \[6 oz / 180 g\]

\- vegetable oil \[1 cup / 250 ml\]

\- 1 fresh egg (optional)

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Chop the parsley and, in a big enough bowl, mix with the crumbled cheese/feta. In addition, you can add a beaten egg (optional), which mostly acts as a binding agent
2. Before you start rolling your Boreks, keep a small bowl of water close by, which will help so seal your pastry. Grab a triangle, place it in front of you, the short side facing towards you and the tip of the long sides away from you. And spread a tablespoon of your cheese filling along the short side. Leave around half an inch, or 1-2 cm, border right and left, which you fold, before you start rolling your cigar. Apply a enough pressure to keep the folded corners of the pastry sheets in when rolling, but don't be too firm, otherwise, you will squeeze out the cheese filling
3. To seal your cigar börek, just dip the tip of the sheet in water, finish the rolling process and the sheet will stick to itself. Proceed and roll as many Cigara Böreks as possible (10-20, depending on the triangles' size and how much filling you grant one Borek)
4. Pour the vegetable oil in a pan and heat it up over medium high till its temperature reaches 350°F or 180°C. Keep a second plate, covered with kitchen towel, ready, on which you'll drain your fried rolls
5. Fry rolls till they turn strongly golden, almost brown. Don't overcrowd the pan and leave a little space between them. Which you should turn upside down a few times and remove from the oil in time, before they darken too much. It took us only 1-3 minutes in total per roll
6. Shortly drain on kitchen towel, before being piled up on your serving plate

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 15 minutes

Inactive Time:: 1 hour

Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

Servings: 6

Calories: 425kcal

## Equipment

* Large pot
* Sieve or colander
* Skillet

## Ingredients

* 1 pound small dry white beans, soaked according to package instructions; or use 2 15-ounce cans navy beans and drain and rinse them first
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 2 shallots peeled and diced, or use any onion variety
* 3 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and diced
* 2 tablespoons butter plant-based or dairy, optional
* 12 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and thinly sliced
* 2 teaspoons silk chili flakes (or use 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper/cayenne powder plus a little paprika)
* 1/2 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1/2 teaspoon dry parsley
* 6 cups water or vegetable stock plus more if needed
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Mushroom topping (optional):

* 2 tablespoons butter plant-based or dairy
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 4 ounces mushrooms of your choice such as beech, cremini, or shiitake
* 1 ounce pine nuts, almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, or your favorite nut/seed of choice
* Salt to taste

## For serving:

* Fresh parsley minced

## Instructions

## Soak the beans (optional):

* If using dry beans, soak them according to package instructions in a large pot. Small beans may only need an hour or two of soaking time. Drain them and set them aside. Return the pot to the stovetop and wipe it out.

## Cook the aromatics:

* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in the large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the shallots and celery and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 6-7 minutes. Season lightly with salt.

## Cook the mushrooms:

* Melt the butter into the shallot and celery. Once frothy, add the mushrooms. Cook for 8-10 minutes until the mushrooms release all their liquid and begin to brown and crisp up around the edges. Season with salt.

## Cook the beans:

* Add the silk chili, thyme, and parsley and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the soaked beans and toss to coat.

## Simmer the beans:

* Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for at least 30 minutes or until the beans are tender. Small beans, like the Alubia Blanca, take around 1 hour to become tender. If using canned beans, simmer for only 30 minutes. Add more stock or water as necessary if the broth evaporates too quickly—taste and season with salt and pepper.

## Cook the topping:

* Once the beans are ready to be served, prepare the topping. Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat until melted and frothy. Add the mushrooms and cook for 3 minutes until they begin to brown. Add the pine nuts and cook for an additional 2 minutes until browned. Be careful not to burn the pine nuts! Turn off the heat and season lightly with flaky sea salt.

## To serve:

* Ladle the cooked beans into bowls and garnish with minced parsley. Scatter the warm mushroom and pine nuts on top. Enjoy!

The high humidity and cold temperatures of this season work in favour of mycelium, bringing us a vast variety of delicious mushrooms. On my short staycation in Lake District, I found a few beautiful Porcini mushrooms that you can see in the picture as well as multiple Larch Boletes referred to in my country as butter mushrooms. They have slimy caps and are perfect for sauces, soups or pickles. As the name suggests Larch Bolete can be found growing in symbiosis with Larch trees starting in July till November.  
  
This is my family recipe for a delicious and filling mushroom soup, perfect after a fungi hunt. It contains pasta and a variety of vegetables that elevate the mushroom flavour. The recipe works with Boletus mushrooms but if not available you can prepare them with chestnut mushrooms instead.  
  
In Poland, mushroom picking is very popular among families and the knowledge is passed from generation to generation. Make sure to always pick mushrooms with someone who knows what they doing, or pick specimens that are hard to confuse, I always recommend signing up for a foraging experience! It is great fun and you can learn something new! :)  
  
This recipe makes 4 portions  
  
  
  
**Ingredients:**  
  
\- 400g (14.1oz) of sliced Boletus mushrooms (or chestnut mushrooms)  
  
\- 1 medium-size onion, diced  
  
\- 4 garlic cloves, sliced  
  
\- 2 medium carrots, small dice  
  
\- half celery stick, small dice  
  
\- 3-inch piece of leek, small dice  
  
\- 1 large potato small dice  
  
\- 1tbsp olive oil  
  
\- 1tsp of butter  
  
\- 1,5L of vegetable stock  
  
\- 150g (5.3oz) of penne pasta  
  
\- 100ml of double cream  
  
\- 1 bay leaf  
  
\- black pepper  
  
\- parsley to garnish  
  
\- 1tsp of yoghurt per plate mixed in before serving (optional)  
  
  
  
**Instructions:**  
  
1.In a frying pan, preheat 1tbsp of olive oil. Add diced onion and 4 sliced garlic cloves, cook on medium heat for 5 minutes or until softened. Add sliced mushrooms with 1tsp of butter and turn up the heat to medium-high, cook for another 5 minutes. Once mushrooms are done remove from the heat and set aside ready for later.  
  
2.In a large pot add 1,5L of vegetable stock, carrots, celery, leek, potato and bay leaf. Bring to the boil and reduce to simmer. Cook for 10 minutes.  
  
3.Next, add 150g of penne pasta and cook for another 10 minutes.  
  
4.Add fried mushrooms, onions and garlic. Continue cooking for another 5 minutes.  
  
5.At this point, pasta should be cooked through and mushrooms should hold the shape, if the soup seems too thick add a little bit more water.  
  
6.Take one ladle of soup with no solids out of the pot and mix it with 100ml of double cream. Pour the mixture back to the pot. (This prevents the cream from splitting)  
  
7.Check the seasoning and serve garnished with freshly cracked black pepper and chopped parsley. You can mix in 1tsp of yoghurt just before serving to increase the sourness to your liking. Enjoy!

\- 1 pound Asparagus trimmed of tough ends  
\- 2 tablespoons olive oil  
\- 1 cup frozen peas  
\- Salt and pepper to taste  
**Instructions**  
1. Prep the pie crust at least 30 minutes in advance. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, celery seed, and salt. Add cold butter, and using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut the butter into the flour until there are only small, peas sizes pieces of butter visible in the flour. Next add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing with your hand or a spatula after each addition, until the dough begins to stick together. Using your hands, form the dough into a flat disk. Cover with plastic wrap, and chill at least 30 minutes.  
2. Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss asparagus with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper. Roast until slightly fork tender, about 10-15 minutes. Once the asparagus is out of the oven, raise the temp to 425°F.  
3. Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat in a medium skillet. Add leeks and a pinch of salt, and sauté until softened and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add frozen peas, and sauté until thawed completely, another 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.  
4. On a floured surface, roll out the dough until it's large enough to line a 9 inch round pie pan. Line pie pan with pie dough, prick bottom with a fork several times, then crumble half of the goat cheese and spread along bottom. Next add leeks and peas and spread evenly throughout the dish. Then crumble the rest of the goat cheese. Lastly arrange asparagus on top of the fillings.  
5. Add eggs to a mixing bowl, and beat slightly. Then add heavy cream, 1 teaspoon salt, sugar, and cayenne and whisk to combine. Pour egg mixture evenly over other ingredients in the pie dish.  
6. Bake at 425°F for 15 minutes. Then lower the temperature to 300°F and bake 35-40 minutes, or until set with just a slight wobble in the middle.

This is the first time we tried Persian saffron rice, combined with yogurt and barberries into a golden cake. The ""savory sweetness"" is yummie and the crispy rice an eye-catcher: give it a try!

**INGREDIENTS:**

\- XL basmati rice \[ 1.5 cups / 300 gram\]

\- plain yogurt \[0.75 cups / 180 gram\]

\- vegetable oil \[1/3 cups / 70 gram\]

\- salt \[0.5 tbsp / 9 gram\]

35 g fat, 89 g carbs, 17 g protein

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Melt butter over medium-low, add barberries and sugar, fry for 2-3 minutes and set aside. Make sure not to burn the barberries
2. Grind saffron: we used a mortar and pestle. A pinch of salt helps with grinding. Add 2 tablespoons of water, mix and let cool down
3. In big enough bowl, mix yogurt, salt, oil, egg-yolks and saffron 
4. Wash rice under lukewarm water, rinse till the starch is fully washed of and the water not blurry anymore. Let drain
5. Boil 6 cups / 1.5 liter of water, salt it generously to make it salty as the sea
6. Add rice and boil for 6-8 minutes, till it's soft on the outside, but still firm inside. Usually the first rice kernels start floating, when this is the case
7. Rinse rice over cold water, this helps to prevent the rice from sticking to each other, and drain
8. Mix into the bowl with yogurt mix. Gently, don't break the rice kernels
9. Pre-heat the oven to 410°F/210°C 
10. Transfer half of the rice-yogurt mix into an oven-safe form, and sprinkle half of the barberries over
11. Cover with remaining rice and gently press with a spatula to an even form, with no excess space between rice and form, to make it as crispy as possible
12. Cover the top of the form with kitchen foil and bake on mid-low level for 55-90 minutes. In our electric oven it took almost 90 minutes to get the outside nicely golden, but monitor the process, your oven might differ
13. Take out of oven, take the foil off (otherwise the steam will soften your crispy rice) and let cool for a few minutes
14. Place a plate on top of the form and turn it upside down
15. Sprinkle the cake with the remaining barberries
16. Enjoy!

Ingredients  
US Customary or Metric

  
Baked tofu seasonings  
14 ounces extra firm tofu  
1 tablespoon neutral oil (vegetable or avocado)  
½ teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon nutritional yeast (optional)  
1 tablespoon corn starch  
1 teaspoon garlic powder  


Maple miso glaze  
1 tablespoon miso paste (any color is fine but I used red)  
2 tablespoons water  
¼ cup low sodium soy sauce  
2 tablespoons maple syrup  
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil  
2 tablespoons rice vinegar  
1 tablespoon minced ginger  
1 tablespoon minced garlic  
1 teaspoon sriracha (optional if you don't like spice)  
1 teaspoon corn starch  


Instructions  
Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees  
Take the tofu out of the package and press for 15 minutes if you have a tofu press and 30 minutes if you don't.  
Cut the tofu into cubes. Add it to a large mixing bowl. Add the oil, salt, nutritional yeast, garlic powder and corn starch. Gently mix until everything is mixed together well. Be gentle while stirring to make sure you don't break the tofu.  
Add the tofu to a lined baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes or until tofu is crispy and golden brown.  
While tofu is baking make the marinade. In a small bowl or mug add 2-3 tablespoons of water to one tablespoon of miso paste. Stir until miso dissolves. Add the rest of the ingredients in the maple miso glaze section to the miso mixture. Mix well.  
Once tofu has finished baking, add the maple miso glaze to a saute pan on the stove on medium low heat. Stir constantly until sauce starts to thicken. This takes about 1-2 minutes.  
After sauce has started to thicken, add the baked tofu and stir until the tofu is well coated. Keep the tofu on the stove until the sauce starts to caramelize and become sticky on the tofu.

Pears are a perfect fruit for charring and these charred pears with harissa chickpeas are an incredible way to use them.

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 30 minutes

Total Time: 40 minutes

Servings: 4 

Calories: 363kcal 

### Equipment

* Wide skillet

### Ingredients

* 4 pears quartered and seeds removed
* 1 tablespoon oil for frying
* 1 yellow onion peeled and sliced into half-moons
* 1 tablespoon plant-based butter optional
* 1-2 tablespoons harissa paste or use a mix of chili powder, paprika, and cayenne powder
* 2 cups vegetable stock
* 2 15- ounce cans of chickpeas drained
* 3 ounces baby spinach
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Flaky sea salt optional
* Minced parsley or any herb of your choice optional, for garnish

### Instructions

#### Cook the pears:

* Heat the oil in a wide skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pears in batches, cut-side down, and cook without moving for 2-5 minutes. The sugars may burn slightly, but you want to get a nice char. Tip the pear onto the other cut side and cook that side until it chars; an additional 2-5 minutes.
* You don’t need to cook the skin side of the pear. If your pears aren’t very ripe, you’ll want to cook them a little longer to allow them to soften, but very ripe pears don’t need to cook long. Transfer the charred pears to a plate and sprinkle with salt.

#### Cook the onion:

* Add the onion to the skillet and cook for 8-10 minutes until it begins to soften—season with salt and pepper. Melt the plant-based butter (if using) into the onion. Once frothy, add the harissa paste (or spices) and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

#### Simmer the chickpeas:

* Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Add the chickpeas. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until the broth has reduced slightly and the onions have softened–about 15 minutes. If the liquid reduces too much, add a bit more stock or water—taste and season with salt and pepper.
* Stir in the spinach and cook for 5 minutes until wilted. Turn off the heat.

#### To serve:

* Ladle the chickpeas between bowls and arrange the charred pear on top. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro. Enjoy!

Just grab one floret and dip it in the sauce :)

### What is Tikka Masala sauce and where it comes from?

The history of this popular sauce is not 100% clear, some say it was created in India while others say it was created in the UK by Bangladeshi migrant Chefs. Whoever did it, did a good job, the sauce is one of the most popular in the world thanks to its mild and delicate flavour. In short, it is the smooth tomato-based curry sauce with the addition of **garam masala** and finished with yoghurt. The sauce is usually served with dry roasted marinated chicken or lamb (Tikka). From my experience, every Chef prepares it differently, what are your experiences with this sauce?

### Ingredients for Tikka Masala sauce:

* 1tbsp butter
* 1 banana shallot, finely diced
* 2 garlic cloves, minced

Sauce Pan

Skillet (or two to make this easier)



**COOKING TIME**
Prep: 5 mins

Cook: 10 mins

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 Cup Oats
* 500ml Stock (I used Mushroom)
* 2 cloves garlic (substitute with garlic paste if you wish)
* 1 Spring Onion
* 3 Spring Green leaves
* 210g Mushrooms
* 1/4 Block Extra firm tofu
* 1 tsp Miso Paste (optional)
* Soy Sauce
* Sriracha to marinate the Tofu
* Sesame Togarashi

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Prepare your stock, I used a mushroom stock cube with 500ML of water.
1. Add your oats to the sauce pan and 1/2 of the stock, in a minute or two add the remaining stock until you reach your desired consistency.
1. Roll the spring greens tightly and chop in to 2mm slices.
1. Chop your protein, I used extra firm tofu
1. Slice the spring onion, larges pieces for more bite, smaller if you wish.
1. Slice your mushrooms.
1. Slice or mush your garlic, an added step might be to lightly fry the garlic for added crispy texture if you slice it..
1. Add the mushrooms to the skillet on medium/high heat and begin cooking them down, as they begin to shrink add some soy sauce and let the shrooms absorb it.
1. Toss the greens to the pan with the shrooms, add a little soy sauce and continue to toss until cooked, add a drizzle of water and the garlic, this should take around 5 minutes.
1. Whilst cooking your veggies, begin cooking your protein in a separate pan.


Around 2-3 minutes later, everything should be cooked.


**TO SERVE**

Add the oats to the bowl, followed by the greens and tofu, finish with some sesame seeds or Togarashi.

Super fluffy and sweet bun with a savoury mouthwatering stuffing. By the time you finish the first one, you will be thinking about another one!

**What are Kapuśniaczki?**

This Polish pasty is prepared for special occasions like Christmas and throughout the year as a snack. Different types of dough are used ranging from crunchy to more fluffy.

On many occasions, puff pastry is used as well for the convenience of preparation. Wild mushrooms are also used as an addition to the filling giving it more depth and richness. Exceptionally good when served with borscht. In some regions of Poland also called ''Paszteciki''

📷📷

This recipe makes 10 pasties

**Ingredients for the filling:**

* 700g (1.54pounds) of Sauerkraut
* 500ml (o.53quarts) of hot water
* 300g (0.66pounds) of brown mushrooms, cut in half and sliced
* 300g of red onions (3 medium-sized) finely sliced
* 2tbsp of oil
* 1tsp of butter
* 2 bay leaves
* 3 allspice berries
* salt and black pepper

**Ingredients for the dough:**

* 500g (1.1pounds) of plain flour
* pinch of salt
* 60g (2.1oz) granulated sugar
* 60g butter
* 130ml (0.135quarts) milk
* 40ml (3tbsp) water
* 30g (1oz) fresh yeast or 15g (0.5oz) of active dry yeast
* 2 eggs (plus 1more for brushing)
* 2tsp of caraway seeds for topping

**Recipe logistics:**

In this recipe sauerkraut needs to be boiled first, in the meantime, you can prepare the dough as it needs time to prove. Once that is done get going with the second part of the filling. Once the dough is ready, roll it, score it, place the filling inside, wrap, brush and bake - Job done.

**Instructions for the filling:**

**1.** Simmer **700g of Sauerkraut** in **500ml of water** with the addition of **2 bay leaves** and **3 allspice berries** for **2,5h**, remember to cover the pot with a lid. Once cooked through, drain from the liquid, discard spices, allow to cool then chop it with a knife. (Sauerkraut will be nice and soft)

**2.** While waiting for sauerkraut, get a medium-sized frying pan and heat **2tbsp of oil**. Sweat the **onions** in **medium heat** for around **5 minutes**. Next, add **mushrooms** and **turn up the heat**. Pan fry until mushrooms are cooked through and start to brown, then stir in **1tsp of butter** and season with **salt and black pepper**.

**3.** Mix chopped sauerkraut with mushrooms and onions, check the seasoning. It should be slightly salty and sour with little sweetness from onions.

**Instructions for the dough:**

**1.** Begin by heating up **130ml of milk** with **60g of butter** in a small pan until butter is dissolved. Next, transfer this mixture to the different pan, **add 40 ml (8tsp) of cold water** to bring the temperature down. Then mix in your **fresh** **yeast** until dissolved, set aside.

**2.** Mix **500g of flour** with a **pinch of salt** and **60g of sugar**, add **yeast mixture** and **2 eggs**. Mix it until combined and place in the bowl to prove (dough will be sticky, do not add any more flour). **Prove until tripled in size (1-1,5h)**.

**3.** Once the dough is proved, preheat the oven to **165C (330F)** and divide the dough into 10 balls around **100g each**, roll each ball into a **16cm square (6inch)**. Then make **five 3cm cuts on the left and right side of the square**. Place **80g of the filling** in the middle and braid the dough by pulling each cut to the opposite side starting from the left to right. Brush with **egg**, dust with **caraway seeds** and bake on the tray with baking paper for around **20 minutes** (bake in batches or 2 separate trays, remember to give then some space for expansion)

**4.** Remove from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack, eat while warm you can also heat them up in the microwave on the next day. Enjoy!

kuezx3,Beetroot risotto with creamy goat cheese,115,19,1610287492.0,0.98,Fruit\Vegetarian,Zamezi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kuezx3,"Beetroot risotto with creamy goat cheese. 

For the full recipe with step by step pictures: [http://meza-blog.com/recipe/beetroot-risotto/](http://meza-blog.com/recipe/beetroot-risotto/)

**INGREDIENTS**

**Risotto:**

 

* 2 medium beetroots
* 170 gr rice, arborio or carnarroli
* 140 ml water
* 1 onion
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 dl white wine
* 0.5 liter vegetable stock, (more if needed)
* 1 tablespoon butter, preferably room temp
* 20 gr grated parmesan cheese

**garnish:**

* 50 gr fresh goat cheese
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* pinch of salt
* 1/2 teaspoon orange zest

**METHOD:**

 

1)Start by making the puree for your risotto. Simply place your beetroots in a baking tray, cover with aluminum foil and place inside a pre heated oven on 180\*C.

2)Bake the beetroots until fork tender (piercing a fork inside without applying any pressure). Time may vary from 45 minutes to 2 hours.

3)Once fork tender, peel the skin off, dice the beets roughly and blend with a stix mixer.  
your beatiful beetroot puree is now ready to use!

For the garnish:

1)Place your cheese, olive oil and salt into a shallow mixing bowl and blend well with a stix mixer.

2)Pass the creamy mixture through a fine sieve to assure a more stable texture.

3)Mix well with the orange zest and set aside for further use.

For the risotto:

1)Start by preparing the rice. Take a skillet or shallow pot and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your rice.

2)Stir constantly for about 2-3 minutes until the edges of the grain start becoming translucent.

3)Now that we build a protective layer around the grain, pour in your water and stir frequently until all the water has evaporated.

4)Transfer the rice onto a tin, and let cool.

5)Once cool, your rice is ready to use. This is a neat little step worth making when cooking risotto as it helps release more of that starchy goodness later on when cooking the risotto. Par-cooked rice like this can last up to a week in a food container in your fridge and will greatly shorten your time preparing risotto.

6)Now take your skillet and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle over a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your diced onions.

7)Saute the onions until soft and translucent. It will probably take in between 7-10 minutes.

8)Once your onions are beautifully tender, add in your finely minced garlic and stir for another minute.

9)Now add in your rice and season with salt and pepper. (This is the perfect time to add salt as it will drain any extra juices which will be absorbed by the rice.)

10)Stir constantly for another minute or two and proceed to pour in your wine.

11)Keep stirring (from this moment on, you’ll have to be stirring most of the time as more motion the rice makes, the more starch it releases, creating a creamy texture.) until all the wine has evaporated.

12)Now that your wine has evaporated, add 3 tablespoons of your beetroot pure and stir until incorporated.  


13)Now start adding your vegetable stock (hot! so it doesn’t prevent the rice from continuing to cook.) a little at a time as the rice absorbs the liquid. The reason you don’t pour it all at the same time is because you don’t know how much liquid the rice will absorb.  


14)When the rice is cooked al-dente  it should still have a slightly “runny to watery” texture, we don’t want it thick.

15)Now turn off the heat and add the butter, preferably room temperature so it blends more quickly

16)Once you add the butter, now is the time to really work your hand, and give the rice a good beating, stirring it vigorously until all the butter has blended with the dish.  


17)After the butter has blended add the parmesan cheese and beat again, this time not as vigorously until the cheese has melted.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kuezx3/beetroot_risotto_with_creamy_goat_cheese/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kuezx3/beetroot_risotto_with_creamy_goat_cheese/

kdsbhv,My dad's Perfect Chinese Broccoli w/ Oyster Sauce (蚝蠔芥蘭)!,1309,52,1608059909.0,0.98,Fruit\Vegetarian,madewithlau,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kdsbhv,"Excited to share a recipe my dad has literally made 100,000 times over his career as a chef and a dad.

Also known as “gaai láan” in Cantonese, this is a super easy recipe that I ate almost every single week growing up. Even for a “simple” dinner, my dad would have at least 3 or 4 courses, and Chinese broccoli was (and is) always in the rotation as his go-to vegetable dish for us kiddos.

We'll also be going over:

* How to pick the freshest Chinese Broccoli
* How to store gai lan at home
* How to get the perfect, soft, crunchy texture for gai lan
* Dietary alternatives to oyster sauce

Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi3FB2NtLCc&amp;&amp;list=PLvd5bo3J-_kq4FcYVCOK6ZR87dCGDqrSH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s) for a walkthrough.

## THE RECIPE

Overview

* Prep Time: 3 min
* Total Time: 10 min
* Yield: 4 servings

Ingredients

* 1 lb **chinese broccoli**
* 8 cups **boiling water**
* 1 tbsp **oyster sauce**
* 1 tbsp **olive oil**

# Step 1 - Guide to Gai Lan: An Overview

* Here's a brief overview of what we'll be doing and how to get the perfect texture:
* Boil an abundance of water
* Add olive oil and salt to the water
* Bring the water to a boil BEFORE adding the gai lan
* Bring to a boil again, and cook the Chinese broccoli for 1 to 2 minutes

# Step 2 - Wash gai lan, heat wok, boil water

As always, my dad says to thoroughly wash our veggies.

We'll turn our stove on to its highest heat and set the wok on top of it. Start boiling **water** (8 cups)​ - the amount doesn't have to be exact, but more is better.

The less time we spend cooking Chinese broccoli, the better. And one key way to achieve a faster cooking time is to use a larger volume of boiling water.

Chinese restaurants are able to cook gai lan incredibly quickly, because they use larger woks on more powerful stoves.

# Step 3 - Add olive oil, salt

Next, well add **olive oil** (1 tbsp) and **salt** to the water.

In my dad's words, this is almost like ""make up"" for the Chinese broccoli, and it helps the gai lan retain a fresh green color and adds a beautiful shimmer.

# Step 4 - Wait for boil, add gai lan, cover

It is critical that our water starts boiling before we add the Chinese broccoli. We want to keep the cook time as short as possible.

Since every piece of gai lan is uniquely shaped, if you notice that there are pieces of gai lan that have a thicker stem, we can take a knife and cut down the middle of the stem about 1-2 inches.

This helps increase the stem's cooking surface area and helps it cook faster, and also helps all of the different sized pieces of gai lan cook evenly.

Once the water is boiling, add the gai lan, and cover the wok. If they're not fully submerged, add more hot/boiling water.

# Step 5 - Bring to a boil, cook for 1-2 minutes

In total, once the wok comes to a boil again, we'll only need to cook our gai lan for 1 to 2 minutes.

As the wok starts to come to a boil, about halfway there, you can flip the gai lan.

More on why we want to cook Chinese broccoli as soon as possible:

* The less time that the gai lan is sitting in the boiling water, the less nutrients it loses, and the less chlorophyll it loses.
* It's not only healthier, but it will look more mouthwatering when we're done.

# Step 6 - Uncover wok, taste

Once 1 to 2 minutes are up, uncover the wok. Cut off a piece of stem and chew on it.

If it's crunchy to your liking, you're done! If you'd prefer it to be softer, you can cook it for another 1-3 minutes.

# Step 7 - Make final touches

Once you're happy with the texture, turn off the heat and transfer the gai lan to a plate.

Take scissors and make 1 to 2 cuts along the stems and leaves to make the gai lan easier to eat.

Then, we'll drizzle some **oyster sauce** (1 tbsp) and more olive oil to taste.

Call your loved ones over - time to eat!

\-------

# How to select fresh Chinese Broccoli

My parents get into a lot of detail in our video's Meal Time section, but we're looking for a few cues:

* The stem should be a light, fresh color
* The stem should easily snap in half
* The leaves should be a deeper green
* The flowers buds, if any, should be green (not yellow)

# How to store Chinese Broccoli

When you get home from the store, line some trays with paper towels and lay each piece across the trays for 4-5 hours.Poke a few holes in a plastic bag, loosely wrap the paper towels around the gai lan, and place them in the bag.Store the bag in a vegetable compartment if you have one.

# Alternatives to Oyster Sauce

If you're vegetarian or need to stay away from gluten, we have three alternatives for you!

**Vegetarian Oyster Sauce**

Since oyster sauce is made out of oyster extract, here are some alternatives that have a similar taste without using the actual oyster:

* Wan Ja Shan Vegetarian Mushroom Oyster Sauce
* Lee Kum Kee Vegetarian Stir Fry Sauce

**Gluten Free Oyster Sauce**

Wok Mei has a gluten-free oyster sauce, but it still contains oyster extract, so it's not vegetarian friendly.

**Vegetarian + Gluten Free Oyster Sauce**

Unfortunately, we don't know of a vendor that sells an oyster sauce that caters to both dietary restrictions, so you'll need to DIY the sauce.

Mix equal parts gluten free soy sauce and gluten free hoisin sauce. This isn't exactly the same as oyster sauce, but it's pretty close.

\-------

# Our why

I've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.

Thanks for reading! Hope you all love the recipe :)",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kdsbhv/my_dads_perfect_chinese_broccoli_w_oyster_sauce/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kdsbhv/my_dads_perfect_chinese_broccoli_w_oyster_sauce/
k62cgr,Samosa Bowls,72,4,1607018295.0,0.95,Fruit\Vegetarian,TheGrumpyGarbanzo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/k62cgr,"# [Samosa Bowls](http://grumpygarbanzo.com/Meals/Samosa%20Bowls/)

Anything that's called a 'filling' is usually the best part of a food. Take cookie sandwiches for example: it's all about that (accidentally vegan) cream. And donuts? The jelly. Tacos? I think you get the idea.

It's the same story with samosas. Sure, we can appreciate the crispy, deep–fried goodness that normally surrounds a samosa. But are full–blown home–made samosas really feasible on an average weeknight? Unless you were taught by your grandma and know a wonton wrapper recipe by heart, probably not.

So, I present to you: the samosa bowl. This deconstructed samosa includes the key elements of potatoes, peas, and spices. Added chickpeas and rice boost the protein content and make the meal more filling. The lack of a fried wrapper makes the meal healthier and less dangerous; sharp, triangular foods are simply up to no good. Enjoy the flavors of a samosa from the comfort of your spoon.

# What:

brown rice

yellow potatoes

onion

garlic

pea

olive oil

garam masala

coriander

chili powder

fennel seed

ginger powder

# How:

Peel, chop, and boil potatoes until tender.

Heat oil in a pan over medium. Mix in spices generously and cook until fragrant.

Add chopped onion and minced garlic, cooking until soft.

Stir in chickpeas.

Once chickpeas are thoroughly coated in spices, add potatoes, peas, and stir.

Cook until well combined.

Serve over rice.

# What did I use and why?

I used frozen peas. They're convenient and, upon returning them to the freezer, I can forget about them until the next rare occasion that I actually want to cook with peas.

jzevyd,Sweet and tangy pineapple and cucumber pickle,1371,33,1606125390.0,0.98,Fruit\Vegetarian,miaowpitt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/jzevyd,"This is an old favourite. My mom use to make this, it’s called Acar Timun dan Nenas 🇲🇾. Some variations include carrot, and others use more vinegar and sugar but I find this ratio of vinegar to sugar the best since it doesn’t result in an overly watery Acar (pronounced Achar like Charmander). It’s fantastic on a very warm day. 

**Ingredients** (can be amended to suit your tastes)

* One cucumber. Roughly peel the cucumber so you get that lovely variation in green colour. Score lengthways with a fork. Slice lengthways once through the middle and then chop thinly. 
Realistically you can cut them up however you like but a thin slice is best imo.

* Half a small pineapple, chopped. 

* Half a red onion (or one shallot), sliced as thinly as possible. 

* One red chilli, thinly sliced. Or more if you like spicy stuff.

* Two tablespoons of white vinegar 

* Two teaspoons of white sugar 

* Half a teaspoon of salt 

**Directions**

Chop up ingredients. Mix in bowl thoroughly (very thoroughly) with vinegar, sugar and salt. Don’t add any water, there will be quite a bit of liquid from the pineapple and cucumber. Put in fridge for a bit, 30 mins or so. Eat.

Someone asked what this normally goes with. It’s usually a side to some white rice and spicy curry. The heat from the curry goes really well with the coolness of the pineapple and cucumber. Otherwise eat it from a bowl like I do.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/jzevyd/sweet_and_tangy_pineapple_and_cucumber_pickle/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/jzevyd/sweet_and_tangy_pineapple_and_cucumber_pickle/

Thank you all for the positive encouragement on my last post! I'm really enjoying making videos of what I cook. I'm sharing a miso fried rice recipe that I absolutely love.

A note about the rice – Ideally, you would use day old rice, but if you are craving fried rice RIGHT NOW, you can make the rice fresh. Just put it in the freezer for 15 minutes while you prep your ingredients! It will give you something close to day old rice. :)

Prep Time: 20 minutes

Cook Time: 20 minutes

Total Time: 40 minutes

Servings: 5

Calories: 409kcal

Equipment

* Large wok or wide pan

IngredientsSauce:

jibiav,Onigirazu with Okra &amp; Smoked Tofu,2610,37,1603704604.0,0.99,Fruit\Vegetarian,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/cajbgmjhrev51.jpg,"This Japanese sandwich made with seaweed and sushi rice instead of bread has a lot of potentials to become the superfood of tomorrow. What's interesting it first originated from Japanese manga ""Cooking Papa."" In the comic book, Papa is the guy working for corporation but a secretly amazing cook that lies to his colleagues telling them that all the outstanding food that he brings to work is made by his loving wife but she, in fact, is useless in the kitchen :)

It is super fun to make this and I love the delicate flavours that come through together!

📷📷

**Ingredients for 4 sandwiches:**

* 8 Sushi Nori Seaweed Square Sheets (Best way to buy in bulk on Amazon)
* 350g (12.3oz) of Sushi Rice cooked and seasoned
* 8 Ladyfingers - Okra, blanched in hot water for 1 minute
* 100g smoked tofu, pan-fried and glazed with soy sauce
* Mixed salad (beetroot, spinach)
* 1 Avocado sliced
* 1 small carrot  cut into matchsticks
* Half red pepper cut into matchsticks
* Japanese mayo
* Soy sauce
* Nigella seeds for garnish
* Plastic Wrap
* Small round dish or metal ring **(11.5cm in diameter and 5cm tall) (4,5 inch /2 inches)** to assemble (I used one of my small serving pie dishes and it worked great)

**Instructions for the small dish method:**

**1.** Cut a piece of plastic wrap bigger than a sheet of seaweed (It helps to hold everything in the shape) and place inside the dish.

**2.** Place a square of the seaweed inside the dish to fill its shape.

📷

**3.** Place a layer of rice at the bottom of the seaweed (use a small amount of water on your fingers to prevent the rice from sticking)

**4.** Create the mirror layers of your fillings with the main item in the middle finishing with rice layer at the top (push the layers down to compress and keep in mind where the cut will be) You can also drizzle some soy sauce inside the layers.

**5.** Remove from the dish by lifting the plastic wrap and cover the top with another piece of seaweed (big enough to overlap slightly on the previous seaweed)

**6.** Wrap tightly in the plastic wrap to hold the shape then cut.

**7.** Enjoy with a drizzle of Japanese Mayonaise!

 **Insight:**  


* I found it easier to work with seaweed that was soggier. Take a few sheets out the packet and leave them on the counter overnight.

How to Vegetarian Pumpkin Meatballs :

Ingredients

* 500 gr pumpkin
* 100 gr parmigiano
* 100 gr breadcrumbs
* 1 egg
* 60 gr assorted cheese
* 3 sage leaf
* salt &amp; Black pepper

**INSTRUCTION**

* Cut the mozzarella in slices of 1 cm thickness. Arrange them gradually on a tray lined with absorbent paper and cover with other sheets of paper towels.
* Cut 500 gr pumpkin in slices, remove the peel and put on a oven tray
* Season with olive oil and salt
* cook for 30 minutes at 140°
* mash the cooked pumpkin in a mixing bowl with a fork
* Add 100 gr parmigiano and 100 gr breadcrumbs
* add 1 egg, salt, pepper and 3 sage leaf finely cut
* make a ball with the dough and put in the fridge for 30 minutes
* Cut the mozzarella and the other cheese in small dices. This time i made these pumpkin meatball in three variations, mozzarella, cheddar or fontina cheese. For all the meatballs you will need a total of 60 gr of cheese
* take the dough in the fridge and form balls of about 40 gr inserting in the center some cubes of the chosen cheese.
* Close the meatball as to seal the cheese inside and work with your hands to give it a round shape.
* Don't make the meatball too big or the cheese inside will not melt from these doses you should get about 15 meatballs
* put every meatball in the breadcrumbs
* At this point, bring frying oil to a temperature of 140° and immerse the meatballs in oil for a couple of minutes, so that the cheese inside melts
* When they are golden brown, drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil

That's all! Like i said this recipe is very easy and remember : Eat while it's still hot!

* 1 teaspoon dry thyme plus more to taste
* 1 teaspoon dry chives plus more to taste
* 1 teaspoon dry parsley plus more to taste
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more, to taste
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Crispy Mushroom Topping:

* 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
* 8 ounces mushrooms torn or sliced, depending on variety
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley minced
* Flaky sea salt

### Instructions

#### Cook the Mushrooms:

* Heat oil and butter in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for 8-12 minutes, stirring often, until well-browned and softened. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl.

#### Cook the Mirepoix:

* If the pot is too dry, add another drizzle of oil. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook for 5-7 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds.
* Add the diced Roma tomatoes and the barley and cook for 1 minute, stirring regularly. Return the mushrooms to the pot and stir.

#### Add the Stock:

* Sprinkle the flour over the dish and stir to combine. Cook, stirring often, for 2-3 minutes until the flour deepens in color. Be careful not to burn the flour.
* Pour in 1 cup of stock and whisk to combine. Continue adding the stock, one cup at a time, whisking after each addition until all the stock is added. Season with chives, thyme, and parsley. Add the crushed red pepper and season again with salt and pepper to taste.
* Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 25-30 minutes until the barley is tender. Stir regularly and add up to 2 cups more stock if necessary. Taste and season again to preference.

#### Fry the Mushrooms:

* Once the stew is ready to serve, crisp up the mushroom topping.
* Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Once very hot, add the mushrooms and cook without moving for 2-3 minutes until very well browned. Flip and cook an additional 1-2 minutes until well-browned on the other side. Turn off the heat.
* Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl with freshly minced parsley and sprinkle immediately with flaky sea salt. Toss to coat with parsley.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the mushroom barley stew between bowls and pile the crispy mushrooms on top. Garnish with any remaining parsley. Enjoy!

### Notes

I used young, small carrots which did not need to be peeled. If using larger carrots, you only need 3 carrots. Peel them first.

Pinch of salt

1/2cup sugar

1 tbsp lemon zest (I used 4 tablespoons of lemon juice instead, came out fine)

2 tbsp baking powder

1/2 cup + 2 tbsp butter (1 stick plus 2 tbsp)

1 1/3 cups milk

1 cup blueberries

1 egg (for egg wash)

1 tbsp water (for egg wash)

For glaze, use 1 3/4 cups confectionery sugar, 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice, and 1 tbsp melted butter (mine are unglazed, personal preference)

Preheat oven to 400°F and grease a cookie sheet. Mix together flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and lemon zest (if substituting with lemon juice, wait until wet ingredients are added) (I also, for personal preference, added a generous dash of cinnamon). Grate cold/frozen butter into dry ingredients and combine. Add milk and blueberries (and lemon juice if used) and combine into dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and gently press the dough out into a 3/4"" thick layer. Cut or shape dough with cookie cutter, whatever is easier or preferred. Place the scones into the greased baking sheet with a bit of space in between each edge. Beat the egg/egg yolk and water together and brush onto the tops of the scones. If desired, sprinkle with sugar crystals. Let the dough rest for 15-20 minutes in a cool area, if necessary the scones can rest in the fridge. Once dough has rested, bake for 12-15 minutes or until tops are golden brown.

Method:

2. Add all the ingredients in a blender/food processer. The sliced bananas shouldn't form clumps or it will be difficult to blend. 
3. Add milk only to help blend the bananas, you can avoid it otherwise.

instructions

In a large skillet, or shallow  Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté, stirring often, until ten

der and golden, 5 minutes. Turn heat to medium, add your choice of veggies and garlic and ginger, and cook 4-5 minutes. Remove one cup of the mixture and set aside.

Add spices and bay leaf, and stir one minute, toasting the spices. Add basmati rice, and saute one-minute stirring. Add stock and salt.

Top with chickpeas, raisins and the cup of veggies you set aside. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then lower heat to low. Cover the pot with a thin dish towel, place the lid over the top of the towel, and bring the four corners of the towel up and over the lid.  This will tighten the seal and keep the steam in, allowing the rice to cook more quickly and evenly.

Simmer on low 20-30  minutes or until the rice has soaked up the liquid. See notes.

fs4qwr,Orange Cauliflower with Blood Orange,52,1,1585622039.0,0.98,Fruit\Vegetarian,StillHereArt,https://i.redd.it/mjzvg1qq6xp41.jpg,"Time: 60 Minutes – Makes about 4-6 FULL servings of Orange Cauliflower 

Ingredients: 

o  1 Whole Cauliflower

o  2 Tbsp Egg Substitute {I use Bob’s Red Mill Egg Replacer}

o  3/4 Cup Water

o  1 Cup Panko Breadcrumbs {I use Kikkoman}

o  1 Cup Gluten Free Bread crumbs {I use Schär Gluten Free}

o  1 Cup Panda Express Orange Sauce {sold in most super markets}

o  2 Tbsp Butter Substitute {I use Miyoko’s Vegan Butter}

o  2 Tbsp Sriracha

o  5 Whole Garlic Cloves {Minced}

o  3 Tbsp of Ginger {Minced}

o  1 Lime

o  Parchment Paper

o  Aluminum Foil 

Optional:

o  *Green Onion* 

o  *Cilantro*

o  *Pepper*

o  *Orange Slices*

Process:

1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees, and take out any large baking sheets you might have in there.

2.  Wash Cauliflower (WELL!)

3.  Cut into pieces the size of whatever you want to eat {I do chicken nugget size}.

4.  Combine Egg Substitute and Water in a bowl, to make the goo (wash) that will allow the Bread Crumbs stick to your Cauliflower, and let it sit for a minute.  You want the mixture to be similar to egg yolk consistency, so make sure it’s not too thick or thin.

5.  Lay a large piece of Parchment Paper on the counter, that will be big enough to hold all your Cauliflower.

6.  Once your Cauliflower pieces are dry, dip them in your Egg Substitute goo, shake off excess goo back into the bowl, and lay the Cauliflower pieces onto your Parchment Paper.  Once this is done, prepare your Bread Crumb Mixture.

7.  In a new bowl, combine 1 Cup Bread Crumbs &amp; 1 Cup Gluten Free Bread Crumbs, and mix around a little bit to ensure even dispersal.  \*NOTE – you can use just Panko Bread Crumbs, or just Gluten Free Bread Crumbs, I just like to mix them together.

8.  Get two large baking sheets, and cover them with Aluminum Foil.

9.  Take your Cauliflower with the goo on it and, one at a time, drop them into your Bread Crumbs, shifting them around gently as to coat them completely.  Once completely coated, place them gently on your Aluminum Foil baking sheet.  Don’t stack them, as that will cause them to cook unevenly.

10.  Place your Breaded Cauliflower into the oven, and cook them for 12 minutes on each side, flipping them halfway through.  You can cook them longer if you need, but be careful not to turn up the temperature, otherwise they will burn easily.  

11.  While your Cauliflower is baking, start preparing the sauce in a large pan (nonstick preferably).  

12.  Add the Butter and Garlic to the pan, cooking on Medium-Low heat, for about 5 minutes, making sure the garlic doesn’t burn.  Then add the Panda Express Orange Sauce, as well as the Sriracha and Ginger.  

13.  Bring the sauce to a Low Simmer, and let sit until the Cauliflower is done baking.

14.  Once the Cauliflower is done, take it out of the oven, transfer it a large mixing bowl, and cover it with your delicious Orange Sauce. 

15.  Squeeze a Lime over it, and add the optional Pepper, Green Onion, and Cilantro if you want.  Mix it around a little bit, add Blood Orange Slices if you want to make it juicy and fancy, and then eat it while looking out your window at people who have no idea how amazing of a chef you are!",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fs4qwr/orange_cauliflower_with_blood_orange/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fs4qwr/orange_cauliflower_with_blood_orange/

Allergens: coconut, tree nuts


INSTRUCTIONS

1

 

Cook the rice

Combine the brown rice, 1¼ cups water, and a pinch of salt in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and cook rice, covered, until all of the water is absorbed, about 30 to 35 minutes.

2

 

Prepare the vegetables

Peel and small dice the onion. Peel the mango, carefully slice the flesh off the seed, and then dice.

3

 

Simmer the curry sauce

Place a medium saucepan over medium heat with 2 tsp vegetable oil. Add half the onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add the curry powder, garam masala, and tomato paste, and cook for 1 minute. Add the coconut milk and ¼ cup water, and bring sauce to a simmer. Cook until slightly thickened, about 5 to 7 minutes.

INGREDIENTS

FOR THE DOSA BATTER:

2 cups short-grain rice

½ cup urad dal (split husked black lentils)

1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds

½ teaspoon salt

 Vegetable oil, for frying

FOR THE POTATO FILLING:

3 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil

1 teaspoon mustard seeds

½ teaspoon cumin seeds

2 small dried hot red peppers

1 medium onion, diced

½ teaspoon salt

½ teaspoon turmeric

 Pinch of asafetida

1 tablespoon grated ginger

6 to 8 curry leaves
4 garlic cloves minced

2 small green chiles, finely chopped

1 ½ pounds yellow-fleshed potatoes, such as Yukon Gold, boiled, peeled and cubed

½ cup roughly chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems

Make the dosa batter: Put rice in a bowl, rinse well and cover with 4 cups cold water. Put urad dal and fenugreek seeds in a small bowl, rinse well and add cold water to cover. Leave both to soak for 4 to 6 hours.

Drain rice and dal-fenugreek mixture in separate colanders. Put rice in a food processor, blender or wet-dry grinder. Add 1 cup cold water and grind to a smooth paste. It will take about 10 minutes, and it may be necessary to work in batches. Repeat the process with the dal-fenugreek mixture.

Combine the two pastes in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk together, adding enough water to obtain a medium-thick batter. You should have about 6 cups. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel and set in a warm place. Let ferment until the surface is bubbly, about 8 hours. Stir in the salt. Use the batter straight away or refrigerate for later use. (Batter will keep for up to a week, refrigerated. Thin with water if necessary before proceeding.)

Make the potato filling: Put ghee in a wide skillet over medium heat. When oil is wavy, add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Wait for seeds to pop, about 1 minute, then add red peppers and onion. Cook, stirring until onions have softened, about 5 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Add turmeric, asafetida, ginger, curry leaves, garlic and green chile. Stir to coat and let sizzle for 1 minute.

Add potatoes and 1/2 cup water. Cook, stirring well to combine, until liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Mash potatoes a bit with the back of a wooden spoon. Season well with salt, add cilantro, then set aside at room temperature. (Potato filling may be prepared up to a day in advance.)

To make dosas, set a griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Brush with about 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Ladle 1/4 cup batter in the center of griddle. Using bottom of ladle, quickly spread batter outward in a circular motion to a diameter of about 7 inches. Drizzle 1/2 teaspoon oil over the top. Leave dosa batter to brown gradually until outer edges begin to look dry, about 2 minutes, cooking on one side only. With a spatula, carefully loosen dosa from griddle. Bottom should be crisp and beautifully browned. Spoon 1/2 cup potato filling onto top of dosa, centering it as a strip in the middle of the round dosa. Flatten the potato mixture slightly. Using the spatula, fold the sides of the dosa around the filling to make a cylindrical shape. Serve immediately. Continue making dosas one at a time.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fmurd6/classic_massala_dosa/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/fmurd6/classic_massala_dosa/

en3lrp,Roasted veggies + Grilling cheese,20,1,1578721721.0,0.93,Fruit\Vegetarian,Sirenemon,https://i.redd.it/pep8fj6n83a41.jpg,"This is adapted from Hello Fresh's ""veggie jumble"" which is kind of a dumb name. It's a very malleable recipe and I've made it a bunch of times with different combos of things

**Ingredients**

* Sweet potato(es)
* Bell pepper
* Red onion
* Grilling cheese (sometimes called halloumi)
* EVOO, salt/pepper, whatever spices/acids/herbs you like!

**Directions**

1. Set oven to 425 with rack in the middle. Put some tin foil on a rimmed cookie/baking sheet for easy cleanup
2. Cut veggies into bite-size pieces: 1/2"" cubes, slices, wedges etc
3. Place veggies on baking sheet. Drizzle on a few tablespoons of oil (EVOO yummy) and season. Tonight I used kosher salt, fresh cracked black pepper, oregano, chili flakes and some balsamic vinegar. Toss so everything is seasoned well and spread out so stuff is in a single layer (onion can be ""connected"" as wedges if you like)
4. Cook in the oven for \~25 minutes. If you want to make a tasy sauce/dressing like chimmichurri to toss it in you can make that now or just chill for a bit.
5. Once veggies are done put them in a medium or large bowl and season again. I put in a little more oil (&lt;1 T) and Secret Aardvark habanero sauce, as well as juice from half a lemon. You can also do a vinegar (maybe the balsamic would have been better to do here), citrus zest, dressing/vinaigrette....
6. If you like, you can add some veggies you don't want/need to cook now. I put in some grape tomatoes and chopped cilantro but I've added diced avocado before (which is yummy but not fun if you want leftovers for lunch)
7. Take a small skillet and heat a tablespoon or two of oil in it. Slice your grilling cheese, about 1/2"" thick. Once the oil is hot place the cheese and watch it. Flip it when the bottoms are cooked, which would be it's melted at least halfway up and the bottoms are getting brown/crispy. Should only take a few minutes. The pieces might touch each other and melt together a little and make it less photogenic.
8. Arrange on a plate or bowl, add Tabasco if you'd like

**Notes**

* Roast whatever veggies are roast-able. Try other kinds of peppers, regular potatoes, I bet Brussel sprouts could be pretty good, too. I always use sweet potatoes since it's so good
* Adjust ratios of veggies and cheese based on your preferences or what you have on hand. I'm not super into onions so I used 2 small sweet potatoes, 1 bell pepper and 1/2 red onion
* This is just a vehicle to eat a bunch of veggies. I really like roasted veggies but you could make certain things raw instead if that's what you're into. I really cannot stand raw onions so roasting them works well. Things you don't roast like tomatoes or avocado will warm up when it's hanging out in the bowl
* I have to go to a specialty grocery store for the grilling cheese. Trader Joe's used to have it but not for awhile now. You can use other proteins like tofu, chicken etc if you want but grilling cheese is really good!!! You should try it out!
* You can make a big batch of veggies and have it as lunch the next day. It works good both cold and microwaved",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/en3lrp/roasted_veggies_grilling_cheese/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/en3lrp/roasted_veggies_grilling_cheese/

Ingredients

* 1 large cucumber (about 375 g)
* 3 small tomatoes (160 g)
* 1/2 cup water (125 mL)
* 5 cups whole wheat flour (565 g)
* 2 1/2 tsp active dry yeast (9 g)
* 1 1/2 tsp salt (9 g)
* assorted dried herbs (optional; leave out for a more neutral-tasting bread)

Instructions

1. Puree cucumber and tomatoes with 1/2 cup water, and any dried herbs if desired. (I used a dash each of marjoram, parsley, and savory, though next time I would leave the savory out and add thyme and rosemary instead. I would have used dill but we didn’t have any.)
1. Add flour, yeast, and salt, to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, and turn on briefly to mix.
1. Pour the cucumber mixture into the bowl, and run the mixer on Speed 2 for at least five minutes or until well incorporated, with no dry spots of flour left. You may have to pause to scrape the bowl or stir it manually to help things along. Add more water, 1/4 cup at a time, if it looks dry. The mixture should be quite wet, kind of like a no-knead dough.
1. Cover and leave to rise for 2–4 hours. I think I rested it for 3 hours? Not too sure of the exact time, but basically let it sit until it’s grown to roughly 1.5× in size. It ferments quite slowly due to the acidity of the tomatoes.
1. Scoop or pour the mixture into two small loaf pans, or one large one. It won’t rise too much in the oven, so feel free to pour it 3/4 full. Transfer to a cold oven and let rise again for about 30 minutes, or until it’s reached close to the top of the pan.
1. With loaves inside the oven, preheat to 400 °F and set a timer for 40 minutes. After 40 minutes, check every 10 minutes until crust is browned to your liking.
1. Cool completely before slicing.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ef3bh3/cucumber_tomato_whole_wheat_bread/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/ef3bh3/cucumber_tomato_whole_wheat_bread/

&amp;#x200B;

 

### Ingredients

#### Filling

* 6 medium apples peeled, cored and cut into small pieces
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
* ⅓ packed cup brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* ⅛ teaspoon kosher salt

#### Topping

* 1 ¼ cup old fashioned oats
* 2 tablespoons AP flour
* 5 tablespoons cold unsalted butter
* ⅓ cup brown sugar
* ⅛ teaspoon kosher salt
* Sprinkle of ground cinnamon

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 F.
2. Ensure apples are washed, peeled, cored and cut into bite sized pieces and put into a large mixing bowl.
3. Place 10 inch cast iron skillet over medium low heat and melt the butter for the filling.
4. Once the butter is melted, whisk in brown sugar, cinnamon and salt.
5. Pour the butter mixture into the mixing bowl containing the apples and toss until apples are coated.
6. Add the apples and butter back into the skillet and turn the heat up to medium. Continuously stir while it cooks for 5 minutes, until apples begin to soften. Remove the pan from the heat, but keep the apple mixture in it.
7. After the apples are partially cooked, cut the 5 tablespoons of butter into 5 separate pieces.
8. Except the ground cinnamon, mix all topping ingredients together in a medium mixing bowl. It is easiest to combine with a pastry cutter or hands. It is okay to have small lumps of butter throughout the mixture.
9. Top the apples in the skillet with the topping evenly and place in the oven. Sprinkle cinnamon on top.
10. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until apples are tender and topping is crunchy.

### Notes

INGREDIENTS

2 tablespoons Ghee

1 Bay Leaf

1 Star Anise

4 Whole Cardamom

4 Cloves

1 inch piece Cinnamon Stick

1/2 teaspoon Caraway Seeds (Shahjeera)

2 Green Chillies, slit lengthwise

1 large Onion, sliced or chopped

1 teaspoon Red Chili Powder or Paprika

1/2 teaspoon Garam Masala

1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons Salt

2 1/2 cups Water

INSTRUCTIONS

Saute: Turn on the Instant Pot and switch on ‘saute function’. Heat ghee in the pot and add all the whole spices (bay leaf, star anise, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and caraway seeds). Saute for a minute till fragrant and add green chillies, onions and ginger. Drain the water from the rice and add it to the pot. Toast the rice for 2-3 minutes till it smells nutty.

Cook in the Instant Pot: Add the remaining ingredients (veggies, spices, salt and water), mix well and lock the lid in place. Turn the knob to sealing, and select ‘manual’ for 8 minutes at high pressure. Once the timer goes off, let pressure release naturally for five minutes and then release the remaining pressure manually. Top with crispy fried onions and enjoy.

Cook in a traditional pressure cooker: To cook in a traditional pressure cooker, follow the instructions as is, and cook on high heat for two whistles. Let the pressure release naturally. Top with crispy fried onions and enjoy.

NOTES

Serving Suggestions for Veg Pulao: Veg pulao tastes best with cucumber raita, but it’s a great side dish and goes well with pretty much anything including grilled chicken, curries and dal.

Quality of Rice: Long grain, good quality aged basmati rice is best in this recipe. I’ve never tried this with short grained rice.

Salt: I’ve given a range for the amount of salt you need in this recipe, because it changes based on taste. Start with 1 tablespoon and taste once cooked and then adjust if you need.

Gather all your ingredients. You will need blanched almonds for the chutney so soak the almonds in water for an hour or so and then peel off their skin. I found ready to use tamarind paste at the Indian store.

In a blender add all the ingredients together – chopped coriander leaves, chopped onion, red chilli powder, almonds, cashews, salt, sugar and tamarind paste.

Blend to get a smooth paste. Taste the chutney and adjust the sweetness/sourness accordingly. For a sweeter chutney add little more sugar. For more sourness add more of tamarind paste.

FOR THE DOSA BATTER:

2 cups short-grain rice

½ cup urad dal (split husked black lentils)

1 teaspoon fenugreek seeds

½ teaspoon salt

 Vegetable oil, for frying

FOR THE POTATO FILLING:

3 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil

2 small dried hot red peppers

1 medium onion, diced

½ teaspoon salt

4 garlic cloves, minced

2 small green chiles, finely chopped

1 ½ pounds yellow-fleshed potatoes, such as Yukon Gold, boiled, peeled and cubed

½ cup roughly chopped cilantro, leaves and tender stems

Email Grocery List

PREPARATION

Make the dosa batter: Put rice in a bowl, rinse well and cover with 4 cups cold water. Put urad dal and fenugreek seeds in a small bowl, rinse well and add cold water to cover. Leave both to soak for 4 to 6 hours.

Drain rice and dal-fenugreek mixture in separate colanders. Put rice in a food processor, blender or wet-dry grinder. Add 1 cup cold water and grind to a smooth paste. It will take about 10 minutes, and it may be necessary to work in batches. Repeat the process with the dal-fenugreek mixture.

Combine the two pastes in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk together, adding enough water to obtain a medium-thick batter. You should have about 6 cups. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel and set in a warm place. Let ferment until the surface is bubbly, about 8 hours. Stir in the salt. Use the batter straight away or refrigerate for later use. (Batter will keep for up to a week, refrigerated. Thin with water if necessary before proceeding.)

Make the potato filling: Put ghee in a wide skillet over medium heat. When oil is wavy, add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Wait for seeds to pop, about 1 minute, then add red peppers and onion. Cook, stirring until onions have softened, about 5 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Add turmeric, asafetida, ginger, curry leaves, garlic and green chile. Stir to coat and let sizzle for 1 minute.

Add potatoes and 1/2 cup water. Cook, stirring well to combine, until liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Mash potatoes a bit with the back of a wooden spoon. Season well with salt, add cilantro, then set aside at room temperature. (Potato filling may be prepared up to a day in advance.)

To make dosas, set a griddle or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Brush with about 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Ladle 1/4 cup batter in the center of griddle. Using bottom of ladle, quickly spread batter outward in a circular motion to a diameter of about 7 inches. Drizzle 1/2 teaspoon oil over the top. Leave dosa batter to brown gradually until outer edges begin to look dry, about 2 minutes, cooking on one side only. With a spatula, carefully loosen dosa from griddle. Bottom should be crisp and beautifully browned. Spoon 1/2 cup potato filling onto top of dosa, centering it as a strip in the middle of the round dosa. Flatten the potato mixture slightly. Using the spatula, fold the sides of the dosa around the filling to make a cylindrical shape. Serve immediately.

## Directions

&amp;#x200B;

### Roasting

&amp;#x200B;

1. Clean the butternut squash and slice it in half. Remove the seeds — you can keep these for later roasting.
2. Place both halves on a baking tray with the open side up, the meat is exposed.
3. Spread the oil across the squash.
4. Sprinkle the salt and rosemary over the squash.
5. Roast at 200°C for 30Minute, until a fork goes easily through the fleshy part.
6. Remove the tray from the oven.

&amp;#x200B;

### Soy Stuffing

&amp;#x200B;

1. Add the water and soy mince to a small pot.
2. Bring the pot to a boil and turn off the heat.
3. Let it stand for at least 5 minutes.
4. Strain the soy and dump it into a large mixing bowl.

&amp;#x200B;

### Fry Stuffing

&amp;#x200B;

1. Place about half of the coconut oil into a frying pan and bring it to maximum heat.
2. Add the sliced onions to the frying pan.
3. Fry until they are slightly browned or translucent, about 5 minutes.  Dump the onions into the large mixing bowl with the soy mince.
4. Add the chopped celery to the pan along with the remaining coconut oil.
5. Fry until the celery is slightly softer and translucent, about 5 minutes. Dump the celery into the mixing bowl.
6. Add the diced tomatoes to the pan. Let them fry for 5-10 minutes. You can turn the heat off after 5 minutes.
7. Dump the tomatoes into the mixing bowl.

&amp;#x200B;

### Mixing

&amp;#x200B;

1. Using a spoon, scoop out the insides of the butternut squash. Leave a bit on the edges so it does not fall apart.
2. If some of the squash is a bit harder, then scrape it out with the spoon, or cut it out with a knife.
3. If you have harder pieces, dice them and fry them for 5-10 minutes  until a bit softer. You may also fry some of the softer meat for a  flavour variation.
4. Dump the squash into the mixing bowl.
5. Add the spices, the coriander, chili, pepper and salt to the mixing bowl.
6. Mix all the ingredients thoroughly.

&amp;#x200B;

### Stuff

&amp;#x200B;

1. Fill the squash halves with the stuffing. You will need to pack it tightly so it fits. Put any extra into an oven safe dish.
2. Roast the squash, top-heat at 200°C, for 10-20 minutes.
3. If you’ve prepared this  in advance and the ingredients have cooled,  turn the heat down to 100°C after 10 minutes and let it warm longer.
4. Serve the squash. The skin may be eaten, but need not be.",https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/csv234/celery_and_soy_stuffed_butternut_squash/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/csv234/celery_and_soy_stuffed_butternut_squash/
