19d0wfc,Buffalo Chicken Tenders,202,12,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Buffalo Chicken Tenders**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/buffalo-chicken-tenders/)

I use Frank's, but you can use your favorite cayenne-based hot sauce, or like my dad...you can make a little wing sauce concoction of all your favorite random hot sauces in your fridge.

**Ingredients:**

* 1¼  pounds chicken tenderloins
* ½ cup flour
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons Frank’s RedHot Original Hot Sauce, or use your favorite cayenne-based hot sauce
* 2 cups panko
* 4 scallions, trimmed and minced
* Neutral oil, for frying
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the chicken:**

1. Pat the chicken tenderloins dry and season with salt and pepper.

**Set up your dredging station:**

1. Set out three shallow dishes. To the first dish, add flour, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and a pinch of salt. To the second dish, add 2 eggs plus 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and whisk until smooth. Add panko with a pinch of salt and pepper to the third dish.

**Preheat the oil:**

1. Add about ¼ inch of neutral oil to a wide pot or skillet. You only need enough oil to come up to half the thickness of a chicken tender. Turn the heat to medium-low to preheat the oil.

**Dredge the chicken:**

1. Dip a chicken tenderloin into the flour and shake off the excess. Next, dip it into the egg mixture and shake off the excess. Finish dredging the chicken by rolling it gently in the panko; gently press it into the tender to ensure it adheres. Transfer to a baking rack. Continue until all tenders are dredged.

**Heat the sauce:**

1. Simmer the remaining 1 cup of hot sauce over low heat as you fry the chicken tenders.

**Fry the chicken tenders:**

1. Turn the heat on the oil to medium. If you drop a piece of panko into the pot, it should bubble and sizzle but not overly vigorously. You can use a meat thermometer to ensure it is 350ºF.
2. Once the oil is hot, fry the chicken tenders in batches, about 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown. Once the tenders reach 165ºF, transfer them to a cooling rack or paper towel-lined plate.

**Sauce the tenders:**

1. Once all the chicken tenders are fried, pour the warm sauce into a large bowl.
2. Add the chicken tenders to the bowl in batches and toss gently to coat in the sauce.

**To serve:**

1. Transfer the sauced tenders to a serving platter and sprinkle with minced scallions.

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/](https://maplewoodroad.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/)

**INGREDIENTS**  
***Cinnamon Roll Dough***

* 1 cup warm milk (not hot)
* 2-½ teaspoons instant yeast
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* ¼ cup butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 cups all purpose flour

***Filling***

* ¾ cup light brown sugar, packed
* 2 tablespoons cinnamon
* ½ cup butter, softened

***Icing***

* 6 ounces cream cheese, softened
* 1-½ cups powdered sugar
* ⅓ cup butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  


**INSTRUCTIONS**  
***Making the Dough***

1. Place warm milk in a mixing bowl, add yeast, and give it a stir. Let it sit for a minute or two while you’re gathering your other ingredients. 
2. Next, add sugar, eggs, butter, salt, and vanilla, and mix well. Lastly, using a dough hook, add flour and mix until it forms a firm yet tacky dough that pulls away from the edges. Resist adding more flour…the dough should be slightly tacky.
3. Remove dough from the mixer and knead by hand, on a lightly floured surface, for 5 minutes (yes, even if you used a stand mixer).

***First Rising***

1. Grease a large bowl with butter or cooking spray. Place the dough in this bowl, cover with a warm towel, and let sit in a warm spot for 1 to 1-½ hours or until it doubles in size.

***Cinnamon Roll Filling***

1. In a bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until it resembles a paste.

***Rolling out the dough, adding filling, and cutting into shape***

1. For this step, I used silicone baking mats, but you can also roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring approximately 22” x 14”.
2. Drop some of the cinnamon roll filling here and there over the rolled out dough. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently spread the filling all over the dough, keeping away from the edges by about a quarter inch.
3. Starting at a short end (one of the 14” ends), gently but tightly roll the dough into one long roll.
4. Using a sharp knife (I found that a serrated knife worked best), cut the roll into 12 evenly sliced pieces. 

***Second Rising***

1. Preheat oven to 350℉.
2. Place the cut cinnamon rolls into a parchment-lined baking dish, three rows of four.
3. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes, or until they’ve nearly doubled in size.

***Baking Cinnamon Rolls***

1. Remove the plastic wrap and place baking pan in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 20 – 30 minutes. My cinnamon rolls took 30 minutes to bake, but you should start checking on them after 20 minutes. All ovens are different. The cinnamon rolls will be done when the tops have just lightly browned and the dough sounds hollow when you lightly tap on it with a spoon. The rolls will rise even more while they’re baking and will most likely touch each other. This is fine and good…they’ll stay soft in the middle.

***Icing for Cinnamon Rolls***

1. While the rolls are baking, make the icing. Using either a stand mixer or handheld mixer, blend together cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla until smooth. 
2. When the cinnamon rolls are done baking, let them cool about 5 minutes and add icing to the tops, so it will slightly melt and ooze between the swirls. If you prefer the icing thicker on top, wait until they’ve fully cooled.",1704476711000,0.9599609375,Recipe,pangibear,https://i.redd.it/7uef78dbsnac1.jpeg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18zcqmd/cinnamon_rolls/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18zcqmd/cinnamon_rolls/,Cinnamon rolls,415.0,0.9,18.0,24.0,11.0,55.0,8.0,2.0,0.8400000000000001
18vf164,Mushroom-Taleggio Risotto,184,6,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Mushroom-Taleggio Risotto Recipe**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/mushroom-taleggio-risotto-recipe/)

* .5 ounces dry porcini mushrooms
* 1 cup boiling water
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 leek, white and light green part only; trimmed, scrubbed thoroughly, and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 1 cup arborio rice
* 5–6 cups warm water or vegetable stock, more or less as needed
* 4 ounces Taleggio cheese, rind removed
* ½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
* 2 tablespoons finely minced parsley
* 1 lemon, juiced
* Sweet pea tendrils, optional, for serving
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the porcini mushrooms:**

1. Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl. Pour 1 cup boiling water over the mushrooms and soak for 20 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the water and finely chop them. Reserve the soaking liquid for the risotto.

**Fry the cremini mushrooms:**

1. Place a large pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium. Add the sliced cremini mushrooms to the dry pot and cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes. The mushrooms will release water and begin to dry out.
2. Once all the liquid evaporates from the pot, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 8–10 minutes more, turning regularly, until browned and crisp. Season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the leek:**

1. Add the leek and chopped porcini mushrooms to the pot. Cook, turning occasionally, for 5 minutes until the leek softens.

**Toast the rice:**

1. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot. Add the rice and cook for 2–3 minutes until it begins to toast. Season with salt and pepper.

**Begin adding liquid:**

1. Add the porcini soaking liquid and stir to incorporate and lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring periodically until the rice absorbs all the liquid.
2. Add warm water or vegetable stock in ladleful increments, stirring after each addition and adding more liquid once the rice absorbs what’s in the pot. Stir occasionally, but not constantly. You may need to adjust the heat between medium and medium-low to prevent the risotto from sticking.
3. After 20–25 minutes, the rice should be tender and the liquid creamy. You may need 4–5 cups of liquid, give or take. Taste and add more salt and pepper.

**Finish the risotto:**

1. Turn the heat to low. Add the Taleggio cheese and stir to incorporate. Continue stirring until the cheese melts completely. Add the Parmesan cheese, minced parsley, and lemon juice. Simmer for 2–3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Taste and season, and let the risotto stand for 5 minutes.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the risotto into a large serving bowl. Garnish with sweet pea tendrils and a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese if you like.

* 3½ pound chicken, neck and giblets reserved for another use
* 4 sprigs of thyme
* 1 shallot, peeled and quartered
* 3 ribs celery, trimmed and cut into thirds
* 3½ teaspoons of salt, plus more if needed

**Soup:**

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

* 2 teaspoons minced ginger
* 2 teaspoons turmeric
* 1½ cups dry red lentils, picked over and rinsed
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 1 lemon, juiced
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the broth:**

1. Place the chicken in a large stockpot with thyme, shallot, and celery. Cover the chicken with about 12 cups of water; use enough to fully submerge it. Add 3½ teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 2 hours until the chicken is fully cooked.

**Shred the chicken:**

1. Turn the heat off. Using tongs, carefully transfer the chicken into a large bowl. Pick the meat from the bones once the chicken is cool enough to handle. You can add the skin to the soup if you like or discard it. Reserve the carcass for stock if you like.
2. Strain the broth into a large bowl through a fine mesh sieve. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop. Discard the spent broth aromatics.

**Make the soup:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook for 8–10 minutes. Season with salt. Add the garlic and scallion whites and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
2. Add the ginger and turmeric and toss to coat. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the lentils and cook for 1 minute. Add a big pinch of salt.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Pour in the reserved broth–you should have about 8–10 cups. Add the shredded chicken and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes until the lentils are tender. Taste and add crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper to taste. Stir in half the minced scallion greens and the lemon juice. Simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 duck breast
* 350 gram sweet potato
* 100 gram spinach
* 100 gram mushrooms (I used Shimei)
* 10 leaves of sage
* 1 shallot
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 100-gram cold butter
* a splash of cream (around 1 tbsp)
* 200 ml port wine (ruby or tawny)
* 200 ml chicken (or poultry) stock
* olive oil for pan-frying

**Directions:**

1. First of all, try to remove your duck breast from the fridge 1 hour before you start cooking to make sure it will be at room temperature when you pan-sear the duck. Then peel your sweet potatoes and cut them into even-sized cubes. Add to a pan, together with 75 ml of water, 50 grams of butter, and a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a simmer and turn low. Let this simmer for about 25 minutes.
2. In the meantime, it is time to prepare the sauce. Finely chop the shallot and saute for 2 minutes on medium heat. Add your stock and port wine and reduce by half or until the reduction thickens. Set this aside, clean your mushrooms and finely chop your garlic. Heat your frying pan and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Fry your sage leaves in the oil for about 20-30 seconds or until crispy and put them on a piece of kitchen paper. 
3. Now we are getting there! Preheat your oven to 160 degrees Celsius. Score the fat side of the duck breast (but not too deep) and add it to the already hot pan with the fat side down. Make sure your pan is on medium heat and let the fat render for about 5 minutes or until evenly golden and crispy. Then turn over the duck breast, add a small knob of butter to the pan, and baste your duck for two more minutes. Now add this to an oven dish and continue cooking for about 8 more minutes or until a core temperature of 53 degrees Celsius. 
4. In the meantime, we fry our mushrooms with half of the garlic and a bit of olive oil until nicely golden, add them to an ovenproof dish, and put them in the oven next to the duck. Now add some olive oil the rest of the garlic and your spinach to the pan. Saute until it is fragrant and welted down and set aside. Now you mash your sweet potatoes with a tbsp of cream and salt and pepper to taste. Since we used only a little bit of water, we didn't have to drain them before mashing them to create the ultimate texture and flavor. reheat your port reduction and cut off the heat again, add 50 grams of cold butter and combine with a whisk. 
5. After your duck hits 53 degrees Celsius you let it rest on your counter for about 10 minutes and then we are ready to plate the dish. Start with a layer of your potato puree and add the spinach and mushrooms on top. Slice your duck into 6 pieces and add 3 pieces to both plates (like in the picture). Finish with the sauce and crispy sage leaves and your dish is finished.

\* 1.3 cups Bomba Rice - (250g) Spanish Paella Rice

\* 2 Bell Peppers - small dice

\* White mushrooms - (200g) sliced

\* 2 Onions, medium size - small dice

\* 3 Garlic cloves - minced

\* 2.5 cups Vegetable Stock - (600ml)

\* 4 Ripe tomatoes, medium size - cut into wedges

\* 1 tbsp Paprika - Use Hungarian Sheged for best quality

\* 1 tsp Turmeric

\* 1 tsp Ground cumin

\* 1 pinch Saffron

\* 1 Lime - juice only

\* 1 handful Parsley - (optional for garnish)

\* 2 tbsp Olive oil - for frying (no need if chorizo releases a lot of fat)

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

1. In a large paella pan or a wide frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over high heat. Add chorizo slices and fry until they start to crisp, about 3-5 minutes. Keep the chorizo in the pan.
2. Reduce the heat to medium and add onions to the pan with chorizo and cook for about 5 minutes until they become translucent. Then add bell peppers and mushrooms, cooking until they soften, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
3. Add the Bomba rice to the pan, stirring to ensure it's well coated with the oils and juices.Cook the rice for about 2 minutes until it starts to become translucent. Stir in paprika, turmeric, ground cumin, and a pinch of saffron.
4. Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Let it simmer gently for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to evenly distribute the heat.
5. Add the tomato wedges and nestle the king prawns into the rice. Continue to cook for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and cooked through, and the rice is tender. You can cover the pan at this stage with a lid and do not stir it to develop delicious soccarat.
6. Remove the pan from the heat. Squeeze in the juice of one lime and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan back with a lid and let it rest for 5 minutes.
7. Sprinkle the paella with chopped parsley for a fresh finish. Serve directly from the pan, ensuring each portion includes some of the delicious socarrat (caramelized and slightly crispy layer of rice that forms at the bottom of the pan)

**Stock (optional to make; can use chicken broth instead):**

* 1 turkey carcass
* Water
* Salt

**Soup:**

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 carrots, peeled and diced
* 4 ribs celery, trimmed and diced
* 1 fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 5 sprigs thyme, bundled together with kitchen twine
* 6-7 cups prepared stock from above or use chicken broth
* 4 cups chopped or shredded leftover turkey; use in addition to any meat you pull off the turkey carcass
* ¾ cup pastina or ditalini
* 1 lemon, juiced
* ½ cup fresh parsley, minced
* Big pinch of fennel fronds, minced
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* Salt and pepper

**Make the stock:**

1. Place the turkey carcass in a large stockpot and cover with 12 cups water. You may need more depending on the size of the carcass. Try your best to immerse the bird with water, but if your pot isn’t big enough, it’s ok if the back bone sticks out a bit. Add a big pinch of salt to the water.
2. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 2-3 hours. You may wish to flip the bird once during simmering. The liquid should reduce by almost half.
3. Cover the pot (with foil, if the turkey is sticking out) and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.
4. The next day, remove the carcass from the stock. Pick off any remaining meat and set it aside in a bowl to be added to the soup. Discard the carcass.
5. If the stock is very gelatinous, place it on the heat over medium-high just until the gelatin melts, and the stock returns to a liquid. Turn off the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve.
6. Give the pot a quick rinse and wipe it out. Return it to the stovetop.

**Cook the soup aromatics:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for 8-10 minutes.
2. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the bundle of thyme.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Pour in the prepared stock and the chopped turkey. Add salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove and discard the thyme.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Return the soup to a boil. Add the pastina and cook for 3-4 minutes. Taste and add salt and pepper.
2. Finish the soup by adding parsley, fennel fronds, and lemon juice.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with lemon wedges and minced parsley on the side.

* 50 gram carrot
* 100 gram pointed cabbage
* 150 gram leek
* ½ tsp turmeric powder
* 2 tsp cumin powder
* 1 tsp cilantro powder
* 50 gram ginger (grated), or 1 tsp ginger powder
* 2 tbsp neutral oil
* 1 onion
* small bunch (10g) of celery leaf
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 3 tbsp Kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce)**optional:**
* 1 tbsp sambal to taste (Indonesian chilli sauce)
* 1 tsp trassi (fermented shrimp paste)**Condiments to serve:**
* Prawn crackers
* Atjar tjampoer (mixed pickled vegetable)
* Sambal (Indonesian chilli sauce)
* 4 eggs, sunny side up 
* Sliced cucumber 

**Directions:**

1. Cook your rice a minute shorter than what the packaging states. If using freshly cooked rice, spread it out on a tray to cool slightly. If you are using leftover rice - that's even better - break up any clumps.
2. Cut the leek in half and slice into rings of 1 cm. Dice the carrot, and cut the pointed cabbage and onion. If you use other vegetables, or left-over vegetables, cut them in bite-sized pieces as well. You can basically use any vegetable you like.
3. Gather the spices: turmeric, ginger, cilantro, cumin, garlic. Chop the shrimp paste, this is optionally. And grab your sambal.
4. Heat a large pan or wok over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of neutral oil and sauté the onion until fragrant and translucent.
5. Turn your wok down to low heat. Add the spices, the shrimp paste and the sambal to the wok. If using sambal, adjust the amount according to your desired level of spiciness. Wok for 3 minutes.
6. Add the vegetables to the wok. Heat your wok over medium heat. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened.
7. Add 1/3 of the cooked rice to the wok. And then add the kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce). Use a spatula to break up any clumps and mix the rice with the vegetables and spices.
8. Add the other 2/3 of the cooked rice and the chopped celery leaves. Continue stir-frying the rice for about 5 more minutes until all the rice has turned brown and yellowish. Optionally you can now make a sunny side up egg in another pan. I really like a sunny side up egg as a condiment to this nasi goreng recipe. 
9. Remove your nasi goreng from heat and serve on the plate with condiments such as: prawn crackers, store-bought atjar tjampoer (mixed pickled vegetables), sambal (Indonesian chili sauce), and your sunny side up egg.Selamat makan! (Enjoy your meal)

1813o0j,My family’s apple pie recipe,927,71,"Formatted recipe:




One crust: (double for 2-crust pie)

- 1 stick of butter
- 3 1/2 tbsp ice water
- 2 1/4 cu flour
- 1/4 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt

1. Cut butter into flour/salt/baking powder mixture, which has been whisked together.

2. Dough should be buttery-colored, thoroughly mixed in. Add ice water, mix lightly with fork.
Roll onto floured board.

3. Preheat oven to 450.

4. After peeling and thinly slicing approx. 1 lb apples, add:

- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
- Lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- Tiny pinch of salt
- Miniscule  pinch of allspice or cloves (careful. It’s potent!)
- 1/3 cup dark molasses
- 1/3 cup water, or less
- 1/4 cup flour 

5. Mix apple mixture well so that slices are well-covered with seasoning. Add lemon. Mix. Add water, stir mixture. Add flour (which will keep mixture from being too runny.)

6. Put apple mixture into pie shell pricked several times with a fork. You can go ahead and make a full pie, since apples will cook down. (grease a 9-inch pie plate well.) Cover pie with a second crust, make slits in the crust to “vent,” crimp the edges. 

7. Bake in preheated oven for 10-12 minutes till pie crust “sets.” Turn oven down to 350 and continue baking for approx an hour, or until mixture bubbles out and a knife inserted into apples comes out easily.

8. When pie is juicing and apples are soft, it’s done.",1700638375000,0.9902343750000001,Recipe,Loose_Koala534,https://i.redd.it/z3l8ifw0ru1c1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1813o0j/my_familys_apple_pie_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1813o0j/my_familys_apple_pie_recipe/,Homemade apple pie,695.0,0.79,33.0,32.0,20.0,95.0,9.0,4.0,0.9

Served two.

**Ingredients**

* Japanese leeks: 300g, white parts, with outer wilted layers trimmed. Washed, drained well and cut into sections on the bias.
* Beef: 200g of a lean cut, cut into strips across the grain.
* Marinade:  
Soy sauce 1tbsp

**Instructions**

1. Wash, slice and marinade the beef a few hours in advance. Leave it in the fridge overnight, or on the counter for 1 or 2 hours.
2. Start the rice, and get all your ingredients together before you begin to fry. It happens quickly, so have everything on hand.
3. Begin with the beef. Turn the heat up as high as it goes and let the pan get hot. Stir fry the beef until about halfway done and reserve.
4. Make a corn starch slurry with the reserved marinade.
5. The heat stays high. Let the aromatics fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
6. The leeks follow the aromatics. Stir fry, until ideally some charring happens.
7. Return the beef to the pan along with the marinade slurry. Toss to combine, taste and adjust, and serve.

* 2 teaspoons kosher salt

**Soup:**

2. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl. Turn the heat on the broth to medium and low boil for 20 minutes or until the liquid reduces to about 8 cups. Strain the broth through a sieve into a large bowl. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.
3. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bird and shred or dice it into bite-sized pieces. Reserve the skin for another use (like snacking on it or frying it up for a crispy garnish) and reserve the carcass for stock if you like.

**Start the soup:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook for 8–10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Add the garlic powder, thyme, and crushed red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the ditalini and cook for 1-2 minutes under al dente. Drain.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Taste the soup once more. Stir in the cooked ditalini, heavy cream, and baby spinach. Simmer for 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and season a final time. Turn off the heat. Note: You can also serve and store ditalini separately from the soup if you're averse to pasta swelling the next day.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with freshly grated Parmesan and a few basil leaves. Finish with freshly cracked black pepper, if you like.

**Short ribs:**

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 pounds boneless beef short ribs
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 cups low-sodium beef stock
* 3 cups Cabernet Sauvignon or similar full-bodied red wine
* 10 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly crushed
* 2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Parmesan mashed potatoes:**

* 4 large Yukon gold potatoes, about 1½ pounds
* 2 tablespoons butter
* ⅓ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
* ⅓ cup heavy cream or whole milk
* 2 tablespoons chives, minced
* Salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika to taste

**Prepare the short ribs:**

1. Pat the beef dry and season with salt and pepper.
2. In a large, wide pot, heat the oil over medium-high until hot. Add the short ribs in an even layer and cook without moving for 3 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 2-3 minutes per side until browned all over. Remove from the pot. Turn the heat to medium.
3. Add the garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and, using the back of your spoon, gently press the paste into any browned bits left in the bottom of the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes until the paste deepens in color.
4. Pour in the red wine and lift up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the beef stock. Bring to a boil. Add the beef short ribs back to the pot and reduce heat to a low simmer. Simmer, covered, for 3 hours. Taste and season.
5. Remove and discard the garlic cloves. Skim off as much fat from the top as you can. If you can refrigerate the short ribs overnight, you can remove the fat the next day before proceeding with the recipe. If you don't want to wait, just skim off what you can while it's still warm and proceed with the recipe as-is.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Remove the ribs from the broth and bring the broth to a rapid simmer over medium-low. Cook for 25 minutes until the broth reduces by half and thickens. Mount the cold butter into the sauce, whisking to incorporate until glossy. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
2. Using your fork, tear the ribs into large pieces. Add them back to the sauce and toss to coat.

**Prepare the mashed potatoes:**

1. Peel and quarter the potatoes. Cover with salted water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 20-25 minutes until fork-tender.
2. Drain the potatoes and return them to the warm pot. Allow any residual water to evaporate for 5 minutes. You can turn the heat to low to speed up this process.
3. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl with the butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and heavy cream. Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes until they reach your desired consistency. Add the chives, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and paprika, and mash to incorporate. If the potatoes seem dry, add a few more splashes of heavy cream.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the potatoes between plates. Add a few pieces of the beef on top and drizzle the sauce all over.

Taste and season with salt and a generous shake of black pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes or until the potatoes and carrots are fork-tender.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a medium pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the farfalle and cook until al dente. Drain.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Add the farfalle to the pot and simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and season. Turn off the heat.

17eso82,Chicken and Rice Soup,276,8,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Chicken and Rice Soup**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/chicken-and-rice-soup/)

Here's my recipe! I've been eating so much chicken and rice...this variation was SO good!

**Broth:**

* 2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 8 cups water, plus more if needed
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and quartered
* Salt

**Soup:**

* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 3 ribs celery, trimmed and diced
* 4 carrots, peeled and sliced into rounds
* 2 teaspoons dry thyme
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more if desired
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 cup dry white wine or water
* 1 cup jasmine rice, rinsed well
* 1 lemon, juiced
* 4 ounces baby spinach, chopped
* Salt and pepper

**Make the broth:**

1. Place the chicken in a large pot and cover with water. Add the onion and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Remove foam and scum as it floats to the top of the broth while the chicken cooks.
2. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl. Return the broth to a low boil over medium heat. Simmer for 10–15 minutes or until the broth reduces and darkens a bit in color. You should be left with about 5–6 cups of broth.
3. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the spent onion. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.

**Prepare the chicken:**

1. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, carefully pick the meat from the bones and shred it with two forks or your fingers.
2. Discard the bones and skin. You can also dice the cooked skin and air-fry or pan-fry it to make a crunchy garnish for the soup if you like.

**Cook the mushrooms:**

1. Turn the heat on the pot to medium. Add the mushrooms and cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes. The mushrooms will release water, and that water will evaporate.
2. Once the water evaporates and the mushrooms begin to “squeak” in the pot, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and cook for 2 minutes until golden brown. Season with a pinch of salt.

**Sauté the aromatics:**

1. Add the onion, celery, and carrots to the mushrooms and cook for 5–7 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, thyme, paprika, and crushed red pepper to taste. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Deglaze the pot with 1 cup of white wine or water. Stir well to lift up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes.
2. Pour in the prepared broth and bring to a boil. Stir in the chicken. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the rice:**

1. Return the soup to a boil. Stir in the rice and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes or until the rice is tender. Add another cup or two of water if the rice absorbs too much liquid. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Add the lemon juice and spinach. Simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls. Serve with more lemon or the crispy chicken skin.

&amp;#x200B;

Ingredients  
  
 

* 2 cups All-Purpose Flour
* 1 TBSP Baking Powder
* 1/2 tsp Baking Soda
* 1 tsp Fine Sea Salt
* 1/4 Cup Butter, Unsalted
* 1 Cup Buttermilk (or regular milk)

&amp;#x200B;

Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F / 230°C . If using a cast iron skillet, add 1 Tbsp Shortening and place it in the oven to preheat.
2. Whisk together 2 cups Flour, all-purpose, 1 Tbsp Baking powder, 1/2 tsp Baking soda, and 1 tsp Salt, fine sea in a large mixing bowl. Note: If you are using milk instead of buttermilk, leave out the baking soda. Baking soda reacts with the acid in the buttermilk to help with leavening, if milk is used then it is not needed.
3. Cut ¼ cup Butter, unsalted into cubes then using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour mixture. If you do not have a pastry blender you can either use two knives and slash them against each other, use your hands to squish the butter or if you have a food processor you can pulse it a few times.
4. Gradually add 1 cup Buttermilk (or milk) to the dry ingredients, if using milk you will need less of it since it isn't as thick. Depending on your environment, you may not need all of the buttermilk or you may need a bit more. The dough should be sticky but not too wet that you cannot handle it. If it becomes too sticky, simply add a bit more flour.
5. Dust a clean, flat surface with some flour and scoop out the dough. Sprinkle some flour on it then using your hands, knead a few times into a ball then fold the dough over itself 2 – 3 times.
6. Pat the dough to about an ½-inch in thickness. The thicker the dough, the higher the biscuits will be so feel free to adjust to your preference, you will just end up with more or less biscuits depending on thickness.
7. Cut the biscuits out with a biscuit cutter, cookie cutter or a cleaned out empty can. Set the biscuits aside.
8. Take the dough scraps, knead them together, pat it out, and cut out some more biscuits. You should end up with 8-9 biscuits.
9. Once they are all cut, remove the cast iron skillet from the oven and carefully place each biscuit into the hot oil (if using). Carefully flip over each biscuit so both sides are coated in oil, this will ensure both sides get browned. You want to place them closer together but not touching. As they start to expand, they will be forced to expand upwards instead of outwards.
10. Carefully place the pan back into the oven and bake for 10 minutes.
11. Check to see if they are golden brown and if so then remove from the oven. If they need more time, rotate the pan and keep an eye on them as they should be ready to pull within a few minutes.",1697944136000,1.0,Recipe,New_Organization_661,https://i.redd.it/cxdffklwwnvb1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17dinyf/homestyle_buttermilk_biscuits/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17dinyf/homestyle_buttermilk_biscuits/,Butter biscuits,,,,,,,,,0.72
17cim3c,Shrimp &amp; Broccoli Soba Noodles with Dashi-Soy Dipping Sauce,19,1,"**Recipe Link:** https://sowthetable.com/soba-noodles-with-shrimp-broccoli/

**Ingredients:**

* 2 bunches of soba noodles (small packages will have 3 bundles)
* 1lb of peeled and deveined shrimp
* 1 small bundle of broccolini or 1 crown of broccoli 
* 1 clove of garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon of neutral oil
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 cup of dashi or chicken broth (you can use HonDashi to make it quick)
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 2 1/2 tablespoons mirin
* 1/2 teaspoon of grated ginger
* 1 green onion, chopped
* \*optional: for garnishes, you could use green onion, sesame seeds, bean sprouts, sliced chili, chili oil, cilantro, etc. Toss in as many steamed veggies as you like!

Instructions:

1. Start by bringing a pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles for 5-7 minutes per package instructions. In the meantime, prepare a strainer and an ice bath. 
2. Once the noodles are cooked, immediately strain and add to the ice bath. Agitate and gently scrub the noodles in the bowl to remove any excess starch (prevents them from sticking together; especially important if you're meal-prepping this dish).
3. Make the sauce by combining the dashi, 1/4 cup of soy sauce, mirin, grated ginger, and green onion. If you don't have time to make dashi, you can use HonDashi which is like a dashi base. Just combine 1 teaspoon of the HonDashi with 1 cup of boiling water &amp; stir. 
4. Cook the broccoli in a pan over medium-high heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring often. Add in the garlic and toss for about a minute. Set aside. 
5. Wipe out the pan and over high heat, add a drizzle of neutral oil. Toss in the cleaned shrimp and stir fry for 3-5 minutes depending on the size of the shrimp. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and cook for another minute. Pepper to taste.
6. Plate the noodles, shrimp, broccoli, and garnishes &amp; serve the dipping sauce in a small bowl.

17cf204,Apple Jam,113,16,"**[Apple Jam + tips + tricks](https://youtu.be/nR3ZjkyoO5w?si=-mx81HziFgVdVTsn)**


**Ingredients:**


* 1.5kg of apples 


* 500g of sugar


* Skin of one lemon (zested or finely grated)


* Juice of one lemon


* 1.5 tablespoons of cinnamon


* 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger (grated)


* 1 teaspoon of nutmeg (ground)


* 1/2 cup of water


**Instructions:**


1. **Preparation:** Wash, peel, core, and dice the apples. To prevent them from browning, immerse the diced apples in water mixed with some of the lemon juice.


2. **Cooking:** In a large pot, combine the apple dices, sugar, lemon zest, remaining lemon juice, cinnamon, fresh ginger, nutmeg, and water.


3. **Boiling:** Bring the mixture to a boil on high heat. Once it's boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer. Cook until the apples are soft and mushy.


4. **Blending:** If you like a smoother texture, blend the mixture (an immersion blender works great here). I used a regular blender though. 


5. **Final Boil:** Transfer the blended mix (or keep it in the same pot if you used an immersion blender) and bring it to a boil once more. Then, reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer until it thickens.


6. **Testing:** To check its readiness, place a little jam on a plate and draw a line through with your finger. If it maintains the separation and doesn’t run, it’s ready!


7. **Storage:** Sterilize your glass containers by boiling them. For the lids, a trick I learned is to clean them with vodka. Pour the hot jam into the jars, seal them, and let them cool to room temperature.


Serve it on bread, muffins, or even as a topping for desserts. The fresh ginger gives it a nice kick, and the blend of spices makes it taste like autumn in a jar! 🍁

* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed, wiped clean, and sliced
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

* Sugar and crushed red pepper to taste
* 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
* 3 ounces baby spinach, roughly chopped
* Salt and pepper
* Smoked olive oil, optional, for serving

**Cook the orzo:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a generous pinch of salt and add the orzo. Cook until just shy of al dente, about 7 minutes. Scoop out ¼ cup of the pasta water and set it aside.

3. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and balsamic vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer the sauce rapidly for 10–15 minutes. If the sauce begins to stick or evaporates too quickly, add a splash of water and reduce the heat to low. Taste and add salt, pepper, sugar, or crushed red pepper to taste.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Add the chopped spinach to the pot and cook for 2–3 minutes. Add the orzo and toss to coat. Cook for 1–2 minutes until the orzo is well coated, adding a splash of pasta cooking water as needed. Taste and season. Turn off the heat.

* 3 pinches sesame seeds, roasted
* Parmesan cheese, grated
* 3 pinches black pepper
* 3 tablespoons chili oil, optional, recipe below
* Truffle salt, recipe below
* 1 teaspoon paprika 

**Directions:**

1. Bake sweet potatoes in the air fryer at 180°C (356°F) for 15 minutes, flipping occasionally.  
2. In a bowl, mix the chickpeas with 5 or 6 cloves of garlic, a bit of chili oil, some olive oil, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Put them in the air fryer rack next to the sweet potatoes. After the first 15 minutes of cooking are finished, bake them together with the chickpeas at 200°C (392°F) for another 15-20 minutes until fork tender, depending on the size of the sweet potatoes.
3. While the potatoes and chickpeas are cooking, sauté the mushrooms in a pan with the remaining garlic and a little olive oil.

16f6bk1,Potato-Leek Soup with Sage,441,21,"**Recipe here originally: [Potato-Leek Soup with Sage](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/potato-leek-soup-with-sage/)**

Serves: 4

Cook time: 1 hour

**Ingredients**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 medium onion peeled and diced
* 2 small leeks white and light green parts only, scrubbed and thinly sliced
* 4 ribs celery trimmed and finely diced
* 1 fennel bulb cored and thinly sliced, fronds reserved
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 5 cups water or low-sodium vegetable stock
* 1 pound potatoes scrubbed and peeled (or leave skins on, if you prefer), cut into 1″ cubes
* 1/4 cup heavy cream optional
* ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped sage
* Salt and pepper

**Cook the aromatics:**

1. Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften about 6–7 minutes.
2. Add the celery and fennel and cook for an additional 5 minutes—season with salt and pepper.

**Bloom the spices:**

1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the thyme, paprika, and garlic powder—Cook for 45 seconds.

**Prepare the roux:**

1. Sprinkle the flour over the aromatics. Cook, stirring regularly, for 3–4 minutes.
2. Slowly whisk in the water or stock in 1-cup increments. Whisk after each addition until smooth. Turn the heat to medium-high. Continue adding the liquid and whisking until all the liquid has been incorporated. Taste and season generously with salt and pepper.

**Cook the potatoes:**

1. Once the liquid is bubbly and simmering rapidly, add the potatoes. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 30 minutes until the potatoes are fork-tender. Taste and adjust the seasonings once more.

**Prepare the sage oil:**

1. As the potatoes simmer, prepare the sage oil. Pour the extra virgin olive oil into a small saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Once the oil is hot, add the sage. The oil should bubble as soon as the sage is added. Next, turn the heat to low and allow the oil and sage to bubble lightly over low heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Be careful not to burn the sage!
2. Turn off the heat and add a sprinkle of salt. Set aside.

**To serve:**

16e5wv7,Sage Scones with Cheddar &amp; Chives,238,6,"**SAVOURY SAGE SCONES RECIPE**  
*makes around 9 scones*

**Ingredients**

• 225g (approx. 1¾ US cups) **flour**  
• 11g (approx. 2½ tsp) **baking powder**  
• 4g (approx. ¾ tsp) fine sea **salt**  
• ½ tsp freshly cracked **black pepper**  
• ½ tsp **espelette pepper** *or other finely crushed / powdered dried chilies*  
• ½ tsp **chili flakes**  
• 55g (approx. ¼ US cups) **unsalted** **butter** *chilled*  
• 120g total (approx. 1½ US cups) of **freshly grated cheese** — use mature cheddar, emmenthal, and/or gruyère in whatever proportions you like  
• 100-120g (approx. 1½ US cups) **cream** *plus a bit more for glazing*  
• ½ tsp dijon **mustard**  
• fresh **chives** *you’ll need enough to get about 2 Tbsp’s worth, once chopped*  
• fresh **sage** leaves *you’ll need about 1 Tbsp’s worth, once chopped, plus 8 to 10 large whole leaves for topping your scones*  
• optional: extra virgin **olive oil** 

**Directions**

1. Preheat the oven to 205°C/400°F.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the **flour**, **baking powder**, **salt**, **black pepper**, **crushed dried chilies**, and **chili flakes**.
3. Cut the **butter** into cubes, then rub it into the flour mixture using your finger tips. Continue until the pieces of butter are pea-sized or smaller, and evenly distributed throughout. Sprinkle in all of the **chopped herbs** and 100g of the **grated cheese**. Mix again until well combined.
4. Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in 100g of **cream**. Stir through the **dijon mustard**, then combine the dry and wet ingredients until you arrive at a soft-but-firm dough that just comes together when pressed in your hand. If necessary, add up to 20g more of cream — a good way to do this is to remove the well-formed dough from the bowl and add liquid only to the dry crumbs remaining at the bottom, bit by bit. This enables you to hydrate only the parts of the mixture that need it, and avoids over-moistening the already-ready parts of the dough.
5. Tip the mixture out onto a lightly floured surface and use the palm of your hand as little as you can to pat it out into a rough circle, about 2cm/¾in thick. Using a lightly floured 5.5cm/2″ wide glass or biscuit cutter, cut out 9 or so scones, reforming the dough into a rough disk as needed in between rounds of cutting.
6. At this point, if you have room in your fridge or freezer, place the scones on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and transfer them to either to cool. In the meantime, bring a small pan of salted water to a boil. Pop in your reserved **sage leaves** for 30-45 seconds, just long enough to blanch them, then transfer them to a plate lined with a dish towel and pat them dry. Doing this will help prevent the leaves from shrivelling up too much and burning in the oven while the scones bake. At this point you may also want to brush each sage leaf with a bit of **olive oil**, although you don’t have to — it’ll make the leaves extra crisp.
7. Remove the scones from the fridge or freezer if you left them to chill. Brush each scone top with a bit of **cream**, then sprinkle the **remaining cheese** evenly over each scone, and top each one with a **sage leaf**. 
8. Bake for 17 minutes or so (every oven is different!), or until the scones have well risen and their cheesy tops look crisp and golden. Once out of the oven, they should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Serve immediately, or enjoy for up to 4 days post-bake: simply store in an airtight container at room temperature and reheat in the oven before savouring again.

Enjoy!

**Notes:** When it comes to scones, you want to keep the butter cold until the very end to maximise the level of flakiness in your finished bake. One way to do this is to chill the butter before you combine it with the other ingredients, and then, once shaped, to chill the unbaked scones once more just before placing them in the oven. [For more tips and details, feel free to check out the whole post here](https://www.allo-simone.com/recipes-en/savoury-sage-scones/) :)",1694270009000,0.9799804688,Recipe,fuzzician,https://i.redd.it/ue2h1xrsd8nb1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/16e5wv7/sage_scones_with_cheddar_chives/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/16e5wv7/sage_scones_with_cheddar_chives/,Cheddar & sage scones,207.0,0.6,11.0,1.0,6.0,21.0,7.0,1.0,

* 1/2 tsp dry mustard

1.  Put all ingredients in a wide mouth mason jar (Check that your immersion blender fits, if not you may need a separate container.)  
  
2.  Put immersion blender at bottom of jar, turn on. 
  
3.  When you start seeing Mayo form at bottom of jar start rocking blender off the bottom a little at a time and slowly raise up as Mayo forms until the whole jar has emulsified.  Shouldn’t take more than 30 seconds total with a good immersion blender.  
  
4. Scrape extra Mayo out of immersion blender into the jar and stir to check for any small pockets of oil.  
  
5. Put the lid on and refrigerate until ready to use.  

  
I had to start making my own Mayo because of a soy allergy and I don’t miss store bought at all. The flavor and texture on this are way better than even the name brand Mayo I was using almost exclusively.  Keeps in the fridge at least 2 weeks, possibly longer but I’ve used it all up by then every time. Tastes best after resting an hour or 2 in the fridge as the salt dissolves and lemon juice and vinegar mellow out, but is still better than store bought when fresh made.",1693794259000,0.8701171875,Recipe,speshuledteacher,https://i.redd.it/zeyy7et855mb1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/169ea7n/easy_homemade_mayonnaise/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/169ea7n/easy_homemade_mayonnaise/,Basic mayonnaise,267.0,0.17,29.0,0.2,4.0,0.2,1.0,0.0,0.76

These cookies are quite cake-y, I'd say less dense than a brownie but not as airy or moist as a cake. I'd say it's most similar in texture to European style crackle cookies.

Instructions  
1. To prepare bubble and squeak, start by chopping cooked cabbage or Brussels sprouts, carrots, and any optional meat into small pieces, ensuring the meat is heated through if using leftovers.

3. Gently fold in the cold mashed potatoes, being careful not to over-mash. Flatten the mixture in the skillet with a spatula and cook over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, allowing the bottom to crisp and turn golden brown. Carefully flip the bubble and squeak using a plate or spatula, adding more butter or oil and crisping the other side for an additional 10-15 minutes. Optionally, melt grated cheese on top during the last few minutes of cooking.  
4. Once both sides are golden and crispy, remove from heat, cut into wedges, and serve hot. Enhance with a drizzle of Worcestershire sauce or hot sauce, if desired.

Serves: 4

**Ingredients:**

* 1¾ pounds Yukon gold or russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
* 1 cup ricotta cheese
* ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving
* 2 tablespoons fresh chives or 1 tablespoon dry chives
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon white pepper
* 4 tablespoons butter, divided
* Splash of heavy cream or whole milk, if needed
* 2 ounces diced pancetta
* 1 medium shallot, peeled and sliced into rounds
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 pound pork tenderloin
* 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* ¾ cup chicken broth
* 8 ounces baby spinach
* ½ lemon, juiced (about 1½ tablespoons juice)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* Minced parsley, optional, for garnish

**Boil the potatoes:**

1. Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Add a liberal pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are fork-tender. Scoop out ½ cup of the cooking water and set it aside. Drain the potatoes.
2. Combine the ricotta, Parmesan cheese, chives, garlic powder, white pepper, and 2 tablespoons butter in a large bowl. Add ¼ cup of the potato cooking water and whisk until combined. The butter does not need to be completely melted. 
3. Add the cooked potatoes and use a masher to mash until mostly smooth. Taste and add salt and pepper. Add more of the potato cooking water or a splash of heavy cream as needed and continue mashing until the potatoes reach your desired consistency. Cover the bowl with foil and keep the potatoes warm.

**Cook the pancetta:**

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. Add the pancetta to a large, cold oven-proof wide pot and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook for 6–8 minutes, stirring frequently, until the pancetta is very crispy. Remove the pancetta from the pot using a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan.

**Caramelize the shallots:**

1. In the same pot over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once hot and shimmering, add the shallots, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes until the shallots begin to brown. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of sugar on top and continue cooking over low to medium-low heat (adjust the heat periodically as they cook) for 10 minutes more until evenly browned. Shallots burn very easily, so keep an eye on them!
2. Remove the shallots from the pot and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate. Season to taste with a sprinkle of salt. Carefully wipe out the skillet.

**Cook the pork tenderloin:**

1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the pot over medium-high. Once hot, add the pork tenderloin and cook for 3–4 minutes per side until the entire tenderloin is well-seared.
2. Transfer the pot to the oven and cook for an additional 15–18 minutes or until the pork reaches 135ºF at the thickest part. Remove the pot from the oven, transfer the tenderloin to a cutting board, and rest for 10 minutes. After the pork has rested, thinly slice and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.

**Make the spinach:**

1. Return the pot used for the pork tenderloin to the stove over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Once melted and bubbly, add the minced garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
2. Pour in the chicken broth and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Add the spinach and cook for 2–4 minutes, stirring regularly, until the spinach wilts. Add the lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and black pepper. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving platter and top with the spinach and a few spoonfuls of the pan sauce. Arrange the sliced pork tenderloin on top. Garnish with the crispy pancetta, browned shallots, and minced parsley. Spoon the remaining pan sauce on top of the pork.

15qep4i,Roast Squash and Apples,96,2,"Ingredients

•  1 whole Hokaido Pumpkin, skin on, seeds removed, and cubed (or a squash of your choice)

• 7 Diva apples, skin on, cored and cubed (or an apple variety of your choice)

• 3 Tbsp fresh sage, chopped (divided)

• 2 Tbsp Walnut Oil (divided)

• 2 tsp Sea Salt Flakes

• 1 tsp Fresh Ground Pepper

• 2 Tbsp Dark Maple Syrup (the darker the better)

• 2 Tbsp Brown Mustard

• 1/2 tsp Raw Apple Cider Vinegar

• Optional Garnishes: a sprinkle of Cinnamon or Sumac, Chopped Fresh Chives, Fresh Nasturtium Flowers

Method:

1. Preheat oven to 425 F
2. Prepare Squash: Toss cubed squash with 1 Tbsp Walnut Oil, 2 tsp salt, ground pepper, and half the chopped sage. Spread evenly on a baking sheet.
3. Place baking sheet in the oven and cook until squash begins to brown and becomes tender and delicious looking, about 20 minutes.
4. While the squash is cooking, toss the chopped apples in the remainder of the Walnut Oil and Sage (I add a dash of salt and pepper too).
5.  Add the diced apples onto the sheet pan, and stir to combine everything evenly. Place in oven for another 10 minutes.
6. During this cook time, immersion blend or stir together the Maple Syrup, Brown Mustard, and Apple Cider Vinegar. 
7. At this point the apples should still have some firmness, and the squash should be very tender. Take the Maple Syrup and Mustard mixture and drizzle it over the apples and squash. Place back in the oven and cook for 5 more minutes.
8. Remove from oven and plate! I garnished mine with some fresh Nasturtiums from the garden, but any fresh addition on top would be nice. Tarragon or Chives would be lovely! I've also garnished with sumac or cinnamon in other variations.

* 6 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
* ½ cup roasted red bell peppers, diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
* ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste
* 1 cup arborio, carnaroli, or any short-grain white rice
* ¼ cup vegan white wine, or use water and juice from 1 lemon

* 3 tablespoons plant-based butter (or use dairy if you don't keep vegan)
* ½ cup freshly grated plant-based parmesan (or use dairy if you don't keep vegan)
* Salt and pepper

**Sauté the aromatics:**

1. Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion to the pot and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, occasionally stirring, for 8-9 minutes until golden brown. Adjust heat as needed. Add the roasted red peppers, garlic, thyme, and crushed red pepper.

**Finish the rice:**

1. Turn the heat on the rice to medium-low and stir regularly. Continue simmering and stirring to cook off any excess liquid if needed.

COOK TIME: 25 minutes

TOTAL TIME: 55 minutes

SERVINGS: 4

CALORIES: 285kcal

**Ingredients**

* 3 cups day-old rice; see note below
* 2 cups water
* .5 ounce dry shiitake mushrooms
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 8 ounces baby bella mushrooms trimmed, wiped clean, and thinly sliced
* 5 scallions minced; white and green parts separated; reserve a pinch of scallion greens for garnish
* 1 small yellow onion peeled and small-diced
* 1 green bell pepper trimmed, seeded, and small-diced
* 2 small carrots trimmed, peeled, and small-diced
* ¼ cup light soy sauce or use low-sodium soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 2 tablespoons mushroom soaking water
* 1 teaspoon minced ginger
* Pinch of white pepper, optional
* Pinch of crushed red pepper
* Salt to taste

**Prepare the mushrooms:**

1. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Turn off the heat and add the mushrooms. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and dice them.

**Prepare the vegetables:**

1. Dice all of the vegetables needed for the fried rice. Place the baby bella mushrooms in one bowl and combine the white parts of the scallions, the yellow onion, bell pepper, and carrots in a bowl.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Combine soy sauce, sesame oil, 2 tablespoons mushroom soaking water, minced ginger, white pepper, and crushed red pepper in a bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside.

**Make the fried rice:**

1. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sliced baby bella mushrooms and cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes until golden brown.
2. Add the bowl of diced vegetables (scallions, onion, pepper, and carrots) to the wok with the mushrooms and season lightly with salt. Cook, turning often, for 3–5 minutes until the carrots soften and the onions are translucent.
3. Add the diced shiitake mushrooms and cook for 1 minute.
4. Add the cooked rice to the wok and break it up with a metal spatula. Turn regularly, being careful not to mush up the rice too much. It should make good contact with the skillet or wok. Cook the rice for 5 minutes until it crisps up in spots.
5. Make a well in the middle of the rice. Pour in the sauce, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat back to medium. Use your spatula to toss the rice in the sauce for 1–3 minutes until well-coated. Stir in green scallion parts and cook for 1 minute. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the fried rice between shallow bowls and serve the remaining scallion greens on top. Enjoy!

**Recipe notes:**

\*If you don’t have day-old rice, make 3 cups cooked rice from 1 cup dry. Rinse 1 cup of dry rice and combine with 2 cups water and a few shakes of salt in a small pot. Bring to a boil, stir once, cover, and simmer on low heat for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let stand for 5–10 minutes. Transfer to a sheet pan or pour into a large bowl and spread into an even layer (up the sides of the bowl if not using a sheet pan). Transfer to freezer for 15 minutes.

145y0wn,Chicken-and-Sausage Gumbo,718,33,"All these people commenting on the time it takes you to make the roux. 
Lemme tell ya.. It depends. 
Been in South Louisiana all my life and different rouxs are preferred in different areas. 
Some people think a dark roux is the ""proper"" way but that's not true. 
True ""Cajun"" chicken and sausage gumbo has a light and thin roux. Almost like a soup. Most true Cajuns I know do not like dark rouxs. 
New Orleans is where the dark roux is preferred. 
And then for a seafood gumbo it's dark roux all around usually. 
The amount of time it takes you to make a roux from scratch on the stove just depends on how high your heat is.. A lot of Cajuns will sit there on a roux for an hour or more and still have a light roux. 

This looks pretty decent. My only criticism would be the meat to liquid ratio is off, but that's all preference.

**INGREDIENTS**


**First Layer:**


* Heavy cream - 400ml


* Sugar - 40g


* Unflavored gelatin powder - 1 tsp


* Vanilla extract - 1 tsp


* Hot water - 2 tbsp




**Second Layer:**


* Fresh strawberries - 450g


* Sugar - 30g


* Unflavored gelatin powder - 1 tsp


* Hot water - 1 tbsp


* Water - 2 tbsp


**Instructions:**


**Step 1: Preparing the First Layer**


1. Start by adding the gelatin to 2 tablespoons of hot water and let it swell for a few minutes.


2. In a pot, pour the heavy cream and add the sugar.


3. Once the gelatin has bloomed, add it to the pot with the heavy cream and sugar.


4. Place the pot on low heat and stir for about 5 minutes to allow the gelatin and sugar to dissolve completely.


5. Remove the pot from the heat and let the mixture cool down slightly.


6. Pour the creamy mixture into transparent glasses, filling them about halfway.


7. Cover the glasses with plastic wrap or lids to prevent the surface of the panna cotta from drying.


8. Place the glasses in the refrigerator and let them chill for 2-4 hours, or until the first layer solidifies.

**Step 2: Preparing the Second Layer** 

9. In a small bowl, combine 1 teaspoon of gelatin with 1 tablespoon of hot water and let it bloom.


10. Cut off the tips of the fresh strawberries and transfer them to a cooking pot.


11. Add the sugar and 2 tablespoons of water to the pot with the strawberries.


12. Place the pot over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally for 7 minutes. This will help release the juices from the strawberries and dissolve the sugar.


13. Add the bloomed gelatin to the pot and continue to boil for another minute, stirring constantly.


14. Remove the pot from the heat and let the strawberry mixture cool for a few minutes.


15. Transfer the strawberry mixture to a blender and blend until smooth.


16. To remove the seeds and any pulp, strain the strawberry puree using a fine-mesh sieve.


17. Allow the strawberry puree to cool down for a while.


18. Take out the chilled glasses from the refrigerator and carefully pour the strawberry puree on top of the first layer, filling the glasses to the brim.


19. Once again, cover the glasses to prevent the surface from drying out.


20. Return the glasses to the refrigerator and let them solidify for at least 2 hours or until the second layer sets completely.

Enjoy your strawberry panna cotta!❤️

Full recipe: [https://www.theflouredcamera.com/instant-pot-chinese-braised-beef-and-daikon/](https://www.theflouredcamera.com/instant-pot-chinese-braised-beef-and-daikon/)

# Equipment

* 1 6 qt Instant Pot

# Ingredients

* 3 lbs beef rough flank
* 2 lbs Chinese daikon
* 6 cloves garlic (smashed)
* 2 stalks scallion (cut into 3 inch pieces)
* 3 small shallots (quartered)
* 1 inch ginger (sliced into thin pieces)
* ½ cup Shaoxing wine
* 3 tablespoon light soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
* 5 bay leaves
* 4 star anise
* 1 dried orange peel
* 1 cup low sodium chicken stock
* 3 tablespoon cornstarch (mixed with 4 tablespoon of water)
* Salt (to taste)

# Instructions

1. Pat the beef dry. Set the Instant Pot to 'Sauté' and wait for the pot screen to read 'Hot'. This can take a couple minutes. Add a neutral oil and then the meat. Sear both sides - this will take a couple batches. Even with the oil, you may find that the meat may stick a bit to the pot. Let it sear undisturbed and it will release much more easily.
2. Remove the meat and add the aromatics to the pot with some oil. Stir-fry until fragrant which should take about 2 minutes.
3. Add the meat back into the pot with light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine sugar, and oyster sauce. Stir to evenly distribute the sauce. Then add bay leaves, star anise, and dried orange peel.
4. Add daikon to the IP. Use a spatula to move the daikon towards the bottom of the pot so there's a better chance for the daikon to soak up the sauce. Finally, add the chicken stock.
5. Secure the lid on the IP. Set IP to Pressure Cook for 10 minutes. Let pot Natural Release.
6. Once you can remove the lid safely, set the pot back into Sauté mode. Add cornstarch mixture (pre-mix this in a separate bowl before adding into the IP) and allow the ingredients to simmer until the sauce thickens. Let simmer for another 5 minutes to slightly reduce the sauce.
7. Taste and add salt to your preference.
8.

135zvz9,"Lemon Chicken Pasta Salad with Basil, Asparagus, and Goat Cheese",102,1,"INGREDIENTS



• 12 ounces dry corkscrew or elbow pasta



• 1 pound boneless chicken breast



• 1½ teaspoons salt



• ½ teaspoon black pepper

 

• 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice



• 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil



• 3 large yellow bell peppers



• 1 pound fresh asparagus



• ½ cup fresh basil leaves



• 1 cup crumbled goat cheese



• ½ cup extra virgin olive oil



• ½ cup lemon juice



• ¼ cup sour cream



• 1 tablespoon white vinegar



• 1 teaspoon dijon mustard



• ¾ teaspoon salt



• ½ teaspoon black pepper



DIRECTIONS



1. Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Rinse the pasta under cold water until it is completely cool. Pour the pasta into a large bowl and hold it aside. 



2. Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally. Season both sides with 1½ teaspoons of salt and ½ teaspoon of black pepper.



3. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot place the chicken pieces in the pan. Cook the chicken for about 3-4 minutes until there is some browning on that first side. Flip the chicken pieces over and reduce the heat to very low.



4. Add in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice over the chicken and cover the pan. Let the chicken sit in the pan over low heat for 20 minutes. The pieces should be cooked through by this time. Remove the pan from the heat and let the chicken cool.



5. When cool enough to handle, slice the chicken into cubes and add them to the bowl with the pasta. 




6. While the chicken cooks, prepare the veggies: Slice the tops and bottoms off the bell peppers and discard the tops and the seeds and membranes from inside. Slice the peppers into small pieces. Add these to the bowl with the pasta. 



7. Wash the asparagus and snap off the ends. If the stalks are very thick, use a vegetable peeler to peel the bottoms of the stalks.



8. In a medium skillet add enough water for a depth of ¼-inch. Heat the water to a simmer and add in the asparagus. Cover the pan and steam the asparagus for 3-5 minutes until it is just tender.



9. Remove the asparagus from the water and run the stalks under cold water until they are cool. Slice the asparagus into small pieces and add them to the bowl. 



10. Rinse and dry the basil leaves, then tear them into small pieces and add them to the bowl.




11. Place the following into a jar that has a tight-fitting lid: the ½ cup of olive oil, the ½ cup of lemon juice, the sour cream, vinegar, mustard, the ¾ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Close the jar and shake the dressing vigorously to blend it.  




12. Pour the dressing over everything in the bowl and stir the salad together with a large spoon. All ingredients should be well mixed and coated with the dressing. 

  

13. Spoon the salad into serving bowls and top each bowl with some of the crumbled goat cheese. Serve the salad immediately. Makes about 8 cups.

[https://natashaskitchen.com/beef-stroganoff/](https://natashaskitchen.com/beef-stroganoff/)

Serves 2. Double ingredients for 4 servings.

Ingredients:

• 1 lb top sirloin steak, thinly sliced into strips

• 2 Tbsp olive oil

• 2 Tbsp unsalted butter

• 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped

• 1/2 lIb brown mushrooms, thickly sliced

• 1 garlic cloves, minced

• 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour

• 1 cup beef broth

• 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream

• 1/4 cup sour cream

• 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce

• 1/2 tsp dijon mustard

• 1/2 tsp salt

• 1/4 tsp black pepper

(To serve)

• 1 Tbsp green onion, to garnish

• 8-12 oz egg noodles, to serve

Instructions: 

1. Place a large deep pan or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 2 Tbsp oil and once oil is very hot, add thinly sliced beef strips in a single layer, cooking 1 minute per side without stirring.
Cook until just browned and no longer red. Sear beef in 2 batches so you don't overcrowd the pan.
Remove beef to a plate and cover to keep warm.

2. Add 2 Tbsp butter, chopped onion and sliced mushrooms. Sautee 6-8 minutes or until liquid has evaporated and onions and mushrooms are soft and lightly browned.

3. Add 1 minced garlic clove and sautee 1 minute until fragrant. Add 1 Tbsp flour and sautee another minute stirring constantly.

4. Pour in 1 cups beef broth, scraping any bits from the bottom of the pan then add 3/4 cup whipping cream and simmer another 1 to 2 minutes or until slightly thickened.

5. Stir a few Tablespoons of the sauce into 1/4 cup of sour cream to temper it so the sour cream doesn't curdle then add it to the pan while stirring constantly.

6. Stir in 1 Tbsp Worcestershire, 1/2 tsp dijon mustard, and season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper, or season to taste and continue simmering until sauce is creamy. Add beef with any accumulated juices back to the pan and bring just to a simmer or until beef is heated through.

Personal notes: While searing the sirloin strips, I lightly season it with salt and pepper, which adds more flavor to the beef. Rather than using 1/2 tsp salt in the sauce, I add just a couple dashes salt and pepper",1682307935000,0.9799804688,Recipe,suspicioushit,https://i.redd.it/4tic3jeiesva1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12x0998/creamy_beef_stroganoff/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12x0998/creamy_beef_stroganoff/,Beef stroganoff,438.0,0.5,31.0,3.0,17.0,8.0,30.0,2.0,0.94

**Ingredients:**

* 1 lb of boneless and skinless chicken breasts cut into strips
* 1 lb of boneless and skinless chicken thighs
* ¼ cup of olive oil
* 3 tbsp of lemon juice 
* 6 minced garlic cloves
* 2 tsp of salt 
* 1 tsp of paprika 
* ¾ tsp of cardamom 
* ¾ tsp of cumin 
* ¼ tsp of crushed red pepper 
* ¼ tsp of cinnamon

**Directions:**

1. To make this chicken dish, start by mixing the marinade in a ziplock bag or container. If using a container, you may need to increase the marinade by 50%.
2. Add the chicken to the marinade and massage it from the outside to coat it well. Place the bag or container in the fridge to marinate for at least 3 hours, or up to 24 hours.
3. When you're ready to cook the chicken, you can do it on the stove or on a BBQ. The spices in the marinade will give the chicken a nice crust and a delicious aroma.
4. After cooking the chicken, let it rest for at least 3 minutes before slicing or serving. This will allow the juices to redistribute throughout the flesh, rather than running out when you cut into the meat.
5. To serve, place the chicken, lettuce, tomato slices, onion, yogurt sauce, and flatbreads on a platter. Allow everyone to make their own wraps with the ingredients. If the chicken is larger, you may want to slice it. If it is smaller, you can leave it whole.

This enticing smoked salmon toast, accompanied by delicate soft-boiled eggs, presents a delightful, lively, and show-stopping dish that's effortlessly achievable for a Mother's Day brunch extravaganza.

My personal ace up the sleeve in this recipe is the homemade pea puree, which imparts a burst of refreshing spring essence to every bite.

**Ingredients:**

* 2 pc bread
* 2 tbsp pea puree
* 2-4 slices smoked salmon
* 2 pc large eggs
* 1 pc lemon, zested
* 1-2 tbsp fresh peas (optional)
* a few sprigs of fresh dill
* a small bag of mixed greens
* extra virgin olive oil for garnish
* freshly cracked black pepper
* Maldon sea salt (optional)
* softened butter (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions**

1. Fill a small pot of water high enough to submerge two eggs completely. Bring to a boil.
2. Once the water boils, gently lift the eggs into the water using a spoon. Set a timer for 6 minutes \*(see notes!).
3. After the timer goes off, drain the water and run the pan under cold water for 30 seconds to stop the eggs from cooking further.
4. Crack the eggs at the bottom and carefully peel the eggs. Cut in quarters and season with sea salt and black pepper.
5. Pick out the most beautiful herbs and salad leaves from your salad mix.
6. Using your hands, tear them into bite-sized pieces. Soak them in a bowl of cold water for 5 minutes and then allow them to dry on a paper towel.
7. Cook the fresh peas briefly in boiling salted water until tender. Drain, rinse quickly in cold water and reserve in a small bowl.
8. Cut the salmon into thinner pieces using scissors.
9. Toast the bread until crispy around the edges and butter both of them.
10. Spread a generous amount of the pea puree on the buttered toast.
11. Add the quartered eggs, then wrap the smoked salmon pieces around the eggs.
12. Garnish with the lettuce, herbs, fresh peas, a few cracks of black pepper, a little zest of lemon rind (using the Microplane), Maldon salt and olive oil.

**Notes**

If you have really sweet fresh peas, you can serve them raw, but quick-cooking them is usually the better option.

If you’re cooking eggs straight from your fridge, then 6 minutes + 30 seconds will be better. For eggs stored at room temperature (like here in Europe) 6 minutes is perfect. These times are for large eggs. If you have smaller eggs then you’ll need to cut back on the cooking time.",1681307837000,0.9799804688,Recipe,Ghiveta,https://i.redd.it/b2gc8qwxagta1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12jlf5x/15_minute_smoked_salmon_toast_with_eggs_herbs_and/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/12jlf5x/15_minute_smoked_salmon_toast_with_eggs_herbs_and/,Poached & smoked salmon pâté with bagel toasts,138.0,1.2,6.0,2.0,2.0,11.0,12.0,1.0,0.9

* 1/2 cup Granulated Sugar
* 1 tsp Cinnamon ground
* pinch of salt
* 1/2 cup Pecans roughly chopped

**Instructions**

Shortbread Crust

1. Preheat your oven to 350F (325F convection bake). Line a 9""x 13” baking pan with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, use clean hands to blend butter into sugar, flour, and salt. Continue combining until mixture resembles wet sand.
3. Press mixture into the bottom of your lined baking pan. Bake for ~15 minutes. Remove from the oven and prepare the pecan topping and apple filling.

Apple Filling

1. Peel and core 6 firm, sweet, and tart apples. Cut each apple in half.
2. Using a sharp knife or mandolin, cut apple halves into thin slices. Sprinkle with lemon juice to prevent browning.
3. In a large bowl, combine apples with flour, cinnamon, maple syrup, and salt. Mix until evenly combined. Pour apples and their juices over baked shortbread crust.

Apple Crisp Topping

1. In a medium bowl, combine flour, oats, sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Add butter and mix together with your hands. Mixture will resemble clay clumps. Add roughly chopped pecans and mix together one final time. Sprinkle over apple layer.
2. Bake apple crisp at 350F (325F convection oven) for 60-70 minutes. You will know when this apple crisp is done by taking it out of the oven and sticking a knife into the centre. If the knife goes into the apples easily with few crunches and some soft patches, it is done. Start checking readiness at 60 min, and check every 5 min thereafter.

* ½ Cup of White Sugar
* ½ Cup of Unsalted Butter (Melted)
* 2 ¼ Teaspoons of Yeast
* 5 Cups of All-Purpose Flour (Divided)
* 1 Teaspoon of Baking Powder
* 2 Teaspoons of Salt

Filling Ingredients:

* 1 ½ Cup of Light Brown Sugar
* 1 Cup of Unsalted Butter (Softened)
* ¼ Cup of Cinnamon

Frosting Ingredients:

* 4 Tablespoons of Unsalted Butter (Melted)
* 2 Cups of Powdered Sugar
* 1 Teaspoon of Vanilla Extract
* 3 – 6 Tablespoons of Hot Water

Instructions:

1. Make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the warm milk, sugar, and melted butter. The mixture should be just warm, registering between 100-110˚F (37-43˚C). If any warmer, allow to cool slightly. 
2. Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the milk mixture, stir, and let sit in a warm place for about 10 minutes until the yeast has bloomed. 
3. Add 4 cups (500 g) of flour to the milk mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined. 
4. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until nearly doubled in size. 
5. Generously butter 2 9-inch (23 cm) round baking pans and set aside. 
6. Make the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon. Mix well, then set aside. 
7. Remove the plastic wrap from the dough and add the remaining cup of flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir well, then turn out onto a clean surface. Leave a bit of flour nearby to use as needed, but try not to incorporate too much.
8. Knead the dough for at least 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough just loses its stickiness and does not stick to the surface or your hands. The dough should be very smooth and spring back when poked. 
9. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about ½-inch (1 cm) thick. Fix the corners with a bench scraper or a spatula to make sure they are sharp and even.
10. Spread the filling evenly over the dough. 
11. Starting from one short end, roll up the dough into a log and pinch the seam closed. Place seam-side down. Trim any uneven ends.
12. Using unflavored dental floss, cut the log into evenly pieces, about 1½ inches (8cm) thick. Place the cinnamon rolls in the prepared pans, 1 in the center and about 5 around the sides. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 35-45 minutes, until expanded by about half of their original volume. If you’re saving the cinnamon rolls for later, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for up 3 months.
13. Heat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C).
14. Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown.
15. While the cinnamon rolls are baking, make the frosting: In a medium bowl, mix butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. Add hot water 1 tablespoon at a time until the glaze reaches desired consistency. Spread over slightly cooled rolls.
16. When the cinnamon rolls are finished, let cool for about 10 minutes.

4. In a small sauce pan, add 3 tbsp (50ml) of water, 7tbsp (100ml) of lemon juice (2-3 lemons), and 1/2 Cup (100g) of granulated sugar. Turn it on to low-medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves. Once it starts boiling, add the 5 sheets of gelatin, turn off the heat, and stir for 1min before taking of heat, and leaving it to cool down for 5mins.
5. In a big bowl, add 12oz (350g) of Philadelphia cream cheese (room temperature), the zest of 2 lemons, and the lemon mixture from before, and whisk until combined.
6. In another big bowl, add 12oz (350ml) of heavy cream (35% fat, and better if it's chilled), and beat until medium-stiff peaks.
7. Add the Philadelphia mixture to the Heavy Cream mixture, and beat everything until combined. Then pour the mixture in the pan with the crust, flatten it out, and leave in fridge for at least 2 hours.
8. For the decoration, into a bowl with cold water, add 1 gelatin sheet. Leave it for later.
9. In a small sauce pan, add 3 tbsp (45ml) lemon juice, 2 tbsp (30ml) water, and 2 tbsp (25g) sugar. Turn it on to low-medium heat, and stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the gelatin sheet and stir for 1min. Then let the mixture cool down for 5min.
10. After those 5mins, you can add 1 or 2 drops of yellow coloring.
11. Pour the mixture into the Philadelphia pan. Pour it on top of the pan, on the back of table spoon, so it doesn't damage the surface of the cake. At this point you could also decorate with very thinly sliced lemon before putting it in the fridge for at least 2 hours.",1693253788000,0.9702148438,Dessert,OlegsKitchen,https://i.redd.it/zgq916p4iwkb1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/163v5hv/nobake_lemon_cheesecake/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/163v5hv/nobake_lemon_cheesecake/,Lemon cheesecake (no-bake),470.0,0.5,37.0,22.0,23.0,31.0,4.0,1.0,0.94
15ml4fi,Strawberry chocolate mousse cake recipe,187,12,"**Link with 4min** [video](https://youtu.be/ptmvdOfGJSc)

**Ingredients:**

* Crust
* 5.5 oz (154g) Oreo cookies
* 1/4 cup (60g) melted butter Chocolate layer
* 5 oz (150g) dark chocolate
* 1/4 cup (60g) + 1 cup (240g) heavy milk (35% fat)
* 2.5 gelatin sheets
* Strawberry layer:
* 10.5 oz (300g) strawberries
* 1/4 cup (50g) sugar
* 1 + 1/4 cup (300g total) heavy milk (35% fat)
* 3 gelatin sheets 

**Recipe:** 

1. For the crust, add the oreos to a food processor and crush for around 1 minute. Add the melted butter and process until it's evenly wet. You can also crush the cookies by placing them in a zip bag and using something like a rolling pin to crush them, and then mix them with the melted butter in a bowl. 
2. Add the mix to an 8-inch (20-cm) pan and even it out with a spoon or the bottom of a cup. It's better if it's a springform pan, but you can also use a pan with a removable bottom. Put it in the fridge until the first layer is ready. 
3. Place 2.5 gelatin sheets into a small bowl of cold water. 
4. Add the dark chocolate and 1/4 cup (60g) of heavy milk into a heat-proof bowl. Place it over a saucepan with simmering water, and at low heat, stir it until the chocolate is melted. 
5. Add the gelatin sheets to the bowl with the chocolate and mix it really well. Then let everything cool down to room temperature or until it doesn't feel warm to the touch (be careful not to leave it too long so the mixture doesn't set). 
6. Whip the cup (240g) of heavy milk (better if it's chilled) in a big bowl until stiff peaks, and then add the melted chocolate and mix until combined. 
7. Add the mixture to the pan with the crust, and even it out. Leave it in the fridge until the next layer. 
8. For the strawberry layer, add the strawberries to a food processor and blend until they are liquid. (Optional: After it's liquid, pass it through a sieve in case you don't want seeds.) 
9. Place three gelatin sheets into a small bowl of cold water. 
10. Add the strawberry liquid and 1/4 cup (50g) of sugar to a medium-heat pan and stir until the sugar is mixed (a few mins).
11. Place the resulting liquid into a bowl, add the gelatin sheets, and mix it really well. Then leave it in the fridge until it's not warm to the touch, around 30–60 minutes. If the gelatin has started to set, whisk well until smooth and loose again. 
12. Whip the 1 + 1/4 cup (300g in total) of heavy milk (better if it's cold) until stiff peaks, and then add the strawberry mixture and mix until combined. 
13. Add the mixture over the first chocolate layer and leave it for at least 3 hours. 
14. To remove the cake from the pan, run a knife along the edges of the pan.
15.  You can add optional cacao powder on top of the cake.",1691604409000,0.9799804688,Dessert,OlegsKitchen,https://i.redd.it/we0em3le94hb1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15ml4fi/strawberry_chocolate_mousse_cake_recipe/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15ml4fi/strawberry_chocolate_mousse_cake_recipe/,Strawberry & white chocolate mousse cake,737.0,0.89,59.0,35.0,35.0,47.0,8.0,2.0,0.96
15h3mim,Mini Angel Food Cake,51,4,"**Recipe:** https://themindfulmeringue.com/mini-angel-food-cake/

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup Granulated Sugar separated into 2/3c and 1/3c
* 2/3 cup Cake Flour
* 1 cup Egg Whites (from ~8 Eggs) or good quality carton egg whites
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Cream of Tartar
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract


**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 325F (300F convection bake). Place 4, small loaf pans onto clean baking pan (note: make sure there is NO oil on surface of pans! I used small (5""x3"") silicone loaf pans. If using other non-stick baking pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper)
2. In a small bowl, mix together 2/3 cup of sugar and 2/3 cup of flour to aerate and sift. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, and with an electric mixer on low speed, beat egg whites with salt and cream of tartar until frothy. Increase speed to medium-high and gradually add 1/3 cup of sugar until mixture resembles stiff peaks (note: this step may take a few extra minutes if using carton egg whites). Fold in vanilla extract.
4. In 3 additions, gently fold flour/sugar mixture into egg white mixture until well incorporated and no flour pockets remain.
5. Equally distribute spoonfuls of angel food cake mixture into each mini loaf pan. Bake for ~45 minutes or until angel food cakes have risen, spring back when lightly touched, and are gently browned on the surface.
6. Once removed from the oven, invert cakes and allow them to cool completely upside-down (either on a wire rack or with sides of pans resting on cups/container). Allow to cool completely at room temperature.
7. Use knife to loosen sides of loaf pan and invert onto flat surface. Optional: Top with sweetened whipped cream and fresh berries.
8. Enjoy!

**Notes**

* If making this dessert in other cake pans, evenly distribute the batter amongst pans and adjust baking time accordingly (when done, cakes should have risen and be lightly brown on the surface)",1691071248000,0.9599609375,Dessert,ferociousbutrfly,https://i.redd.it/gaqjbps38wfb1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15h3mim/mini_angel_food_cake/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/15h3mim/mini_angel_food_cake/,Mini Egg cake,600.0,0.8,30.0,63.0,18.0,75.0,6.0,1.0,

13xda9o,Polish Summer Fruit Cake,522,18,"Family recipe for a delicious and versatile cake.

&amp;#x200B;

**Preparation time:** 15 minutes

**Baking time:** 40-45 minutes

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for cake:**

\* 11.3oz plain flour, sieved (all purpose flour) 320g

\* 7oz of butter (room temp) 200g

\*8.8oz eggs (4 large, room temp) 250g

\* 6.3oz granulated white sugar, 180g

\* 2 flat tsp of baking powder

\* pinch of salt

\* 1tsp vanilla bean paste

\* 800g of fresh fruit (Strawberry, blueberry, rhubarb, apricots)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for crumble topping:**

\* plain flour 150g

\* granulated white sugar 120g

\* butter 120g

&amp;#x200B;

**Equipment:**

\* 13x9 inch baking tray (33cm x 23cm) If you prefer, you can also use a slightly smaller tray for this recipe. However, keep in mind that in that case, the baking time may be longer.

\* parchment paper

\* mixing bowl

\* standing mixer or hand mixer

\* spatula

\* cooling rack (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Polish Summer Fruit Cake:**

**1.** Preheat the fan-assisted oven to 365°F (180°C). Prepare a baking tray by greasing it lightly with oil and lining it with parchment paper to keep it in place.

**2.** For the cake batter, in a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until pale and fluffy. Reduce the speed to medium and gradually add the eggs one by one, ensuring they are well incorporated. Then, add the vanilla bean paste.

**3.** Stop the mixer and add the sifted flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix on low speed until the ingredients are fully incorporated. If the mixture appears too thick, add two tablespoons of milk or water and incorporate it.

**4.** Using a spatula, transfer the batter to the prepared baking tray and spread it evenly. Arrange the fruit on top; you can halve the strawberries, cut the rhubarb into chunks, and quarter the apricots.

**5.** To prepare the crumble topping, place all the crumble ingredients in a bowl and rub the mixture between your fingers until it is almost combined. Sprinkle the crumble evenly over the fruit.

**6.** Place the baking tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 40-45 minutes.

**7.** Once the cake is ready, allow it to cool for 10 minutes before serving. You can transfer it to a cooling rack, using a sheet of paper and the help of another person to expedite the cooling process.

**8.** Enjoy your delicious cake with a cup of coffee! Smacznego!

13rnl9e,Rhubarb tart with rhubarb ice cream,954,24,"**Recipe here originally: [Rhubarb Tart with Homemade Ice Cream](https://newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com/p/rhubarb-for-the-weekend)**

Serves: 10 | Cook time: 2 hours (plus 4 hours inactive time)

**Tart filling:**

* 1½ pounds rhubarb, trimmed and chopped (4 cups chopped rhubarb total)
* ½ cup sugar
* ½ cup water
* 4 drops of red food coloring, optional
* 6 egg yolks
* ½ cup sugar
* 6 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter; cut into cubes

**Rhubarb ice cream:**

* 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 16 ounces heavy cream
* ½ cup prepared rhubarb (from above)

**Tart crust:**

* ½ cup (53 g) whole pecans
* 1 cup flour
* ¼ cup (32 g) powdered sugar
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* For serving:
* Powdered sugar, optional

**Prepare the rhubarb:**

1. Combine the chopped rhubarb, ½ cup sugar, and ½ cup water in a medium pot and bring to a boil.
2. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30–45 minutes until very soft.
3. Use an immersion blender to blend until completely smooth. You may also use a traditional blender or food processor. Just pour the mixture back into the pot.
4. Let the rhubarb cool completely. Add the food coloring, if using, and mix well to incorporate.
5. Remove ½ cup of the rhubarb mixture from the pot and reserve for the homemade ice cream.

**Make the ice cream:**

1. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a medium mixing bowl and add the vanilla extract. Stir to combine.
2. Pour the heavy cream into a large mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, mix on medium speed until thick, stiff peaks form.
3. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into the heavy cream and gently fold everything together with a rubber spatula. Do not over-mix!
4. Pour the cream mixture into an 8-inch cake pan or loaf pan. Drizzle the reserved ½ cup of rhubarb on top and use the rubber spatula to swirl and mix into the cream gently.
5. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap. The wrap should be completely in contact with the ice cream without air bubbles. Use your hands to pat it down as tightly as possible. If there are air bubbles, ice crystals will form and make the top of your ice cream icy. Be sure the wrap is in contact with the ice cream from edge to edge. Transfer to the freezer until it is completely frozen, at least 4 hours.

**Prepare the tart crust:**

1. Preheat oven to 350ºF.
2. Place the pecans in a food processor and pulse them into a fine meal. Transfer to a mixing bowl with the flour and powdered sugar. Add ¼ teaspoon salt.
3. Melt the butter in the microwave or a small saucepan over the stovetop. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Let stand for 5 minutes. Pour the butter into the bowl of flour and pecans and use a rubber spatula to mix until there are no dry bits of flour and the dough is smooth and moist.
4. Place the dough into a 10” greased pie dish or tart pan. Use your hands to smooth it into the dish and up the sides in an even layer. Transfer to the oven for 15 minutes. Remove and let stand for 30 minutes. Keep the oven at 350ºF.

**Finish the filling:**

1. Add the egg yolks and remaining ½ cup sugar to the pot of the remaining rhubarb. Turn the heat back to medium and whisk until completely smooth.
2. Add the cold, cubed butter and continue whisking until the heat melts the butter completely. It will take 2–3 minutes of regular whisking. Continue whisking until completely smooth. Turn off the heat and immediately pour into the prepared crust.

**Bake the tart:**

1. Transfer the tart to the oven for 15 minutes; carefully rotate the tart once midway through cooking.
2. After 15 minutes, remove from the oven and do a jiggle check. It should be set up around the edges and slightly jiggly in the middle. It should wobble, not slosh. If it’s still very jiggly around the edges, return to the oven and continue baking in 2-minute increments until the tart is set around the edges but still jiggly in the middle. It should not need more than 20 minutes in the oven.

**Finish the tart:**

1. Let the tart stand for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, transfer to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight before serving.

**To serve:**

1. Slice the tart and carefully remove each piece. If you made this in a pie dish, it will be more difficult to serve but not impossible! Dust the tart with powdered sugar and serve with rhubarb ice cream on top.

2. In a small bowl, whisk flour and corn starch to aerate.
3. In a large bowl with an electric mixer, or in the bowl of a stand mixer, combine butter, oil, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix on low speed to combine and gradually increase speed to medium, mixing until butter mixture looks light in colour and creamy. Scrape down sides of bowl.
4. Add egg whites, one at a time, to mixture. Incorporating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract.  
5. In small bowl or mixing cup, combine sour cream with champagne. Mix until homogenous.
6. Reduce speed of stand/electric mixture to low and slowly add 1/3 of flour mixture. Then add 1/2 of sour cream/champagne mixture. Repeat flour and liquid steps, finishing with addition of the flour mixture. Scrape down bowl and mix one final time. Scoop 1/4 cup of batter into each cupcake liner.
7. Bake cupcakes for 22-25 mins or until toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Let cupcakes cool on wire rack.

Filling (champagne pastry cream)

1. In a saucepan, heat heavy cream and champagne. Bring to a gentle boil. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk sugar, egg yolks, and cornstarch. Whisk until mixture is creamy, pale, and smooth. 
2. Slowly pour all of the boiled liquid into the mixing bowl with the eggs, while vigorously mixing. Transfer mixing bowl contents back to the saucepan. Continue to heat mixture on medium-low heat until thickened, whisking often to prevent lumps from forming.
3. Remove cream from the heat. Add butter and whisk until melted. Add a pinch of salt and vanilla. Cover surface with plastic wrap (to prevent skin from forming) and let cool completely.
4. Cut a hole out of the centre of each cupcake. Remove cupcake lid and fill with 1 teaspoon of custard. Add the top of each cupcake lid back to the cupcake. Continue to make buttercream.

Champagne Buttercream

1. In a small saucepan/pot, bring champagne to a boil. Swirl mixture occasionally while allowing the champagne to reduce. The mixture is ready when it has reduced to approximately 2-3 tablespoons. (note: DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE POT! This mixture can burn quickly if left unattended)
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream butter on medium speed.
3. Reduce speed to low and slowly add powdered sugar to the butter. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as you go.
4. Once all powdered sugar has been incorporated, add the reduced champagne. Continue to mix the icing on medium speed until fluffy. If the mixture is stiffer than your liking, add 1-2 tbsp of heavy cream and continue to mix.
5. Put frosting in a piping bag with your favourite star piping tip and decorate each filled cupcake.

Decoration (optional)

* 1 cup Heavy Cream
* 2 tbsp Granulated Sugar
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1 cup Raspberries (fresh or frozen)

**Instructions**

1. Preheat oven to 325F (300F convection oven). Gather a 9"" springform pan, set aside.

Chocolate Cookie Crust

1. In a medium bowl, combine chocolate cookie crumbs with sugar and melted butter. Pour cookie crumb mixture into your 9"" springform pan. Press crumbs into the base of your pan. Set aside.

Cheesecake

1. In a large bowl, using a hand mixer, beat together softened cream cheese with granulated sugar. Mix until just combined.
2. Add eggs, one at a time, until mixture is smooth and creamy. Add vanilla and salt.
3. In a small bowl, add hot heavy cream to white chocolate. Let stand for 2-3min then stir until chocolate is melted. Add chocolate mixture to egg/cheesecake mixture. You want a mixture that is smooth and creamy.
4. Meanwhile, add sugar to thawed berries. Mix until combined. Let stand for 1-2 min to allow the sugar to dissolve into the berries.

Assembly &amp; Baking

1. Pour half of the cheesecake mixture into the springform pan with cookie crust. Add spoonfuls of raspberry to the surface of the cheesecake mixture, swirl with a knife. Add remaining 1/2 of cheesecake mixture, and repeat raspberry dolloping process. Use a toothpick/knife to swirl through the mixture, creating a spiral design.

Bake in a oven preheated to 325F for 1h 30-40 minutes or until mixture gently set at the edges and is slightly wobbly in the centre. Turn off oven and allow cheesecake to cool in the oven. (Note: I recommend partially propping open the door of your oven to allow heat to slowly escape while cheesecake cools).
3. Once cheesecake is cool to room temperature, place in the refrigerator to set for ~4h to overnight.

Decorations

1. Remove the rim of your springform pan. Place cheesecake on flat surface.
2. In a small bowl mix 1 cup of thawed frozen raspberries with 2 tsp of sugar. Stir until combined. Let sit for 1-2 minutes until sugar is dissolved.
3. In a medium bowl, combine heavy cream with sugar, and vanilla extract. Whip to a light, airy, whipped cream texture. Set aside.
4. Dollop additional raspberry sauce on surface of the cheesecake (note: I like adding additional raspberry mixture to the raspberry dollops/cracks in the cheesecake) and decorate cheesecake with pipped Chantilly cream. Top with additional raspberries, and shaved white chocolate, as desired!

**Tips on making no bake cheesecake**

* Use room temperature cream cheese to make it easier to mix and create a smooth texture.
* Make sure the crust is well chilled before adding the filling to ensure it holds its shape.
* Use a stand mixer or electric hand mixer to beat the cream cheese and other filling ingredients together until they are well combined and smooth.
* Be sure to properly measure the ingredients to ensure the right consistency is achievedIf the mixture is too soft, you can add some gelatine to help set it.
* Chilled the cheesecake for several hours or overnight to ensure it sets properly.
* You can also add some fresh fruits or chocolate on top of the cheesecake before serving.
* Keep in mind that no-bake cheesecakes are typically softer than baked cheesecakes.The cheesecake should be stored in the fridge and be consumed within 3-4 days.

10f892o,Cinnamon Rolls,2563,81,"**Recipe:** https://themindfulmeringue.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/

**Ingredients**

Dough

- 4 1/2 – 3/4 cups Bread Flour separated (1st: 2 cups, then 2 cups, then 1/2 - - cup, then optional 1/4 cup)
- 1/3 cup Granulated Sugar
- 2 packets Instant Yeast
- 1 1/3 cup Milk
- 1/3 cup Salted Butter cut into cubes
- 1 Egg large, room temperature

Cinnamon Filling

- 1/4 cup Salted Butter
- 3/4 cup Brown Sugar (light or dark)
- 2 tbsp Cinnamon

Cream Cheese Frosting

- 1 package Cream Cheese
- 1/2 cup Salted Butter
- 2 cups Powdered Sugar
- 1 tsp Vanilla Bean Paste or vanilla extract

**Instructions**

Dough

1. In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of flour with sugar and yeast. Whisk to sift and aerate the mixture. Set aside.
2. In a heat proof bowl/cup, heat butter together with milk in a microwave for 45 seconds (Note: not all the butter will be melted! The milk should be warm to the touch but not hot. If the mixture is hot, let it cool slightly before adding to the yeast/flour mixture).
3. Add the milk/butter mixture and egg to the flour/yeast mixture. Mix together with a wooden spoon until a thick, wet mixture is formed. Add an additional 2 cups of flour and mix to fully incorporate. Finally, add an additional 1/2 cup of flour until a soft dough is formed.
4. Knead together dough until it becomes homogenous, smooth, and soft. (Note: if the dough continues to stick to your fingers, add an additional 1/4 cup of flour and incorporate it into the dough). The final mixture should bounce back after a finger is indented into it. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes, uncovered.
5. Roll dough into a 15"" by 12"" rectangle.

Cinnamon Filling &amp; Assembly

1. Spread softened butter over surface of the dough rectangle, leaving a 1/2"" border that is butter free.
Combine brown sugar with cinnamon. Sprinkle cinnamon mixture over butter layer.
2. Roll dough from the 15"" end into a thick log. Once rolling is complete, gently push together both ends of the log to make them even. Divide dough into 12 pieces by scoring the surface of the log. Using an unflavoured piece of floss, slide floss underneath log and pull up to cut log (Note: this step prevents squishing the cinnamon rolls during the cutting process).
3. Place cinnamon rolls into a buttered 9""x13"" pan. Cover with a towel and place in a warm location to proof for 1 hour.
4. Preheat oven to 350F (325F convection oven). Bake for 30-35 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Let cool for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the cream cheese frosting.

Cream Cheese Frosting

1. In a medium sized bowl, combine softened butter with cream cheese. Start by mashing with a fork/spoon until creamy. Add powdered sugar and vanilla paste/extract then mix together until mixture resembles a clumpy paste. Finally, use a whisk to beat together icing.
2. Spread a generous layer of cream cheese icing onto the tops of the warm cinnamon rolls.

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1¼ cup all-purpose flour
* ½ tsp baking soda
* ¼ tsp salt
* 1 tbsp matcha powder ceremonial grade
* ⅓ cup unsalted butter browned
* ¼ cup granulated sugar
* ½ cup brown sugar
* 1 egg at room temperature
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 50 g white chocolate chips
* sea salt to sprinkle on top

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Brown the butter first Get a saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Add the butter and brown for approximately 6-8 minutes, or until you see brown bits at the bottom and a little bit of white foaming action on the surface. Once you see this turn the heat off and remove it from the stove. Let it cool down completely.
2. In a small mixing bowl combine the all-purpose flour, salt, baking soda and matcha. Using a sifter sift the ingredients to remove any clumps. The matcha will oftentimes be clumped together. Sifting it will ensure the matcha is evenly mixed to create a vibrant green color.
3. Take a mixing bowl and add the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar and mix until well mixed. Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix until you get a nice light creamy texture. Use a stand mixer to help mix it faster, but a hand mixer will also work fine. It will just take an extra minute or two to get the texture.
4. Add the sifted dry ingredients to the wet and mix with a spatula. Hand mixing will ensure the dough will not raise and fall flat in the oven by adding excess air to the dough.
5. Add the white chocolate chips and mix until well incorporated into the dough.
6. Use a cookie scoop/ice cream scoop 3 tablespoons to scoop the cookie dough (I get 8 cookies with this recipe). I let the cookies rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.
7. Take the cookies out of the fridge and preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
8. Cover your baking sheet with parchment paper and place the cookie dough 3 inches apart. Since this recipe uses less butter I like to roll the dough and press it down to give it a cookie flatten shape. Bake for 10-12 minutes. Take it out of the oven immediately and let it rest for 10 minutes on the baking sheet.
9. Move the cookies to a cooling rack.

z7gjk9,"Meringue Roulade with Lemon Curd, Berries &amp; Crushed Pistachio",1089,20,"**Meringue Roulade with Lemon Curd, Berries &amp; Crushed Pistachio**

Serves 8 - 10

If you would like to make your own lemon curd for this roulade my recipe can be found on my website [here](https://www.leviathanfood.com/recipes/lemon-curd). I would also really appreciate any follows on social media channels if you like the site!

**INGREDIENTS**

* 6 large egg whites
* 335g caster sugar (super fine sugar in the US)
* 300ml rich double cream
* 180ml lemon curd
* 250g raspberries
* 250g blueberries
* 70g crushed de-shelled pistachios
* 2 passion fruit
* fresh mint

**METHOD**

1. Preheat oven to 150°C (300°F). Line a flat tray with parchment paper, you will be baking the meringue on this and don't want it to stick to the surface. I use a 38cm × 35cm tray, but you can use any large flat rectangular tray that will fit into your oven. You will be rolling along the longer edge, so this will be the finished length of your roulade.
2. Add the egg whites and half the caster sugar to a bowl, making sure that it's clean and completely dry before beginning. If there is any moisture left in the bowl, the egg whites won't form. whisk the mixture until it's formed light peaks. Once they have formed, gradually add the other half of the sugar until it forms stiff glossy peaks. This will take about 10-15 minutes. 
3. Spread the meringue mixture evenly onto the lined tray, squaring off the edges as best you can. Place in the oven and bake for one hour. It should be a very light golden colour when it's done. 
4. Remove tray from the oven and turn upside down onto a fresh sheet of parchment paper. Carefully peel off the backing sheet, working slowly and with a knife to scrape the paper gently away in one piece. There will be pockets of carmelised sugar stuck to the paper you want to get all those pieces off as they add a lovely gooey texture. 
5. Whip the double cream until thick and gently fold in the lemon curd, keeping the air you've incorporated during whipping. Spread the cream and curd mix over the flat meringue and cover with a layer of raspberries and blueberries, about 2/3 of the amount. 
6. Make a light score with a knife about 2cm in along one long edge of the meringue, this is going to help you as a starting point to roll it. From the indent, gently roll inwards away from yourself, using the paper underneath to help turn it as you go. You shouldn't be touching the surface of the meringue with your hands, use the paper to do that for you. The ""seam' will sit on the bottom once it's rolled. The outer surface will crack a little bit, you can patch it up if need be once it's served. 
7. When the roll is almost complete, grab the paper and use it to help you transfer the roulade to a plate. It's helpful if you have someone to give you a hand shifting it onto the serving plate, they can hold the plate steady while you transfer. Decorate with the remaining berries, crushed pistachios, passion fruit and mint.",1669688484000,0.9799804688,Dessert,leviathanfood,https://i.redd.it/d92lbhgivs2a1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z7gjk9/meringue_roulade_with_lemon_curd_berries_crushed/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z7gjk9/meringue_roulade_with_lemon_curd_berries_crushed/,Almond & lemon meringue roulade,394.0,0.1,25.0,36.0,13.0,38.0,4.0,0.0,0.96

INGREDIENTS

* 4 Egg Whites large
* 1 cup Sugar Granulated or Caster
* 1/4 tsp Cream of Tartar
* 1/4 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1/2 tsp Peppermint Exact
* Red Gel Food Colouring optional
* 1 cup (140g) Semi-sweet Chocolate melted
* 1 cup (150g) Peppermint Candies

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 225F (200F Convection bake). Line 2x baking pans with parchment paper. Set aside.
2. In the clean bowl of an electric stand mixer, add the egg whites (carefully separated from yolks to ensure no oily, yolk residue).
3. Add the cream or tartar and salt to the bowl. Begin mixing on low. Once frothy, gradually increase the speed to high and begin slowly adding in the sugar (1 tablespoon at a time)
4. After all of the sugar has been incorporated, add the vanilla and peppermint extract.    
Once a stiff peak consistency has been achieved, turn off mixture. 
5. Add small dollops of meringue to the corners of your baking sheet, to prevent the parchment paper from sliding. 
6. Transfer meringue to a piping bag fitted with a large star attachment or with a piping tip of your choice. For added colour, you can add streaks of red gel food colouring to your piping bag before loading with meringue. As you pipe meringue the colour will deposit creating a swirled effect!
7. Pipe your meringues allowing at least an inch of space between each. Bake the meringues on the centre rack of the oven, at 225F for \~1.5 hours. Turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside for an extra 1-2 hour with the door propped open to allow for continued drying. 
8. Dip cooled meringues in melted chocolate then cover in crushed peppermint candies.

9. Add eggs, one at a time, beating between each addition. The mixture should be totally smooth.
10. Pour chocolate mixture into the prepared springform pan. Lightly tap the baking sheet on the counter to release air bubbles. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake in the 250°F oven for 1 hour.
11. Remove the foil and continue to bake for 1 hour or until the edges are set and the center is slightly wobbly.
12. Remove from the oven and let the cheesecake cool to room temperature. Once completely cooled, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or overnight.

* 1/4 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp Vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp Cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp Nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp Allspice 
* 1/8 tsp Ginger
* Note: These DON'T include pumpkin - the blend of spices give it the pumpkin spice flavour!   


**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Preheat oven to 200F.
2. In the clean bowl of a stand mixer, add the egg whites(carefully separated from yolks to ensure no oily residue).
3. Add the cream or tartar and salt to the bowl. Begin mixing on low speed until the mixture becomes frothy.
4. Once frothy, gradually increase the speed to high and begin adding the sugar (1 -2 tablespoon at a time).
5. After all of the sugar has been incorporated, add the vanilla. Mix to incorporate.  
Add spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger) to meringue mixture. Mix to incorporate.
6. Turn off mixer once a smooth, stiff peak, consistency has been achieved. You can now add gel food colouring to the mixture as desired.

8. Use a piping bag, fitted with a large star attachment (or tip of your choice!), to pipe your meringue kisses.
9. Leave at least an inch of distance between each meringue kiss on the baking sheet.  
Bake the meringues on the centre rack of the oven, at 200F for 1.5 hours. (The meringue cookies are done when they are dried throughout and lift easily from the parchment).

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTIONS**  
Crust:

1. For this cheesecake, I used a flat plate, rather than a pan, and an adjustable cake ring. Use a 9-9.5 inch plate.
2. Put the pistachios (cleaned) in the food processor and grind them, but not very finely.
3. Add the biscuits and continue to grind until the mixture is smooth.
4. Add a spoonful of sugar and the melted (but cooled) butter.
5. Mix well with a spoon until you get a homogeneous mixture. If the dough is too crumbly, add 1-2 tablespoons of milk.
6. Place the adjustable ring on the plate and try to avoid it moving as you put in the biscuit crust.
7. Even out the biscuit crust, and press down with a spoon, being careful not to move the ring. Refrigerate.Raspberry cream:
8. Put the raspberries (they can be frozen) in a saucepan with water and boil until it begins to thicken.
9. Add the sugar and cook until it approaches the consistency of jam.

11. Mix the cheese with 100 gr (3.5 oz) powdered sugar in a saucepan over the heat until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is warm.
12. Rehydrate the gelatin in 30 ml (1 fl. oz) of cold water.
13. Leave for 5 minutes, then pour over the cream cheese and mix well. Add the vanilla extract.
14. Refrigerate the cream until it hardens slightly, i.e. it has a creamy appearance, but is still liquid enough to mix without lumps.
15. Whip the cream with the remaining 30 gr (1 oz) of powdered sugar. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese.
16. Remove the biscuit crust dish from the refrigerator.
17. Top with the raspberry cream and level well.
18. Over the raspberry cream, spread the cream cheese and level again.
19. Refrigerate the cheesecake until the next day.Decorations:
20. After 24 hours, take the cheesecake out of the fridge and run a thin-bladed knife between the cream and the ring.
21. Take the knife full circle and carefully remove the ring.
22. Melt 50 gr (1.75 oz) white chocolate with a tablespoon of oil in bain marie.
23. When completely melted, use the chocolate to decorate the cheesecake.

* 1 1/2 cup (340g) Unsalted Butter
* 1 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1/2 cup (70g) Chocolate Cookie crumbs finely ground

  
**INSTRUCTIONS**

  
**Oreo Cupcakes**

1. Preheat oven to 350F (convection bake 325F). Line 2x cupcake pans with paper liners. Place an Oreo cookie on the bottom of each cupcake holder. Set aside.
2.  In a small bowl, whisk flour and corn starch together to sift and aerate mixture. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl or in the bowl of an electric stand mixer, combine butter, oil, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix on low speed to combine. Gradually increase speed to medium for \~3 minutes. Mixture will look light in colour and creamy. Scrape down sides of bowl.
4. Add eggs and vanilla extract to the mixture. Once incorporated, slowly add 1/3 of flour mixture to the wet batter. Next, add ½ of buttermilk mixture. Repeat flour and buttermilk steps, finishing with addition of the flour mixture. Scrape down sides of bowl.
5. Add chocolate cookie crumbs to the batter. Mix one final time to incorporate.
6. Scoop 1/4 cup of batter into each prepared cupcake liner (with an oeo at the bottom). Bake cupcakes for \~25 mins or until toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Note: while cupcakes are baking, begin making Swiss Meringue Buttercream!
7. Let cool for 5 minutes in cupcake pans then move cupcakes to wire baking rack to cool completely.

  
**Cookies &amp; Cream Frosting**

1. Prepare one batch of Swiss Meringue Buttercream (full step-by-step recipe and trouble shooting tips on the blog). A condensed recipe version is shown in steps below.
2.  Clean bowl of your electric stand mixer. Add egg whites and sugar to the clean electric mixer bowl. Place bowl over double boiler – the bowl should not be touching the water). Whisk sugar and egg whites until the mixture is frothy and sugar has dissolved (\~5 min). Check the temperature with a candy thermometer – when ready, the mixture will be at 160F (71C).
3. Return egg white mixture to stand mixer. Whisk on medium-high speed. Beat until glossy, stiff, peaks form and mixture is no longer warm to the touch (\~10 min). Once meringue has cooled, replace whisk attachment with a paddle attachment and reduce mixer speed to LOW.
4. Begin adding butter. Continue until all butter has been added. Over the next 10-20 minutes, the mixture will turn from a smooth, loose mixture, to a curdled mixture, to one that barely pulls away from the bowl, and then ultimately to a smooth, sturdy buttercream! Continue to beat for another 3-5 min on LOW or fold by hand to remove excess air bubbles.
5. Add 1/2 cup of chocolate cookie crumbs to the prepared vanilla Swiss Meringue Buttercream. Scrape down sides of bowl and mix to incorporate cookie crumbs.
6.

*INGREDIENTS:*

**Sponge**

* 300g all purpose flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 170g unsalted butter, room temperature
* 220g granulated sugar
* 115 Greek yogurt
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 egg, room temperature
* 250ml milk, room temperature

**Frosting**

* 200g unsalted butter, room temperature
* Pinch of salt
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 3 tbs whipping cream

**Coating**

* 400g candy melts, white chocolate, or milk chocolate
* Coconut oil or commercial thinning flakes, to thin the coating if needed
* Sprinkles, if desired.

*METHOD:*

**Sponge**

1. In a bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and salt and mix well. Set aside.with a stand or hand mixer, beat butter and sugar. When sugar is fully incorporated, add yogurt, vanilla, egg, and milk and mix thoroughly.
2. Slowly add the dry ingredients and mix on low until fully incorporated.Pour the batter into two 8’ pans lined with parchment paper.
3. Bake at 350ºF/176ºC for 25-30 minutes. The cake will be done when a toothpick is inserted and comes out clean.
4. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, invert the cakes onto a cooling rack and allow to cool completely.

**Frosting**

1. Beat butter. Sift in powdered sugar in batches and mix well in between.
2. Once sugar is fully mixed into the butter, add the salt and vanilla extract and mix.
3. Add the whipping cream, about a tablespoon at a time, and beat on high until frosting is even and fluffy.

**Cake Ball Assembly**

1. Crumble the cake evenly into a bowl. Remove any tough pieces.Add approximately 75-100g of frosting. Mix until the frosting is evenly distributed among the cake, ensuring the cake retains a crumbly texture.
2. To test, gently squeeze some of the mix into a ball. If it retains its shape, it should be ready.Roll into 30g balls and place onto a lined cookie sheet.
3. Refrigerate for 2 hours minimum.

**Coating**

&amp;#x200B;

**INGREDIENTS**  
  

* 1/2 cup Unsalted Butter
* 3/4 cup Light Brown Sugar
* 1/4 cup Granulated Sugar
* 1 Egg large, room temperature
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1 cup All-purpose Flour

* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1 cup Rolled Oats
* 1/2 cup Semi-sweet chocolate chips

**INSTRUCTIONS**  
 

1. Brown Butter: In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt butter. Swirl pan every 30 seconds until butter begins to sizzle. Reduce heat to low. Continue swirling for \~3 minutes or until melted butter becomes foamy, makes popping sounds, and begins to take on a nutty aroma! Mixture will begin to turn golden brown and have brown flakes interspersed. Using a wooden spoon or spatula stir butter, lift browned butter bits from the bottom of the pan. Remove from heat and allow to cool. In the meantime, move onto step 2.
2. Preheat oven to 350F (325F if using convection bake). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. (This process aerates and sifts the dry ingredients!) Set aside.
4. Using a large bowl with an electric mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together sugars (brown and granulated) with melted brown butter.
5. Add in egg and vanilla extract. Stir until combined and scrape sides of bowl once more to incorporate all the batter.
6. Slowly add flour mixture to the wet butter/sugar/egg mixture, beating on low speed until just combined.
7. Add oats and chocolate chips to the batter. Stir until combined.

wwdx4c,White Chocolate Cheesecake,2113,55,"Ingredients:

* ¾ cup sugar (¼ for the crust and ½ for the batter)
* ½ tsp. Vanilla (use real vanilla extract)
* 3 x 8 oz. “bricks” of Philadelphia cream cheese (“full fat”)
* 4 tbsp. (½ stick) butter (not margarine)
* 3 large eggs
* 2 cups graham cracker crumbs (you could try chocolate cookie crumbs)
* ½ pint “half-n-half"" cream
* 24 oz. Nestles white chocolate morsels (4 cups)
* Spray-on oil (Pam)

Let the cream cheese warm overnight. Let the eggs warm for an hour.

1. Set up a double-boiler and add the white chocolate morsels and half-n-half. Stir occasionally.
2. In a small pot, put the butter on a low heat to melt.
3. In a small mixing bowl add the Graham cracker crumbs and ¼ cup sugar, and mix thoroughly.
4. In a large mixing bowl add ½ cup sugar, the vanilla and the cream cheese.
5. Mix in the three eggs one at a time, mixing as little as possible; you just want to distribute the eggs through the mixture. I use a large serving fork, and only “pull” through the cream cheese 3 times for each egg.
6. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
7. Spray a springform pan with a medium-to-heavy coat of spray on oil.
8. Add the melted butter to the smaller mixing bowl and mix thoroughly. “Dump” the small mixing bowl contents into the springform pan, distribute evenly, and tamp down lightly and evenly with something with a flat bottom (I use a drinking glass). Only press down with about 18 to 20 pounds of pressure.
9. Stir the chocolate until it's fully melted. Add the melted chocolate to the large mixing bowl.
10. Using a hand mixer on the lowest setting, mix the batter until the largest “shreds” of cream cheese you can see are about 1/8 inch long.
11. Pour the batter into the springform pan, and cover with aluminum foil. Lightly crimp the foil around the top of the pan all the way around.
12. Place in the oven for 1 hour.
13. After the hour, shut the oven off and prop the door open very slightly; don’t open it to the first “detent” (about 3 inches); I use the handle of a wooden spoon inserted as little as possible to keep it in place. After two hours, take the cheesecake out of the oven and put it on the counter for two hours.
14. Take off the foil; at this point you will think the it's “underdone”. The middle will have the consistency of cheesecake pudding. Release the “lock” on the springform pan and use a dinner knife to separate the cheesecake from the pan by running it around the inside edge of the pan. Then open the lock fully and lift the outer part of the pan off the base.
15. Put it in the refrigerator at least 12 hours, 24 is better.",1661333307000,0.9902343750000001,Dessert,Waldron1943,https://i.redd.it/fpsbxj3jgmj91.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/wwdx4c/white_chocolate_cheesecake/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/wwdx4c/white_chocolate_cheesecake/,White chocolate cheesecake,801.0,0.8,66.0,30.0,40.0,43.0,8.0,1.0,0.9

**Ingredients:**

* 1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough
* 14 oz chopped walnuts, some chopped very fine
* 2 1/2 sticks butter
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 cup water
* 1 cup white sugar
* 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup honey

**Directions:**

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9×13 inch pan.
2. Chop 14 oz walnuts and toss with 2 teaspoons cinnamon. Set aside.
3. Unroll package of phyllo dough. You might need to trim the edges to fit your pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered.
4. Sprinkle a handful of the walnut/cinnamon mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, and walnut mixture again, layering as you go. The final top layer should be about 6 – 8 sheets deep.
5. Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows then cut across, and then make the diagonal cuts. It helps to rinse knife and finger every couple of cuts. That keeps the knife and your fingers from sticking to the top layer.
6. Bake for about 40-50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.
7. Make syrup while baklava is baking. Heat 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water until sugar is melted. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla and 1/2 cup of honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently and keeping eye on pot to make sure it doesn’t boil over.
8. Remove baklava from oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. You won’t need all of the sauce. Let cool. Serve in cupcake papers.

vts7bj,Gooey Chocolate Brownies,1795,35,"I’ve been trying out different brownie recipes to get a really nice, not overly sweet, gooey brownie. 
After many attempts, from a tiny cookbook my grandma gave me, to BBC Good Food, and even this subreddit, I have found the perfect one (so you guys don’t have to).

[link to recipe](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-fudgy-homemade-brownies)

**Ingredients**

- 1/2 cup (115g) salted or unsalted butter

- two 4-ounce (226g) semi-sweet chocolate bars, coarsely chopped

- 3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar

- 1/4 cup (50g) packed light or dark brown sugar

- 3 eggs 

- 1/2 cup + 2 Tablespoons (79g) all-purpose flour (spoon &amp; leveled)

- 2 Tablespoons (10g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder

- 1/4 teaspoon salt

**Important to note**

I didn’t add vanilla extract OR chocolate chips because i didn’t have any, but the recipe says you can! I also used the grams measurement.

**Directions**

1. Measure your butter and chocolate out in a big bowl, then stick it on top of a saucepan with water (also known as a bain-marie) to melt it. Then, let the mixture cool, otherwise you’ll cook the egg.

2. Once mixture is cool, whisk in (I used a stand-mixer, but a good old handheld metal one will be fine, you’ll just end up super hench) the sugar and eggs. 

3. Make sure to use a sieve to sift in your salt, cocoa powder and flour. Then use a spatula to fold in the dry ingredients, don’t whisk!

4. Add your mixture to a lined tray (I line mine with baking powder, I don’t like just greasing it) and evenly spread out the mixture you have managed not to eat.

5. Bake in the oven at 180 degrees celsius (pls google the F equivalent) for about 25 minutes, after 20 I usually stick a butter knife in. You want your knife to come out with bits of crumbs and goo, but not too much. You **DONT** want the knife to be clean.

v3q8p6,Mudslide-style Chocolate Cake with Chocolate Ganache and Strawberries,102,5,"**Yield:** 6” 3 layer cake

You can see how I made it [here](https://youtu.be/bMT7ijRrJU4)

*Ingredients*

**Cake:**

* 220g all purpose flour
* 60g cocoa powder
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 300g granulated sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 240ml whole milk, room temperature
* 1 tbsp white vinegar
* 2 eggs, room temperature
* 100g vegetable oil
* 250ml boiling water
* \~500g fresh strawberries

**Ganache:**

* 350g chocolate
* 200ml whipping cream
* 30g unsalted butter
* Pinch of salt

*Directions*

***For the cake:***

1. Mix milk and vinegar and set aside for \~5-7 minutes, until the milk curdles. Preheat oven to 176ºC/350ºF.
2. In a large bowl, sit flour and cocoa powder, add baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt. Mix well.
3. In a separate  bowl, mix eggs, vegetable oil, and curdled milk.
4. Mix the wet and dry mixtures until uniform. Slowly add boiling water while whisking until the water is fully incorporated. Continue whisking until the batter is uniform (no lumps).
5. Line cake pans with parchment paper. I use cake strips to keep the cake from doming. Pour the batter equally among the 2 pans. Each pan should not be more than 2/3 full.
6. Put both pans on one cookie sheet and bake for 30-40 minutes. Cake is ready when a toothpick is inserted and comes out clean.
7. Once they are done baking, cool pans for 10 minutes on a cooling rack, then take the cakes out of the pans and set them on the cooling rack to cool completely (at least 1 hour).
8. Once the cakes are cooled, cut them into 2 layers each.
9. Wash, hull, and halve all but 3-4 strawberries. Chop or cut the remaining strawberries and set aside to eventually decorate the top, i.e., in a pile or a design.

***For the ganache:***

1. Melt the chocolate, cream and butter in a bain marie, then stir in the salt.
2. Turn off the heat. Once fully melted, set aside 225g of the ganache and chill (preferably until set, but it can be a little liquid).
3. Put the remaining bowl with ganache back on the saucepan (without turning on the heat) until the cake is assembled. If it sets, melt it until it’s liquid.

***Assembly:***

1. Place one cake layer, then arrange the strawberry halves horizontally flat side down around the edge of the cake.
2. Pipe the chilled ganache in the center, filling any gaps between the strawberries.
3. repeat with the next cake layer.
4. Place the final layer on top.
5. Pour the warm ganache over the top of the cake, allowing/pushing some of the ganache so that it drips over the sides.
6. Top with the cut/chopped strawberries.",1654230306000,0.9902343750000001,Dessert,shushyum,https://i.redd.it/er1rip9lrb391.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/v3q8p6/mudslidestyle_chocolate_cake_with_chocolate/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/v3q8p6/mudslidestyle_chocolate_cake_with_chocolate/,Angel cake with meringue icing & strawberry ganache,303.0,0.1,7.0,46.0,3.0,53.0,6.0,1.0,0.94
uk8dl7,4-Ingredient Chocolate Pudding,68,7,"Ingredients:  
- Milk 500ml  
- Sugar 90g  
- Agar- Agar Powder 7g  
- Milk Chocolate 150g  
  
Recipe:  
1. Mix Milk, Sugar, and Agar-Agar Powder until dissolved in a pot  
2. Cut Milk Chocolate into small pieces, add into pot  
3. Boil the mix until thick  
4. Pour into a rectangular mold, cool down for 1 hour, fridge for a few hours  

TIPS

* Using milk chocolate gives you the unmissable sweetness, but if you're a fan of dark chocolate, then just replace and add a little more sugar to balance things out.
* Use a spatula to help pry it loose from the mold, it should come out pretty easily after the sides have been loosened
* Eat it as is, or with whipped cream for that texture differential.
* The pudding is much much better cold, so be sure to keep it in the fridge for a few hours after it has cooled down. DO NOT KEEP THE HOT PUDDING IN THE FRIDGE, it will raise the temperature of the fridge significantly, giving possibility to spoil other things.

tshd9f,Tarte Tatin - Upside down plum tart,180,4,"  
**Introduction**

Tarte Tatin is an upside down pastry dish traditionally made using apples but I've use plums here for a sweet, jammy dessert.

There's an instructional video [here](https://youtu.be/Xe2UkwVKCQc) if you'd like to watch.

**Ingredients**

* 75g Sugar
* 40g Butter
* 300g Plums - halved and de-stoned
* 1 sheet shop bought puff pastry.

**Instructions**

1. Melt the sugar over a medium heat in an oven safe until it begins to caramelize. Don’t stir it but give the pan a shake every once in a while.
2. When the sugar has melted, turn off the heat and add the butter. Use a wooden spoon to mix in but be careful, the mixture will be VERY hot.
3. When the butter and sugar is combined, add the fruit cut side down and leave to cool for about 20 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, roll out the pastry slightly and cut around a dinnerplate that’s a similar size to the pan and gently lay the pastry over the plums, tucking the edges under with a blunt knife. 
5. Give the pastry a few pricks and bake in the oven at 200C for 25-30 minutes until golden brown.
6. Remove from the oven, allow to cool for a couple of minutes and then loosen the edges before flipping onto a plate. 
7. Serve with cream and enjoy.

video recipe [here](https://youtu.be/yO2uAJSlwoM)  
**INGREDIENTS**  
\* 2 cups All-purpose flour  
\* 1 cup Cake flour  
\* 1/2 cup Granulated sugar  
\* 1 cup Brown sugar  
\* 1 Cup butter (2 sticks)  
\* 1 cup mini chocolate chips  
\* 3/4 Cup milk, plus more as needed  
\* 2 tsp vanilla extract  
**INSTRUCTIONS**  
Preparing the flour  
1. Add all of the flour to a pan and turn the pan on medium high heat. Using a whisk, start mixing and shaking the pan ever so often.  
2. Continue to roast until the flour is heated through and has darkened ever so slightly. The flour is ready when it smells similar to popcorn and doesn't appear dusty anymore - it should develop some texture. About 12-15 minutes.  
3. Once done, immediately move the pan off the heat. Mix every 2-3 minutes to prevent any residual heat from burning the flour.  
Making the cookie dough  
1. Soften the butter by microwaving for 20-30 seconds on high. In a large bowl, add in the sugars and butter. Start your stand mixer with the paddle attachment and run on medium speed. It will take about 30 seconds to a minute. You can also use a hand mixer.  
2. When you have a smooth texture like peanut butter, add the 1/2 of the milk and all of the vanilla and mix again. Mix until the dough looks nice and fluffy and the colour is much paler. It will take about 30 seconds to 2 minutes.  
3. Start adding in the flour, little bit at a time while you continue to mix on low speed. Continue to mix until you have added all of the flour and the dough has come together. If the dough appears crumbly or dry, add more milk, 1 Tbsp at a time.  
4. Once the dough has come together, stop the mixer and add in the chocolate chips. Continue mixing until they are well combined. The dough should be soft and smooth - add more milk as required to achieve this texture.  
5. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 20 minutes. Scoop the cookie dough and enjoy!  
Notes: Don't leave the pan unsupervised at any point, the flour will burn and turn the cookie dough bitter.",1647808109000,0.8100585938,Dessert,cookingwithanadi,https://i.redd.it/9mb2331zllo81.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tiu2p5/chocolate_chip_edible_cookie_dough/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tiu2p5/chocolate_chip_edible_cookie_dough/,Edible cookie dough,165.0,0.4,7.0,14.0,4.0,23.0,1.0,1.0,0.6799999999999999

Enjoy this light and fluffy vegan lemon cake with dairy-free lemon frosting for a sweet and tangy treat.

Prep Time: 1 hr

Cook Time: 40 mins

Resting/Cooling Time: 2 hrs

Total Time: 3 hrs 40 mins

Servings: 12

**Ingredients**

**Dry ingredients for the cake:**

* 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
* 1 ¾ cups cake flour
* 1 ½ cups granulated sugar
* 1 tbsp baking soda
* ½ tsp salt

**Wet ingredients for the cake:**

* ½ cup soy milk, or other plant-based milk
* ⅔ cup lemon juice, or juice of 4 lemons
* ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
* ½ cup plus 2 tbsp oil
* 2 tbsp vanilla
* 3 tbsp packed grated lemon zest, from about 3 lemons

**Vegan Lemon Buttercream Frosting:**

&amp;#x200B;

* 2 cups vegan butter or margarine, (stick not spreadable in a tub)
* 8 cups confectioner’s sugar, sifted
* 1 tbsp vanilla
* ¼ cup fresh lemon juice, from about 2 lemons
* 1 tbsp bottled lemon juice, or 1 - 2 tsp lemon extract
* 2 tbsp packed grated lemon zest, from about 2 lemons
* 8 to 14 drops Lemon Yellow food colouring

**To Decorate:**

* Dried Lemon Slices

**Instructions**

**Cake:**

1. Line three 6-inch cake pans with parchment. I recommend using cake strips for a more moist, even bake. Soak in water until ready for use. Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C.
2. Add the sugar to a large bowl of a stand mixer, then sift in the remaining dry ingredients.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the liquid ingredients including the zest until fully combined.
4. Add the bowl of dry ingredients to the stand mixer and while mixing on low, gradually pour in the wet ingredients.
5. Mix for about 30 seconds or until most of the flour is just moistened and the batter is smooth with a few tiny lumps.
6. Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a large spoon or silicone spatula to mix in any dry flour. Don’t overmix.
7. Evenly distribute the batter between the cake pans. If using cake strips, squeeze out excess water, wrap around each pan and secure.
8. Place the pans in the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes with cake strips or about 20 to 25 minutes without. A skewer or toothpick inserted should come out clean.
9. Fully cool the cakes in the pans before removing them.

**Lemon Buttercream Frosting:**

1. Add the vegan butter and confectioners’ sugar to the stand mixer bowl.
2. Add the bowl to the stand mixer and mix on low while gradually adding the lemon juice and vanilla.
3. When smooth and creamy, remove about ¼ cup of the frosting and set aside. Add the lemon zest and lemon extract to the remainder.
4. Add enough food colouring to get your desired shade of yellow. The colour may darken as the frosting dries.

**To Assemble:**

1. Filling a piping bag, or zip-top bag with the corner snipped, with yellow frosting.
2. Dab a bit of frosting on a cake board, stand or plate. Place the first cake layer on the board.
3. Pipe a swirl of frosting on top, without gaps. Spread evenly then add the second cake layer.
4. Add another swirl of frosting, then the final layer, bottom side up.
5. Spread the top and sides with a thin layer of frosting to crumb coat. Place in the fridge for one hour or until the frosting is chilled.
6. Spread the sides and top with the remaining yellow frosting and smooth.
7. Dab some of the reserved white frosting at random spots on the cake. Smooth to add white streaks.
8. Place the dried lemon slices on the cake and add dots of the remaining white frosting with a #2 piping tip.

**Notes:**

* Warm lemons for about 20 seconds in the microwave, before cutting, for easier juicing.
* Scrape the mixer beater as long strands of zest may stick to it.
* Bottled lemon juice usually has citric acid added which can help add extra tartness and lemony flavour.

rdhspn,Iced Oatmeal Christmas Cookies,133,8,"# Ingredients

***Cookie Dough***

* 240 grams all-purpose flour
* 4 grams baking soda
* 3 grams kosher salt
* 200 grams rolled oats
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
* ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom
* ¼ teaspoon ground ginger
* 226 grams unsalted butter, room temperature (2 sticks)
* 200 grams light brown sugar
* 150 grams white sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 tablespoon good quality vanilla
* 135 grams pecan pieces
* 100 grams white chocolate chips

***Brandy soaked cranberries***

* 1 tablespoon orange zest
* 1 cup dried cranberries
* ¼ cup cognac or brandy

***Icing***

* 200 grams confectioners' sugar
* 3 tablespoons whole milk
* 1 teaspoon good quality vanilla

# Instructions

1. In a medium container with a tight fitting lid combine orange zest, cranberries, and cognac - stir together. Allow mixture to sit on the counter overnight (up to 12 hours).
2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and cover several full size baking sheets with parchment paper.
3. In a medium-sized bowl mix together flour, baking soda, kosher salt, oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and ginger - set aside.
4. In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment (or a large bowl if that's unavailable), add room temperature butter and both sugars - mix together until smooth and fluffy. Next, mix in the egg and vanilla until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and gently fold in all of the dry ingredients. The mixture will seem dry, but don't worry - the dough will hydrate during resting time.
5. Divide the cookie dough into roughly 1.5 ounce segments using a spoon or medium cookie scoop (you can weigh them if you want but it's not necessary), roll each segment into a ball, and place the balls onto a prepared cookie sheet. Bake cookies for about 14 - 16 minutes. Finished cookies will have light brown edges with a slightly soft center. Cool directly on baking sheet.
6. In a shallow wide dish (I used a shallow cake pan) mix confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla. Mix until icing is thick. To decorate, either gently dip the tops of the cookies into the icing or use a spoon to drizzle the icing on top of the cookies. Frosting will set in about an hour. Store in an airtight container. Cookies are best eaten within 5 days.

***Decoration:***

***Preparation:***

1.Preheat the oven to 180C(350F). Prepare a 18cm(7-inch) baking pan; set aside.

2.Sift dry ingredients together. Place sugar, eggs and salt into a mixer bowl and whisk until light and fluffy. Add dry ingredients(in 2 batches) into the batter and mix on a low speed. Add milk and melted butter and continue mixing. At the end add boiling water and mix until well combined.

3.Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and put it in the oven and bake for 40min until done. Insert a toothpick into the center of the cake if it comes out clean, it is done. Remove from the oven and turn the cake over onto the cooling rack. When the cake is completely cooled, cover it with plastic cling wrap and put in the fridge to rest overnight.

4.Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Put the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring it to a gentle boil. Do not stir the caramel. Gently swirl the pot to even out the sauce. Cook the caramel until it is a golden-brown color. Remove from the heat and add hot milk while whisking. Leave it aside to cool down a little then add the butter and salt, mix well till everything is incorporated.

5.Beat heavy cream with powdered sugar, cream cheese and vanilla extract until thick and smooth.

6.Using a large serrated knife, level the top of the cake and split into 3-4 layers of equal thickness.Using a palette knife, spread about 3-4 tablespoons of the frosting evenly across the bottom layer. Using a round piping nozzle, pipe a ring of frosting around the edge of the cake.Spread a layer of the caramel in the middle of the cake, then sprinkle with crushed shortcake biscuits. Repeat for the next layer.

7.Top the cake with the final layer, and spread the cream cheese frosting on the top and sides of the cake. Use a palette knife or cake side scraper to take off the excess buttercream and give a smooth finish. Chill the frosted cake for 15 minutes in the fridge, to allow the layer of frosting to firm up.

8.Add another layer of frosting to the top and sides of the cake, and remove the excess. Chill the frosted cake for another 15 minutes in the fridge.

9.Pour heavy cream into a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave on high until very hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chocolate chips to heated cream; whisk until smooth. Set aside to firm up a little – you want the ganache to be pourable but not too runny.

10.Fill the piping bag or squeeze bottle with the ganache you’ve made. Place the edge of the piping bag on the edge of the cake and gently squeeze the bag – the more you squeeze the more it will drip. Make it all around the cake.

11.Using a star nozzle, pipe swirls of frosting around the top of the cake; then spread another layer of the caramel, and sprinkle with crushed shortcake biscuits.

12.Top each swirl with a piece of Twix mini-bar.

Assembly/Decoration

1. Slice into eight wedges (as you would a normal cake).


2. Chop the bottoms off the candy canes and stick them into the long side of the wedges. Cover with whatever you are using to decorate. Enjoy!


NOTES

• I use metric (grams and decilitres) in my recipes because scales are the most accurate way to measure ingredients. At one time, I did convert to cups, but as these are not the same all over the world, felt that I wasn't comfortable converting myself.

1 large egg

50g (1.7oz) of melted butter

35g (1.2oz) of caster sugar

* 60g warm water
* 60g warm 2% milk
* 3 tbsp butter
* 2 1/4 tsp (1 pkg) dry active yeast
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt

Pumpkin Pie Spice:

* 1/2 tsp cloves
* 1 tsp allspice
* 3/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp ginger
* 1 tbsp cinnamon

Filling:

* 1/4 cup margarine (or butter, but I always forget to leave extra out)
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1 recipe \^\^\^ of pumpkin pie spice (roughly 2 tbsp)

Maple Cardamom Icing:

* 4 oz. warm cream cheese
* 1/4 cup 2% milk
* 60g maple syrup
* 1/4 tsp cardamom seed, ground
* 2 tbsp icing sugar

**Preparation:**

1. Mix together water, milk, yeast and 1 tbsp brown sugar.
2. When yeast is nice and foamy, add in all remaining dough ingredients except for 175g (or half) of flour and use a wooden spoon or paddle attachment to mix until combined.
3. Add remaining flour and knead in stand mixer on medium-high for about 5-6 minutes.
4. When dough is smooth and elastic, set aside in greased bowl to rise until doubled in size, approximately 1 hour.
5. While the dough is resting, you can make the spice mixture and icing by just combining the ingredients listed.
6. When dough has doubled in size, flour the top lightly, press out majority of the gas, and flip out onto a generously floured table.
7. Roll dough into a rectangle roughly 1/8 inch thick. You can either flour the top of the dough lightly or a rolling pin for this. I floured my dough.
8. Brush rolled out dough with 1/4 cup of margarine or soft butter, (I used margarine because my memory is similar to that of a goldfish and it's spreadable straight from the fridge) then evenly spread brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice overtop of the margarine.
9. Starting with one of the long sides, gently roll the dough up tightly, trying to avoid large gaps or air bubbles that may make the rolls fall apart.
10. Cut the resulting log into 12 equal pieces and set them cut sides down in a 9 inch oven-safe pan, covered, for 45 minutes to proof.
11. Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 20-25 minutes, until nicely browned and cooked through.
12. Top with icing if desired.",1633898099000,0.9599609375,Dessert,GraemesEats,https://i.redd.it/127a265idos71.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/q5f0gj/pumpkin_spice_cinnamon_rolls_w_maple_cardamom/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/q5f0gj/pumpkin_spice_cinnamon_rolls_w_maple_cardamom/,Pumpkin cinnamon rolls,398.0,0.58,16.0,24.0,10.0,56.0,6.0,2.0,0.7

Difficulty Level - Intermediate

​

TIPS:  
\- If your dough is too soft to be worked with at any point, place it in the freeze for \~10 minutes before continuing, this helps to set it, although you must work quickly as it becomes soft very fast. 

  
\- Oranges contain natural pectin, if you don't have pectin I suggest to use the peels of the oranges themselves (look up how on the internet). However pectin makes the it really easy to make any sort of jams, so i highly recommend to buy it from the store.

  
\- You can make dehydrated/candied Orange slices by placing slices into the oven for around 2-4 hours at around 100°C. Lovely for decoration.

  
\- You can definitely use a normal baking pan for this recipe. However, the perforated ring helps to make it look super professional. If you plan on using a normal baking pan, I suggest the blind bake method

**Ingredients:**

160 g Pitted Dates

120 ml Hot Tea

1 cup Whole Wheat flour

1 cup All -Purpose Flour

2 tsp baking powder

1/2 tsp sea salt

3/4 cups cold unsalted butter

1 egg

2 tsp vanilla extract

1/2 cup almond milk

1 egg

Powdered Monk Fruit Sweetener for topping (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

**Recipe:**

Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit 

Chop or grind dates and pour hot tea over them. Let them sit for 5 minutes.

Sift flours, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Rub the butter quickly and lightly into flour with fingers until the consistency of bread crumbs. 

Drain dates  and discard the liquid. Mix in dates using fingers

Beat egg, vanilla and almond milk together in a small town. Gradually pour egg mixture into the flour mixture a bit at  time. Dough should be wet and sticky but still hold form. Set aside extra egg mixture. 

Dust contour with flour and flatten dough using hands into a rectangle about 2.5cm/1in thick and 6cm/2.5in wide. 

For American-style scones, cut the dough in quarters, and then on a reverse diagonal, cut into eights. Pick up each one, and quickly dust each side so scone is completely dusted. 

Put scones on baking sheet spaced at least 2.5cm/1in apart, as thy will spread when baked. Quickly brush the scones with the remaining egg mixture. 

Bake 14-20 minutes in the preheated open until rise and golden. Dust with powdered monk fruit sweetener with a sifter or eat as is or with butter.

pujffo,Blackcurrant Bakewell Tart,81,7,"Bakewell Tarts aren't traditionally made with blackcurrant jam, but we found it works *so* well because the jam has such a zing to it. Obviously the pastry could be shop-bought to simplify things if wanted!

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients**  
*For the pastry:*  
\- 300g plain white flour  
\- 30g white sugar  
\- 1/2 teaspoon fine salt  
\- 200g cold unsalted butter  
\- 1 egg yolk  
\- 3 tablespoons cold water (the colder, the better)  


*For the filling:*  
\- 1 jar blissfully blackcurrant jam  
\- 130g ground almonds  
\- 30g plain white flour  
\- 100g caster sugar  
\- 110g unsalted butter at room temperature  
\- 2 eggs  
\- 1 teaspoon almond extract  
   
  
**Method**  
  
1. For the pastry, start by adding the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor. Cut the cold butter (it needs to be cold and firm) into medium cubes (approximately 1x1 inch) and distrbute the cubes on top of the dry ingredients. Pulse 16 times.  
  
2. Turn off the food processor, add the egg yolk and turn it back on its lowest setting. While it is running, add 2-3 tablespoons of water and process for up to 10 seconds, just enough to combine. The pastry should still be quite crumbly after these steps.  
  
3. Turn the pastry onto a flat clean surface and, working it as little as possible, form it into a ball. Cover it tightly and put it in the fridge for 1 hour.  
  
4. Pre-heat the oven to 180C/160C Fan. Once the pastry has cooled, dust a flat surface with flour and roll out the dough medium-thin, or to the thickness of your liking, into a circle. Roll it up in a rolling pin and unfold it on a tart case. Use excess trimmings to fill up any gaps or holes (tip: use a small piece of dough as a tool to press the pastry against the case, ensuring it is well fit). Leave the overhangings for now, i.e. do not trim the edges, but do save a bit of dough in case you need to fill any holes later.   
  
5. Using a fork, make several holes throughout the bottom of the pastry. Place a piece of greaseproof baking paper on top of the tart case and top it with baking beans, rice or any other grain to weigh it down. Bake for 15-20mins.  
  
6. Remove the case from the oven, remove the baking paper and beans and bake it for another 5 minutes. Remove it from the oven and, while the pastry is still hot, use a serrated knife to carefully go around the edges of the case and trim them. Leave your knife as flat as possible for a smooth cut. Trimming the pastry at this stage rather than earlier reduces shrinkage.  
  
7. Set the pastry aside. For the filling, beat together the butter and sugar using an electric mixer for approximately 5 minutes, until light and fluffy.  
  
8. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well in between, and finally add the almond extract, beating once again to incorporate.  
  
9. Delicately fold in the ground almonds and flour, just until combined. Do not overmix or use an electric mixer for this stage.  
  
10. Line the tart case with a full jar of Blissfully Blackcurrant Jam, and delicately add the frangipane filling on top, using the back of a spoon to carefully spread it throughout the tart.  
  
11. Bake for 35-40mins until the frangipane has set. Let the tart cool fully before removing it from the case. Serve with creme fraiche, and be happy.

pass5o,Creamy Lemon Bars,194,3,"*Ingredients*  
**CRUST**

* 1 cup  graham cracker crumbs (about 8 full crackers)
* 3 Tablespoons  unsalted butter, melted 

**FILLING**

* 6 ounces  brick-style cream cheese,  room temperature
* ¾ cup plain Greek yogurt, at room temperature
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature
* 1/3 cup granulated sugar
* 1/3 cup  fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)
* 1 Tablespoon lemon zest
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

*Instructions*

1. Preheat oven to 300°F . Line the bottom and sides of an 8 or 9-inch square baking pan with aluminum foil or parchment, leaving an overhang on all sides to easily lift the bars out of the pan before cutting. Set aside.
2. Make the crust: Mix the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a medium bowl until combined. Evenly press crust into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.
3. Make the filling: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute. On medium-high speed, beat in yogurt until completely combined. Then beat in the eggs and egg yolk until combined. Finally, beat in the sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract until everything is combined and no lumps remain.
4. Pour filling onto the crust. Bake for 28-32 minutes or until the center of the bars no longer jiggles (remove from the oven and gently wiggle the pan to check). Allow the bars to cool at room temperature set on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill for 3-4 hours or even overnight.
5. Once chilled, lift the foil out of the pan using the overhang on the sides and cut into squares.

Put the the mix in the cake mold and distribute well on the bottom and the boards of the mold. Put the mold in the fridge for one hour.    

 
INGREDIENTS FOR THE CREAM  
    • 500 gr of whipping cream   
    • 10 gr di gelatin sheets (soaked in cold water for 10 min and then squeezed), In my country we have gelatine in sheets, if in your country you have instant gelatin, just put 10 gr of instant product (not sure though if it needs to be heated).  
    • 250 gr of mascarpone cheese   

PREPARATION  
Put in the pan 50 gr of whipping cream and gelatin (soaked and squeezed, without water), heat for 5 min at the temperature 60 degrees Celsius stirring the mix in the process. After add mascarpone and the rest of the whipping cream for 30 seconds and mix it all actively in the process.   
Put all the mix in the mold and distribute evenly over the cookies base. Leave it is the fridge for a couple of hours to solidify.  

INGREDIENTS FOR THE JELLY TOP  
    • 350/400 gr of a fresh watermelon   
    • 8 gr of gelatin sheets  
    • 2 teaspoons of sugar   
 
PREPARATION   
Make a squeezed juice from a watermelon (depends what appliance you have at home, like a juice maker of you can make it manually.). Pour it in the pan, add sugar and heat 5 min at the 100 degrees Celsius stirring it constantly. Meanwhile prepare gelatin sheets by soaking them in the water. Then squeeze them and add to the juice+sugar mix and mix them other 20 seconds. Wait untill it is not very hot and pour it over the cheesecake. Leave it in the fridge for at least couple of hours.

* ½ cup granulated white sugar
* ½ cup light brown sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Strawberry marinade**  
\- Chop strawberries into small dice. Add 3 tbsp of sugar and the juice from a half lime, mix well.  
\- Place this marinade in the fridge while preparing other ingredients.

**Cake base**  
\- Add 5 eggs and 1 cup of sugar to a clean bowl, place the bowl over simmering water.  
\- Whisk well until the mixture is slightly warmer than your fingers. Remove the bowl from the warm water bath and keep whisking at room temperature, until it reaches the ribbon stage.  
\- Sift 1 cup of cake flour in, and gently mix well.  
\- Prepare a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Transfer the mixture to the baking sheet and gently cover it evenly.  
\- Bake the cake at 400F for 10-12 minutes.  
\- When the cake is cooled down, cut into 3 circles (the size is based on the bowl that you are using for assembling later, see the video for more detail.)

**Custard cream**  
\- In a saucepan, add 2 and a half cups of milk, and a few drops of the vanilla extract. Simmer the milk over low heat.  
\- In a bowl, combine 4 yolks and 4 tbsp of sugar.

\- Keep whisking until the batter becomes thicken, remove the pan from the heat.  
\- After it cools down a little, add the whole stick of unsalted butter(room temperature) and mix well.

**Assembling the cake**  
\- Drain the marinade strawberry. Cut the rest of the strawberries into thin slices.  
\- Place some plastic wrap in the bowl, so that the cake can be easily removed later  
\- Place the strawberry slices alongside the bowl. Add custard cream over it.  
\- Place the smallest cake circle in, add the marinade strawberry, and then cover with the cream.  Place another circle, marinade strawberry, and cream. At the end cover it up with the biggest cake circle.  
\- Cover the bowl with a plastic film and fridge it for at least 4 hours. So that the cake can keep its shape.  
\- 4 hours later, place a plate on the top and flip it, remove the bowl and the plastic film. And the cake is done.

oslh1i,Irish coffee,104,5,"First, boil water and fill your cup to warm it up while you’re gathering materials

* \-1.5 oz Bailey’s
* \-1 tsp (or more, to your own taste) brown sugar
* \-coffee
* \-whipped cream
* \-chocolate shavings

&amp;#x200B;

Dump water out of mug. Add brown sugar and whiskey, don’t stir. With a long lighter, light the alcohol fumes on fire and watch the flames dance for 15 seconds or so while the sugar caramelizes.  


  
Blow it out and add Bailey’s. Stir. Then add enough coffee to fill the rest of the cup. Make sure to leave room for whipped cream!  


  
Usually I like to whip my own (whip a cup of heavy cream with 2 tbsp sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. When soft peaks form, add a shot of Bailey’s and whip a few seconds longer for Bailey’s whipped cream) but after I shaved down a chocolate bar, I wasn’t feeling like the extra step so I used canned whipped cream. *One thing I have noticed about canned vs. fresh is that the canned stuff melts very quickly into the drink whereas fresh whipped cream will hold throughout the drink so you'll still have some left to slurp up at the end. Yum! So while I didn't follow my own advice for this picture, I do recommend taking the extra time to make your own.*

ofgddh,English Strawberry Meringue Dessert AKA Eton Mess,84,6,"This classic English dessert requires only a few ingredients and is quick to make. If you can get your hands on fresh strawberries, you must grab your whisk and make some of this delicious, perfect summer dessert!

**Enjoy the recipe and** [**our United Cuisines show on YouTube!**](https://youtu.be/L3TqgSEt9gI)

*INGREDIENTS:*

\- fresh strawberries \[0.9 lbs / 400 g\]

\- whipping cream \[1.25 cups / 300 ml\]

\- meringue \[1.1 oz / 32 g\]

\- vanilla extract \[0.5 tsp / 2 ml\]

Servings: 3

*INSTRUCTIONS:*

1. Wash the strawberries and cut into quarters. Remove pedicel and leaf cap except on three strawberries, which you can use for decorative purposes
2. Whip the cream, which probably is the one and only challenge in this recipe! Cool down your whisk and bowl in the fridge, which can make difference, esp. on hot summer days. The cream must be cold, too. We not only stored it in the fridge, but put in into the freezer for 30 minutes before whipping it
3. Perform stiffness test on your whipped cream: it should double in volume and remain in the bowl, when turned upside down shortly
4. Mix in vanilla extract into the cream
5. Assemble the Eton Mess by adding half of the whipped cream to the strawberries and break up the meringue into bite-size pieces and spread on top. Gently mix/fold everything and repeat the step with remaining cream and meringue
6. Transfer into your favorite serving vehicle and enjoy ASAP, otherwise the crunchy meringue will turn soft

**Note:** We did not add any sugar, for the meringue is extremely sweet already, and our ripe strawberries were great without any additional sugar.

\- 120g of cake (pound cake/chocolate cake/or any types of cake will work for this recipe)  
\- 1 tsp of heavy cream  
\- Melted Chocolate (1 tsp for the cake dough, 1/2 cup for coating the cakesicles)  
\- Strawberry slices \* 4  
\- 2 tbsp of sugar pearl sprinkles

**Material needed**  
\- Popsicle mold

Video tutorial: [https://youtu.be/4EzSX-BuWG0](https://youtu.be/4EzSX-BuWG0)

**Directions**

1. Break up the cake, add heavy cream and melted chocolate into the cake, it will make it stick together like dough.   
\*\* The ratio of the cream/melted chocolate to the cake is not fixed. I usually add a small amount at a time and roll it together, until it feels wet like a dough, and can be easily stuck together.
2. Melt the white chocolate, then fill the popsicle mold with it. Rotate the mold to spread the chocolate evenly, until it is covered all over the mold. Use a spatula to remove the excess chocolate.
3. Place strawberry slices on the mold, and then insert the popsicle sticks while the chocolate is still warm. 
4. Place the mold in the freezer for 5 minutes. Once take out again, add the second layer of chocolate to make sure the mold is fully covered. Freeze for another 5 minutes.
5. Add the cake dough in and gently press it to make sure it fills in all the gaps inside the mold.
6. Cover more melted chocolate on the top. Use a spatula to spread the chocolate evenly and then remove the excess.
7. Freeze for 5 minutes and it will be very easy to push the cakesicles out of the mold.  
\*\* If there is chocolate cover the strawberry slices, it would be a very thin layer and can be easily removed with a folk.
8. To decorate the cakesicles, add warm chocolate to a piping bag and fill around the edge between strawberry and chocolate. Add sprinkles on the top. The warm chocolate will work like glue and make the sprinkles stick to the cakesicle when it cools down.

Servings: 4

Calories: 544kcal per serving

**Ingredients**

* 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
* ½ teaspoon sumac
* 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper
* 1 lemon, juiced and zested; juice and zest kept separate
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 shallot, peeled and diced
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* 3 heaping tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 cups water, plus more if needed
* 2 teaspoons brown sugar, more or less to taste
* 12 ounces linguine
* ⅓ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, a pinch reserved for garnish
* ⅓ cup loosely packed parsley, minced, plus more for serving
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the shrimp:**

1. Place the shrimp in a bowl and season with sumac, Aleppo pepper, salt, and pepper. Add half the lemon juice and all of the lemon zest. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.

**Make the sauce:**

1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the butter. Add the shallot once the butter is melted and cook for 3–5 minutes until soft.
2. Add the garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper. (Note: I like it spicy, so I add a good amount of crushed red pepper; add as much as you like, and you can always add more later!) Cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.
3. Add the tomato paste to the pot and mash it into the aromatics for 2–3 minutes until it deepens in color and sticks to the bottom.
4. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, add 1 teaspoon brown sugar, and simmer for 30 minutes until reduced by half. Add more water if the liquid evaporates too quickly. After simmering, taste the sauce and add the remaining 1 teaspoon brown sugar if needed. Add salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a generous pinch of salt. Once boiling, add the linguine and cook until al dente. Reserve ½ cup pasta water and then drain the linguine and set aside.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings once more. Add half the pasta water and bring to a boil. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and minced parsley and stir until the cheese melts into the sauce.
2. Reduce the heat to medium and add the shrimp and the remaining lemon juice to the sauce. Cook for 5–8 minutes until almost opaque.
3. Add the linguine to the sauce and toss to coat, adding the remaining pasta water only as needed to loosen up the sauce. Once the shrimp are completely opaque, turn off the heat and transfer to a serving platter.

**To serve:**

1. Garnish the pasta with a pinch of freshly grated Parmesan and more minced parsley if you like.

1532z32,Summer Tomato Pasta with Sausage and Zucchini,448,19,"Grating tomatoes is one of the BEST ways to use up those over-ripe tomatoes. I love it because it's no-mess...you don't have to dice them or blanch them and you won't have skins in the sauce.

You just grate on the large holes of a box grater and you can whizz through a bunch of tomatoes in like 5 mins. You want to use juicy, super ripe tomatoes...avoid Roma tomatoes as they are too dry/firm.

I use this process for homemade salsa because honestly, i just hate chopping up tomatoes (I have slight eczema on my fingers and the acidity of tomatoes really effs up my fingers) so grating is a really nice way to prep them for me!

Just be mindful that there's a LOT of water in the grated tomatoes so you want to cook it off. I don't like straining them because I like cooking down the liquid; I think it makes a more flavorful sauce.

**Ingredients:**

* 1½ pounds large, ripe tomatoes (or use 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes)
* 1 pound hot Italian sausage
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2 small zucchini, trimmed and diced
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* Pinch of sugar optional
* 16 ounces rigatoni
* 5 ounces baby spinach
* 1 lemon, juiced
* ½ cup Parmesan, finely grated; a pinch reserved for garnish
* Salt and pepper

**Prep the tomatoes:**

1. Cut off a very thin slice from the bottom of the tomatoes.
2. Grate the tomatoes into a large bowl using the large holes of a box grater. Discard the skins.

**Cook the sausage:**

1. Heat a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the sausage and cook, breaking it up periodically, for 12–15 minutes until cooked through. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and drain off all but a teaspoon of the oil in the pot.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the onion. Cook for 5–7 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and zucchini and fry for 1–2 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper to taste.
2. Return the sausage to the pot and pour in the grated tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20–30 minutes or until the sauce is thick. Stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from sticking. The grated tomatoes make quite a bit of excess water, so you want to cook it all off!  Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Boil the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add a generous amount of salt and the rigatoni. Cook until 1-2 minutes under al dente. Scoop out 1/2 cup pasta water and drain the pasta.

**Finish the pasta:**

1. Taste the sauce and season once more. Add the baby spinach, lemon juice, and cooked pasta. Toss to coat for 2–3 minutes until the spinach is wilted. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and toss to coat for 1 minute more. Add pasta water if needed to loosen up the sauce and coat the pasta. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls. Sprinkle more Parmesan on each plate.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a generous amount of salt and cook the rigatoni according to package instructions. Scoop out ½ cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the pasta. Set aside.

Finish the sauce by adding the basil and lemon juice. Cook for 1 minute more. Then, turn off the heat and season once more to your preferences.

* 4 boneless, skin-on chicken thighs
* 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil, plus more if needed
* 2 shallots or 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* ½ cup diced sun-dried tomatoes
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste if you like
* ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
* 2 14.5-ounce cans whole peeled tomatoes
* Parmesan rind, optional
* Pinch of sugar, optional
* 12 ounces spaghetti
* ½ cup grated mozzarella
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Fried basil panko:**

* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 cup fresh basil leaves, finely chopped
* 1 cup panko
* ½ cup freshly grated parmesan
* Pinch of salt

**Fry the chicken:**

1. Preheat oven to 375ºF.
2. Heat 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Place the chicken into the pot, skin-side down, and fry without moving for 5 minutes until golden brown all over. Flip and cook for an additional 1–2 minutes. They need not be cooked through. Transfer to a plate.

**Start the sauce:**

1. To the pot of rendered chicken fat, add the diced shallots and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook for 3–5 minutes or until the shallots soften.
2. Add the minced garlic and crushed red pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 1 minute until fragrant.
3. Pour in the balsamic vinegar and bring to a boil.
4. Add the canned tomatoes and season all over with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then turn off the heat. Using a potato masher, gently mash the tomatoes. Add the parmesan rind and a pinch of sugar.

**Bake the chicken and sauce:**

1. Arrange the chicken on top of the sauce, skin-side up, and transfer to the oven for 20 minutes. If using bone-in thighs, increase cooking time to 30–35 minutes. Once the internal temperature reaches 165ºF, remove the pot from the oven and turn on the broiler.

**Cook the spaghetti:**

1. While the chicken bakes, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and cook the spaghetti until al dente. Remove 1/3 cup of the pasta cooking water and set aside. Drain the pasta.

**Prepare the fried basil panko:**

1. In a small pot, heat 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the chopped basil leaves and stir constantly for 1 minute until fragrant.
2. Add the panko and stir to incorporate. Cook until the panko deepens in color and toasts. Turn off the heat. Let stand for 5–10 minutes.
3. Stir the grated parmesan into the panko. Add a sprinkle of salt. Set aside.

**Finish the chicken:**

1. Remove the parmesan rind from the sauce and discard it. Sprinkle a bit of mozzarella on top of each piece of chicken. Drizzle the mozzarella with a touch of extra virgin olive oil, if you like. Transfer the pot back to the oven under the broiler, and broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Turn off the broiler and remove the pot from the oven. Scatter a bit of the basil panko on top of the chicken and transfer the chicken to a serving platter. Don’t worry if some of the panko ends up in the sauce!

**Sauce the pasta:**

1. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce. Add the pasta cooking water, as needed, and toss to coat the pasta with the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls and serve with a chicken thigh on top. Spoon more fried basil panko on top and garnish with fresh basil.

4. Add the grated cheese and continue tossing to coat, adding more pasta water as needed.

**Ingredients**

* 1 tbsp butter
* 8 oz of penne pasta
* 2 1/2 cups water or broth
* 14 oz can of crushed tomatoes
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 1/4 cup vodka
* 1/2 onion, diced small
* 3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning
* 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper
* 1/8 tsp black pepper
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan, plus more for topping
* 1 tsp salt

**Instructions**

**STEP 1**

Using a pan over medium-high heat or the saute mode of your multi-function pressure cooker, melt the butter and add the onions. Cook until translucent and soft, 3-5 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook until no longer raw.

**STEP 2**

Pour in the vodka and cook, stirring, until mostly evaporated; about a minute. Then add the crushed tomatoes, spices, herbs, and salt. Cook until this resembles a paste, stirring occasionally.

**STEP 3**

Add the water and pasta, stirring to dissolve the paste into the water and mixing everything together.

**STEP 4**

**FOR STOVETOP:**

Reduce the heat to medium, then cover the pan with a lid cooking until the noodles are done per package instructions or to your taste. Stir every few minutes to prevent the noodles from sticking together. If the noodles aren’t cooked to your liking by the time the liquid is reduced to a thick sauce, just add an extra quarter cup of water and give it a stir, then continue to simmer until it’s done.

**FOR INSTANT POT, NINJA FOODI, OR PRESSURE COOKER:**

Close the lid and cook on high pressure for two to four minutes, depending on what the table above suggests for your brand of pasta or choosing the time the table suggests that most closely matches your boil time. When the time is up, do a manual release of pressure by turning the valve and waiting for the hissing to stop or until it’s safe to open. Then open it and proceed to the next step.

**STEP 5**

Stir in the cream and parmesan cheese, stirring until the parmesan cheese melts into the sauce. At this point, stir in any add-ins or top with more cheese, then serve and enjoy!

* Milk ̴ 40 grams
* Cheddar cheese ̴ 15 grams
* Basil ̴ 2 to 3 medium sized leaves
* Black pepper ̴ 6 grams
* Italian seasoning ̴ 6 grams

DIRECTIONS

1. Cook the spaghetti according to packet instructions in salt water. Save some of that pasta water. Keep it al dante.
2. Chopping isn’t fun but you gotta do what you gotta do. Chop the onion into small cubes and garlic finely.
3. I prefer cast iron in this kind of recipes but you can use non-stick or any kind. Add some (or may be, a lot more than ‘some’) olive oil. Keep the heat on medium.
4. Add the garlic and onion. Fry for a minute. Don't burn it or brown it too much.
5. Next, add the dried herbs and chili flakes and a pinch or two of sugar. Fry until the onion’s translucent.
6. Time for the tomato puree to go in. Mix well and cook for 2 minutes.
7. Add a splash of milk and mix and cook for 2 minutes.
8. Drop a little pasta water and cover &amp; cook for 10 to 12 minutes or until the raw smell of tomato disappears.
9. Uncover and do a taste check. If needed, add salt (most probably, you won’t need to add anything).
10. Add the cheese and cover until the cheese melts.
11. Now add the spaghetti and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
12. Rip the basils and drop ‘em in the pasta.
13. Serve hot with a sprinkle of black pepper and Italian seasoning.
14. TIPS or so: Do NOT cook the spaghetti and store it. Cook the spaghetti WHILE you make the sauce.

•	1 egg  
•	¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced  
•	¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese

&amp;#x200B;

Steps:

1.	In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.  
  
2.	Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.  
  
3.	Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  
  
4.	To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.  
  
5.	Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.

wl0x7n,Caramelized Onion Pasta with Basil Cream,2947,63,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Caramelized Onion Pasta with Basil Cream**](https://exploringvegan.com/pasta-with-basil-cream/)

This is for a 5-ingredient project that I'm testing recipes for so that's why the ingredients are sparse! You can definitely add to this recipe. Garlic, spinach, kale, or cherry tomatoes would be great additions! If you eat meat, you can also add a protein like sweet Italian sausage or grilled chicken.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced
* 1 cup loosely packed basil, divided
* 8 ounces plant-based or dairy cream cheese
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (or basil-flavored oil)
* 16 ounces paccheri or rigatoni
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Roughly chop the basil and set it aside.
2. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook, stirring often, for 25–30 minutes until caramelized. Stir regularly and adjust the heat as needed to prevent the onions from burning. Season with salt and pepper.
3. As the onion cooks, combine the cream cheese and half the basil in a food processor. Pulse until completely blended. Add water, as needed, in tablespoon increments until the mixture is smooth and creamy. You will likely need 2–3 tablespoons of water total. Season with salt, to taste.
4. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the paccheri and cook until al dente. Scoop out 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta and set it aside.
5. Add the pasta cooking water to the caramelized onions and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes or until the liquid reduces by half. Add the remaining basil and the pasta and cook for an additional minute or two. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Turn off the heat.
6. Spoon the basil cream onto plates and smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Pile the pasta on top of the cream and serve with a few additional basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil if you like.

After 10 minutes, add one shrimp Maggi cube, grated ginger, grated garlic, and the other spices which are; one teaspoon of black pepper, one teaspoon of chili powder pepper, and one teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of curry powder, 1/4 teaspoon of oregano and stir.

This sweet potato and sausage ragù is intensely spicy with just a touch of sweetness for the ultimate pasta dinner recipe!

### Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot

### Ingredients

* 2 teaspoons olive oil
* 1 pound hot Italian sausage loose
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 1 large sweet potato peeled and diced
* 8 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper trimmed and minced, or use crushed red pepper to taste
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon dry oregano
* 1 cup water stock, or wine
* 28- ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon maple syrup or a pinch of sugar optional
* 15 basil leaves roughly chopped, plus more for serving
* ½ cup mascarpone cheese
* 16 ounces rigatoni penne, or ziti, 1/2 cup pasta cooking water reserved
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### For serving:

* Chili oil optional

### Instructions

#### Brown the sausage:

* Heat the olive oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook for 15 minutes, breaking it up as it cooks. Once the sausage is completely cooked through, transfer it to a bowl.

#### Cook the aromatics:

* Add the onion and sweet potato to the rendered fat from the sausage. Cook over medium heat for 8–9 minutes until just beginning to brown and soften. Season with salt and pepper.
* Add the minced garlic and red Fresno chili pepper to the pot and cook for 1 minute.
* Create a well in the middle of the vegetables and add the butter. Once melted and bubbly, add the oregano and thyme and let them sizzle in the butter for 30–45 seconds. Toss to coat the vegetables with spices.

#### Deglaze the pot:

* Pour in the water, stock, or wine, and scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat.

#### Simmer the ragù:

* Add the tomatoes and the cooked sausage to the pot. Add the maple syrup or sugar, and then season with salt and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, for 30–45 minutes. Stir the ragù occasionally, breaking up the tomatoes and lightly mashing the sweet potato as it cooks. Taste and season once more with salt and pepper.

#### Finish the ragù:

* Taste the ragù and season once more. Add the chopped basil and the mascarpone cheese and cook for 5 minutes more.

#### Cook the pasta:

* While the ragù simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the rigatoni until al dente. Next, scoop out 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water.

#### Sauce the pasta:

* Drain the ragu and add it to the sauce and toss to coat. Add a bit of the pasta cooking water to thin out the seasoning. You may not use it all! Turn off the heat once the pasta is glossy and coated with the sauce.

#### To serve:

* Divide the pasta between shallow bowls and garnish with more basil. Add a drizzle of chili oil, if you like.

\- Parmigiano Reggiano \[4.2 oz / 120 g\]

\- mozzarella \[4.4 oz / 125 g\]

\- young gouda cheese \[4.4 oz / 125 g\]

Servings: 6

*INSTRUCTIONS*:

1. Over medium-low heat, sauté one crushed garlic in 1 tablespoon olive oil for a minute and add the spinach (all of the spinach might not fit at once, but it will wilt a lot, so add one batch after another into the pan)
2. With a kitchen tong, mix and turn spinach upside down until fully cooked (wilted and takes on a dark green color). Put in a bowl and set aside to cool down
3. Finely chop the onion and sauté in the empty pan with a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-low heat for a few minutes till translucent
4. Crush in a garlic clove and sauté together for another minutes
5. Add the canned plum and cherry tomatoes by scrunching them through your clean hands over the pan
6. Add a handful of basil leaves (chopped) and the lemon juice, as well as one bay leaf (optional)
7. Let simmer for approximately 20 minutes till sauce thickens a bit. Season to taste with salt &amp; pepper
8. Squeeze the spinach, which should have cooled down by now, and chop it in small pieces. Discard the spinach water
9. In a big enough bowl, mix the spinach with the ricotta, an egg and a handful of grated Parmigiano Reggiano. Season to taste after thoroughly mixing it
10. Spread a bit of tomato sauce over the casserole pan
11. Start injecting the spinach-ricotta mix into the cannelloni (we used an icing-bag) and place them in the casserole pan
12. Pour all of the remaining tomato sauce evenly over all cannelloni and sprinkle with a teaspoon of oregano
13. Grate the cheese you want to use for the casserole's top: we used mozzarella \[4.4 oz / 125 g\], young gouda \[4.4 oz / 125 g\] and Parmigiano Reggiano \[2.8 oz / 80 g\]
14. Cover everything with the grated cheese and cook in pre-heated oven \[355°F / 180°C\] for 30-40 minutes. We put it on the lower third part of our electric top-down-heat oven an it turned out great. It might differ in your oven! If cheese darkens too quickly, cover with alu foil
15. Let cool down for a few minutes and enjoy!

Makes 2 large restaurant-sized portions.

# Ingredients

* 8 oz bucatini or spaghetti
* ½ cup whole milk ricotta (heaping)
* 3 to 4 oz prosciutto (use 4 oz for a more loaded dish)
* 1 cup packed baby arugula
* ¼ cup freshly grated parmesan
* 1 lemon, zested and juiced
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Salt

# Notes

* Omit the prosciutto and add a little extra salt to the sauce for a vegetarian option.

# Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400° F 
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Loosely roll up each piece of prosciutto and arrange them on the baking sheet (see progress pictures). Bake until they shrivel and darken in color, about 10 minutes. 
3. Remove the baked prosciutto to a paper towel lined plate. Once cooled, tear into bite sized pieces. 
4. In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, olive oil, parmesan, lemon zest, ¼ tsp black pepper, and 3 tbsp of the lemon juice (discard any extra). Season lightly with salt. 
5. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package directions for al dente. Reserve about ½ cup of pasta water, then drain. Return the pasta to the pot and cover to keep warm. 
6. Add the ricotta mixture to pasta and toss everything together, if the sauce is too thick add the reserved pasta water 1 tbsp at a time until a smooth sauce forms and coats the pasta evenly. Add in most of the prosciutto and arugula and toss further to distribute. 
7. Plate the pasta then top with more fresh cracked pepper and the remaining prosciutto and arugula. Serve immediately.

**Ingredients:**

* 2 yellow onions, peeled and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 1 fennel bulb, cored and thinly sliced into wedges
* 1 tablespoon avocado oil
* 1 teaspoon sugar, optional
* 1/2 cup pistachios, crushed
* .6 ounces sage leaves, divided

* 12 ounces ricotta
* 1 lemon, juiced and zested
* 1-2 tablespoons whole milk, if needed
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Salt and pepper to taste

Method:

1. Caramelize the onion and fennel: Heat avocado oil in a wide pot over medium-low heat. Add the onions and fennel and cook, stirring regularly, for 30-35 minutes until the onions and fennel deepen in color. Season with salt and pepper. You can add a little sugar, if you like them a bit sweeter.

3. Mince the remaining half of the sage and set aside.
4. Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta til al dente. Reserve 3/4 cup pasta water. Drain pasta. *Note: try to time this so that you're draining the pasta right as the onions finish caramelizing.*

na4j9l,Butter poached lobster with a parmesan herb butter linguine!,3086,68,"RECIPE!!

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------

&amp;#x200B;

\* Linguine

\* 

\* Two small or one large lobster tail

\* 

\* 4 sticks of COLD butter for the poach, +3 tablespoons for the sauce

\* 

\* 4 cloves of garlic

\* 

\* 3 Tablespoons of fresh oregano

\* 

\* 3 Tablespoons of fresh parsley

\* 

\* 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan, +more for plating

\* 

\* 3/4 cup of heavy cream

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Linguine noodles boiled in heavily salted water to just about al dente.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

FOR THE LOBSTER

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The lobster was butter poached, so I took about a tablespoon and a half of water, boiled it, reduced the temperature to low and added a clove of smashed garlic and some cracked black pepper, adding a tablespoon of COLD butter and whisking maniacally until just about dissolved and then adding another tablespoon of butter, repeat that, whisking nonstop until all of your butter is melted. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for the nonstop whisking is you're creating a butter emulsification to poach the lobster in. The amount of butter you'll need will vary depending on the amount of lobster you have and the size of your pot. You want the lobster to be fully submerged! 

&amp;#x200B;

The cook time will vary on the size of your lobster tail, so about 5-8 minutes is a safe bet. You don't want to overcook it! 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

FOR THE SAUCE

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Start off with 3 tablespoons of butter on medium low temperature to melt it, add 3 cloves of smashed garlic, let that cook for a few minutes to get that butter all garlicy and junk, add the fresh oregano and parsley and about a cup of the pasta water, bring that to a simmer, add a half a cup of fresh grated parmesan, getting it all melty and delicious, after that's all melted, add 3/4 a cup of cream, bring that to a simmer, add desired amount of pasta to pan, get it all stirred up and junk and let it all get to know each other over medium low heat for about 10 minutes until the sauce thickens up to your desired consistency!

&amp;#x200B;

Plate up and top with some more grated parmesan and some of that delicious lobster poaching butter sauce!

Ingredients


16 Oz. Pasta of choice

Water, for boiling

Lots of salt, for pasta water


1 lb. Ground Beef or Lamb

1 Medium Sweet Onion, diced

6 Garlic Cloves, minced

1 Large Carrot, peeled &amp; grated (fine)

1 28-oz. Can San Marzano Tomatoes

1 Tbsp. Tomato Paste

2 Tbsp. Salted Butter

Oregano, Dried Oregano, Red Pepper Flakes, Salt &amp; Pepper, to taste

Parmesan Cheese &amp; Black Pepper for topping

Steps

Sauce:

1. In a large pan with high sides, (or a dutch oven), melt butter over medium-high heat.

2. Once butter is melted, add diced onion and stir to coat with butter. Add a pinch of salt, cook onion until soft and translucent, stirring semi-frequently, about 5-10 minutes.

3. Once the onion is cooked, add garlic to an open space in the pot and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly browned and fragrant. Once lightly browned, stir together with the onion.

4. Push onion and garlic mixture to the edge of the pan and add the ground beef or lamb. Break up the meat with a wooden spoon, season with more salt, and cook until no pink remains.

5. Once the meat is cooked, reduce the heat to medium then add tomato paste, grated carrot, and canned tomatoes. Stir to fully combine.

6. Add herbs and spices to your liking, (about a teaspoon of each to start), and stir to combine.

7. Allow sauce to simmer, and once the sauce has been reduced slightly, (less watery liquid), turn the heat to low and keep covered while you prepare the pasta. (I recommend lifting the lid occasionally to give a quick stir. Also, taste a small amount of the sauce and adjust the seasoning to your liking, such as adding more salt, pepper, basil, etc.)

Pasta &amp; Assembly:

1. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat.

2. Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add a generous amount of salt and stir to combine.

3. Add pasta and cook al dente according to box directions, stirring occasionally.

4. With about half a minute left in the pasta’s cook time, reserve a small amount, (roughly half a cup), of the pasta water and set it aside.

5. Drain pasta then immediately add to the pan with sauce. Toss to combine. (When combining the pasta and the sauce, slowly drizzle in some of the pasta water to help the sauce bind to the pasta. You don’t need to use all of what you’ve set aside, but it’s better to have too much reserved than too little.)

6. Remove the pan from the heat and serve. Either transfer to a large serving dish or serve into bowls straight from the pan.

7. Top with grated parmesan and a few grinds of black pepper.

8.

* ½ large yellow onion, (cut into half-inch pieces)
* 1 large carrot, (sliced)
* 8 oz baby bella mushrooms, (chopped into half-inch pieces)

* ½ cup water
* 2 ½ Tbsp dijon mustard, \*
* ½ Tbsp agave
* 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
* 2 cups arugula
* sea salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions**

* Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Toss butternut squash, carrots, and onions in 1 Tbsp olive oil. Spread across baking sheet lined with parchment paper and roast until some charring occurs – about 30 minutes.
* Cook noodles according to package instructions in salted water. Once noodles are cooked, strain and rinse with cool water. Then, add to a large bowl and store in refrigerator to cool.
* Add mushrooms and remaining ½ Tbsp olive oil to a skillet. Cook the mushrooms on medium-low until tender – about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Add water, rosemary, dijon, agave, and apple cider vinegar, stirring until combined. Set aside.
* Add roasted vegetables to the large bowl with noodles and continue to chill until ingredients reach room temperature – about 5-10 minutes.
* Add mushrooms and dressing to the noodles and vegetables. Gently toss until combined. You may need to add another tablespoon or so of water to thin out the dressing. Add arugula and salt and pepper to taste. I prefer to serve the pasta salad at room temperature, but if you want it cold, return to the fridge and serve when chilled.

kj42wh,Homemade Italian Tortellini,3889,40,"Tortellini is the most famous italian stuffed pasta and this is the classic recipe to do them at home. The ingredients are simple and genuine, the making of tortellini requires a little time and commitment but the taste worth the effort without doubt.

Fun fact: Legend claims that Tortellini was inspired by the goddess Venus' navel. One evening after a day of battle between Bologna and Modena, Venus, Bacchus and Mars found refreshment at the inn Corona in Castelfranco Emilia. The next morning Mars and Bacchus moved away from the inn leaving Venus dormant;

When she woke up, she called the other companions to hear where they were. the innkeeper came to see if he could help and saw the little-dressed goddess was so impressed by its splendid shapes that he returned to the kitchen and created a pasta inspired by Venus' navel…and so was born the Tortellini.

Video recipe [HERE](https://youtu.be/pM37CxZdXhk)

Serving for about 6 persons

**INGREDIENTS**

For the filling

* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) pork loin
* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) mortadella
* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )
* 150 gr ( 5.29 ounce ) grated parmigiano
* 10 gr ( 0.35 ounce )  butter
* 2 eggs
* nutmeg
* black pepper
* salt

&amp;#x200B;

For the dough

* 320 gr ( 11.29 ounce ) all-purpose  flour
* 80 gr ( 2.82 ounce ) semolina flour
* 4 eggs
* 25 gr ( 0.88 ounce ) extra virgin olive oil
* salt

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTION**

* in a pan put 10 gr butter and 100 gr pork loin diced
* let the pork loin brown well and drain from the excess of butter
* in a meat grinder put the pork loin, 100 gr mortadella and 100 gr cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )
* add to the mixture half nutmeg grated, 150 gr grated parmigiano, black pepper and 2 eggs
* Mix well the mixture and add salt if needed ( you should taste the mixture because the flavor can vary depending on the type of cured ham and mortadella)
* cover with a plastic wrap and let it rest for 2 hours

Now let's prepare the homemade pasta as usual so 1 egg every 100 gr flours. For the flours we will use all-purpose and semolina flour in a proportion 4 to 1 so for this filling about 320 gr all-purpose and 80 gr semolina flour

* Put the flours on a pastry board making a hole in the center where you will put 4 whole eggs and 25 gr extra virgin olive oil.
* With a fork amalgamate the eggs and let the flour be incorporated, salt the dough and continue this operation until it will be possible to work it by hand.
* work the dough until it is smooth and even. Leave it to rest in a film in the fridge for 30 minutes at least.
* work the dough with a rolling pin and divide in several part
* now with the help of a pasta machine begin to lower the thickness of the dough
* the dough will be ready when it is less of one millimetre thick. I usually use the lower setting of thickness
* now cut the pasta dough to obtain squares 4 cm long, i use a pasta cutter to obtain several squares at the time and speed up the process
* Take a pasta square and put a little of filling in the middle then fold the square into a triangle. Finally, roll up the triangle and join the angles creating the typical shape of the tortellini like you can see in the video
* if the pasta dries too much you can moisten the edges of the dough square with a finger wetted in a little water. this will help to seal the tortellini.
* Put the tortellini on a tray lined with parchment paper. If you want you can also frozen tortellini, to do so put the tray in freezer a few hours, in this way they will remain intact and will not stick during freezing, when the tortellini are well frozen you can transfer them in bags to save space in the freezer
* Cook tortellini into boiling beef and poultry stock. If frozen, do not unfreeze.
* You can also prepare tortellini without broth. Cook them in abundant salted water, when they are ready ( 4/5 minutes usually) drain them and season with a heavy cream sauce with ham and peas. If you want more precise instruction for this kind of seasoning ask in the comment section

* 1 pound of rigatoni or ziti
* 1 pound ground sweet Italian sausage
* 1/2 pound 85% lean ground beef
* 24 ounces marinara
* 15 ounces ricotta cheese, transferred to a bowl and stirred to soften
* 8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into bite-sized cubes
* 1/3 + 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese, divided
* 6–7 chopped fresh basil leaves
* salt and pepper, to taste

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 425 °F.
2. Bring a large pot of water with a pinch of salt to a boil. Cook pasta al dente, strain, and transfer to a bowl or back into the boiling pot once it’s cooled. Stir in 1/3 cup parmesan cheese and 1 1/2 cups marinara. Mix and set aside.
3. Meanwhile, bring oil in a large pan or skillet to medium heat. Cook sausage and beef until browned and fully cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Use the tip of your spatula to break the sausage and beef into small chunks. Season with salt and pepper, to taste and set aside.
4. Take half of the pasta and layer filling the entire bottom of a 13X9 casserole dish. Layer with half of the beef and sausage mix, and then half of the ricotta cheese. Spread the ricotta with a rubber spatula, doing your best to spread thinly and evenly. It will tend to stick. It’s best to work in small dollops and spread as best you can. **It does not need to be perfect!**
5. Repeat step 4 with the remaining ingredients. Pasta, sausage/beef, then ricotta.
6. Layer top with 1 cup of marinara. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15 minutes uncovered. Remove from the oven, top with a layer of 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and all the fresh mozzarella. Bake for 20-25 additional minutes or until cheese is fully melted and starting to turn golden. Sometimes a 2-minute broil at the very end will help deliver a perfect golden singe.
7. Let cool for 10 minutes, top with basil, and serve cut in squares

* 1/2 cup tomato paste (about 4.5 ounces)
* 1 shallot, finely chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, minced 
* 3 tablespoons vodka
* 2 tablespoons butter

* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 3–4 chopped fresh basil leaves, for garnish

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta until al dente. **Reserve 2 cups of pasta water before draining and set aside.**
2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter with olive oil. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for about 4 minutes or until very tender. Do not burn!
3. Add tomato paste, red pepper flakes, and vodka. Stir until paste fully coats the shallots and garlic. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Add **1 cup** of pasta water. Stir until smooth. Bring sauce to a simmer, add cream, and turn off the heat. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Fold in the pasta until fully coated in the sauce. Add parmesan cheese and continue to toss/mix.
5. Add additional reserved pasta water as needed (a little at a time) if the sauce is too thick. I like a creamy sauce that is just thick enough to really coat the pasta without being too runny. **I usually just do 1 cup total.**
6. Serve garnished with more Parmesan and chopped fresh basil.

Equipment

* Large pot
* Colander
* Wide pot

Ingredients

* 1 pound dry sea scallops muscle removed
* ¾ pound large shrimp peeled and deveined, tail removed or left on depending on preference
* 16 ounces dry linguine
* 4 tablespoons butter divided
* 2 teaspoons cooking oil plus more, as needed
* 2 shallots peeled and finely diced
* 1 fennel bulb fronds reserved, bulb cored and finely diced
* 4 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 1 pint cocktail tomatoes halved or quartered, depending on size
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper trimmed and minced
* ½ cup dry white wine
* ½ cup reserved pasta cooking water
* ⅓ cup fresh parsley leaves minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

InstructionsPrepare the Scallops:

* Remove the muscle from the scallops and sprinkle with salt. Put them on a plate and transfer to the refrigerator as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
* Peel and devein the shrimp and pat dry. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the refrigerator.

Start the Pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

Prepare the Seafood:

* Once all of the ingredients have been chopped and diced, prepare the scallops to be sautéed. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a wide pot over high heat.
* Pat the scallops dry thoroughly once more. The dryer the better!

Cook the Scallops:

* Melt 2 tablespoons butter into the wide pot. Once melted and frothy, add the scallops and don’t move until a beautiful crust has formed, about 1 minute 30 seconds. Flip and cook an additional 30 seconds or so. The scallops should be slightly undercooked. Transfer to a plate.
* Pat the shrimp dry once more. Add them to the pot and cook in an even layer for 2-3 minutes until almost cooked through. Transfer to the plate with scallops. Loosely tent with foil as you finish the sauce.

Cook the Pasta:

* Right before beginning the sauce, add the linguine to the boiling water. Cook until al dente and reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.

Cook the Sauce:

* Carefully wipe out the excess butter from the wide pot. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the pot over medium heat. Once melted and frothy, add the finely diced shallot and fennel and cook for 4-5 minutes until softened.
* Add the tomatoes and red Fresno pepper (or crushed red pepper) and season everything with salt and pepper. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the tomatoes begin to soften.
* Turn the heat to high for 1 minute. Pour in the white wine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and boil the sauce for about 5-7 minutes until it reduces. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Finish the Sauce:

* Add the reserved pasta cooking water to the pot. Bring to a boil and cook for 3-4 minutes until reduced. Taste and season again to your preferences. Stir in the minced parsley.

Finish the Seafood Linguine:

* Add the cooked linguine to the pot and toss to coat. Add the seafood and cook for 1-2 minutes more until the shrimp are opaque and the scallops are warmed through. Turn off the heat.

To Serve:

* Divide the pasta and seafood between shallow bowls. Garnish with more parsley and fennel fronds. Enjoy!

100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) butter

40 gr ( 1.41 ounce ) extra virgin olive oil ( evoo )

320 gr (11.29 ounce) rice carnaroli or arborio

250 gr (8.82 ounce ) italian sausage

60 gr (2.12 ounce ) shallot or onion

1.5 liters (3.17 pint ) vegetable broth ( see\* )

50 gr (1.76 ounce ) Parmigiano reggiano

INSTRUCTION

* cut 600 gr pumpkin into small pieces
* in a pot put 50 gr butter and 40 gr evoo
* add 60 gr of finely chopped shallot
* when is browned add the pumpkin
* cook the pumpkin adding a ladle of vegetable broth when is too dry
* After 15 minutes add 250 gr of italian sausage
* keep cooking the pumpkin adding the vegetable stock when needed until is well tender and creamy
* add salt as needed
* in another pan toast 320 gr of rice over high heat until opalescent, turning it often not to burn it, a few minutes will be enough, if you listen carefully to the pot, you will hear it crackle imperceptibly.
* Then blend with a glass of white wine
* when the wine is evaporated add the rice to the pumpkin
* stir the rice and simmer well to mix flavors and prevent rice from sticking
* As soon as the risotto begins to dry, add a ladle of vegetables stock
* Continue the cooking until the rice is ""al dente"", just cooked, ( 15/20 minutes ) adding the vegetables stock when the previous one has been adsorbed
* When the risotto is ready stir 50 gr of butter and 50 gr of parmigiano into it, and season well with salt and pepper

And that's all, you can serve the risotto with a sprinkling of parmigiano, or doing a parmigiano wafer. Obv you can make this recipe vegetarian without the sausage! If you have any question feel free to ask, i help gladly any fellow cook looking for tips \^\_\^

\----------------------------------------------------

\*For the vegetables broth I usually do a classic vegetables broth for the risotto, in this case i've added some pumpkin for more flavour.

I put this vegetables in 2 liters of water and cook for 1.5/2 hours

# Equipment

&amp;#x200B;

* Wide Pot
* Large pot
* Medium Skillet

# Ingredients

**Spicy Rigatoni:**

* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
* 1 sweet onion peeled and sliced into thin wedges
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons capers drained
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper more or less to taste
* 1 cup white wine or chicken stock
* 1 cup chicken stock
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes quartered
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 16 ounces dry rigatoni
* 1 lemon juiced
* 1/2 cup fresh parsley leaves minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Scallops:**

* 1 pound dry-packed sea scallops muscle removed
* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Salt and pepper to taste

# Instructions

Start the Sauce:

* In a wide pot, heat the neutral cooking oil over medium heat until hot. Add the onion and cook for 5-6 minutes until just beginning to soften.
* Add the garlic, capers, and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

Deglaze the Pan:

* Add the white wine and chicken stock and bring to a boil.

Simmer the Sauce:

* Add the cherry tomatoes to the sauce and bring to a boil. Taste and season lightly with salt and pepper. The capers and chicken stock will lend a lot of salt to this recipe, so be careful with salting too heavily. Reduce heat and simmer as you prepare the rest of the meal.

Boil the Pasta:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the rigatoni and cook for about 2-3 minutes under al dente.

Finish the Sauce:

* Pour the heavy cream into the sauce. Scoop out 1/3 cup pasta water from the rigatoni and add it to the sauce. Using a spider strainer, add the slightly undercooked rigatoni directly to the sauce. Bring to a very gentle bubble – not boiling, but slightly above a simmer. And cook for 5-7 minutes more until the sauce is very thick and the pasta is tender. Stir in the lemon juice and minced parsley. Taste and season again to your preference.

Sear the Scallops:

* Pat the scallops dry. Season lightly with salt and pepper and pat dry again.
* Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Melt the butter into the skillet. Once melted and frothy, add the scallops, without overcrowding the pan, and cook for 1-2 minutes until very well seared. Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes more until the scallops are opaque and cooked through.
* Turn off the heat on the scallops and immediately transfer the scallops on top of the pasta in the skillet. Turn off the heat.

To Serve:

* Divide the pasta and scallops between shallow bowls. Garnish with more minced parsley, if desired. Enjoy!

Recipe as follows and a link to a short video of the process below.

**Black Trumpet Tagliatelle**

Ingredients

430 g 00 Flour

20 g dehydrated wild mushroom powder

250 g eggs (beaten before mixing)

\*Portioned for 5 - 6 people

Directions

1. Using a spice grinder (or similar) blitz your dried mushrooms into a very fine powder. Here I’m using black trumpets but you could easily substitute with any other edible wild mushroom.

2. Mix together the mushroom powder and flour into a bowl, and dump out onto your clean work surface.

3. Use your hand to form a well (like a volcano) in the center of the flour.

4. Carefully pour your eggs into the center and begin slowly mixing together with a fork. Gradually, carefully, work your way all around to incorporate the eggs with the flour, without breaking the outer wall.

5. After about 5 - 10 minutes it will start coming together into a shaggy mass. Begin using your hands to knead the dough together. Work diligently for another 5 minutes until it is no longer shaggy.

6. Use the edges of your hands, knuckles, to work the dough until it starts to form a smooth ball. Roll it, applying pressure, into the work surface. Fold it. Roll it again. After about ten minutes it should be a smooth, and ready to rest.

7. Cut the dough into two and wrap each in plastic wrap. Set into the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

8. The following steps revolve around using a pasta attachment on a Kitchenaid - but you could also do this by hand with a rolling pin. Remove one of the dough balls, unwrap, and cut off a portion of the dough. Lightly flour and cover the rest back with plastic. Press gently and form a rectangle.

9. Pass the dough through the sheet pasta attachment at it’s widest setting. If it feels sticky, add a little more flour. Gradually tighten the settings of the pasta attachment, one click at a time, and pass the pasta sheet through until it is light and delicate. For tagliatelle, I normally go to the 6th setting.

10. Allow the sheet of dough (sfoglia) to dry for 2-3 minutes and fold in half. With a knife, trim off irregular edges. Gently fold the dough into about 3 inch folds, over and over until you have a nice compact roll.

11. Using your knife, carefully begin cutting strips of the roll into about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) pieces. With your fingers, unroll each strip and sprinkle with a light coating of semolina. You can make little nests with each batch that is finished. Repeat until all of your dough has transformed unto tagliatelle.

12. Cook right away of store in the fridge covered with a towel.

**Cacio e pepe**

Ingredients

1 1/2 cups freshly grated Pecorino Romano

1 1/2 tsp. of freshly ground black pepper

3 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil

Salt

1.5 cups pasta water

Directions

1. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add a dash of salt.

2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and add in crushed black pepper. Stir until the pepper becomes very fragrant. Turn off the heat.

3. Boil the fresh pasta.

4. Reserve about 1.5 cups of pasta water as the pasta finishes. The starch from the water is why you wouldn’t just use regular water here.

5. Transfer the cooked pasta into the skillet with pepper and oil. Toss until all of the noodles are coated.

6. Add about a cup of pasta water to the noodles and stir. This may feel like a lot but it will all come together when you…

7. Add all of the freshly grated Pecorino to the pasta, and stir very well until the cheese and water form a luxurious creamy coating all over the noodles. Add more pasta water as necessary.

8. Divide the pasta into individual plates and sprinkle on a little more fresh Pecorino. Garnish with basil is optional.

**Ingredients**

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 pound ground chicken
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* Big pinch of crushed red pepper
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced
* 3 ribs celery, trimmed and diced
* 14.5- ounce can diced tomatoes
* 6 cups water or chicken stock, plus more if needed
* 1 teaspoon sugar, more or less, depending on your preference
* 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar; if your balsamic vinegar is very acidic, use 1 tablespoon instead
* 8 ounces whole wheat orzo
* 3 ounces baby spinach, roughly chopped
* ¼ cup fresh parsley, minced; plus a pinch reserved for garnish
* Shredded mozzarella cheese, optional, for serving
* Salt and pepper

**Fry the chicken:**

1. Heat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the ground chicken and cook for 5 minutes. Season with garlic powder, thyme, paprika, a big pinch of crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper. Continue sautéing, breaking up the chicken as it cooks, for 10 minutes until it is cooked through.
2. Transfer to a bowl.

**Cook the vegetables:**

1. Add another teaspoon of olive oil over medium heat if the pot seems dry. Add the mushrooms, onion, and celery. Sauté for 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Return the chicken to the pot. Add the diced tomatoes, 6 cups water, sugar, and balsamic vinegar. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Taste and adjust the seasonings.

**Cook the orzo:**

1. Return the soup to a boil. Add the orzo and cook for 7–8 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking. See note.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Once the orzo is mostly tender, reduce the heat to low. Add the baby spinach and parsley. Simmer for 4–5 minutes until the orzo is tender. Taste and season.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish each bowl with more parsley and a handful of mozzarella on top. Enjoy!

**Notes**

*If you want to avoid pasta swelling in the soup, cook the orzo separately. Serve only what you intend to eat with the soup and store the orzo separately in the refrigerator. You may wish to drizzle it with a touch of extra virgin olive oil before refrigerating to prevent it from sticking.*",1702572534000,0.9702148438,Poultry,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/kgoxcnl7ia6c1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18icvd4/chicken_soup_with_orzo_and_mozzarella/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18icvd4/chicken_soup_with_orzo_and_mozzarella/,Orzo & chickpea soup,189.0,0.4,5.0,6.0,1.0,26.0,8.0,5.0,
18f845w,Chicken and Yellow Split Pea Stew,241,14,"**Chicken broth:**

* 2½ pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and quartered
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 head of garlic, top cut off
* Salt

**Stew**:

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 leek, white part only; trimmed, scrubbed, and sliced into rings
* 4 ribs celery, trimmed and diced
* 1 fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced
* 3 carrots, peeled and diced
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 cup yellow split peas, rinsed and picked over
* 4 cups chicken broth from above
* 5 scallions, trimmed and minced
* 1 lemon, juiced
* Salt and pepper

**Make the broth:**

1. Place the chicken, onion, bay leaf, and head of garlic in a pot. Cover with 6 cups of water. Add more if needed to submerge the chicken fully. Add 2 teaspoons salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes or until the chicken is completely cooked.
2. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a bowl. Transfer the garlic to a small plate.
3. Turn the heat on the broth to medium and continue simmering until it reduces and deepens in color, about 10–15 minutes. Reduce the liquid to about 4 cups. It’s okay if you have a little more or a little less.
4. Strain the broth through a fine mesh sieve into a large bowl. Discard solids. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.

**Prepare the chicken and garlic:**

1. Carefully pick the chicken from the bones. Shred the chicken and set it aside. You can freeze the bones for stock if you like. You can fry the chicken skin for a crunchy garnish or discard it.
2. Pop the garlic cloves from the paper and mash them into a paste with a fork. Set aside.

**Make the stew:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the leek, celery, fennel, carrots, and sauté for 10–15 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed to prevent them from burning. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Add the dry thyme, garlic paste, and yellow split peas to the pot. Toss to coat and cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt.

**Simmer the stew:**

1. Pour in 4 cups of broth and shredded chicken. See note.
2. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer uncovered for 30–45 minutes or until the yellow split peas are very tender. Cook for 30 minutes if you prefer a firmer split pea; longer if you prefer a creamier texture. Stir occasionally and gently mash the split peas, adding more water if the broth evaporates too quickly. Taste and add salt and pepper.

**Finish the stew:**

1. Once the stew is thick and creamy, stir in half the minced scallions and the lemon juice. Simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the stew into bowls. Garnish with the remaining scallions. Enjoy!

***Note:*** 

*If you have less than 4 cups of broth, add more water to supplement. If you have more, start with 4 cups of broth and add the remaining as needed. You can also add all the broth and simply simmer it a little longer.*",1702228101000,0.9702148438,Poultry,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/83o0uony1i5c1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18f845w/chicken_and_yellow_split_pea_stew/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18f845w/chicken_and_yellow_split_pea_stew/,Pea and ham hock soup,292.0,3.56,11.0,5.0,4.0,23.0,26.0,5.0,0.9

* Place the chicken into a large soup pot and cover with 6-8 cups of water. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Add the halved garlic head and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes until chicken is completely cooked through and falling off the bone. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl to cool. Remove the garlic and transfer to a plate to cool.
* Bring the broth back to a boil for 15 minutes until it reduces down a bit. (Note: you can skip this step, but I like a very rich, reduced broth).
* Strain the broth into a bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.
* Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat and discard the skin and carcass.
* Pop the garlic cloves out of the paper and discard the paper. With a fork, mash the cloves into a paste and set aside.

**Prepare the Chicken Verde Soup:**

* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the sliced yellow onion and cook for 5 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic paste and cook for 45 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.
* Pour in reserved chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the cilantro, scallions, jalapeño, and shredded chicken. Reduce heat and cook for 15 minutes or until the onion is very soft and the broth is aromatic. Taste and season to your preferences. Add more water if needed. Turn off the heat.

**To Serve**

* Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the reserved cilantro, scallions and avocado. Squeeze lime juice over each bowl. Enjoy!

15c8tlc,Turkey Meatballs with Sun-Dried Tomato Sauce,400,13,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Italian Turkey Meatballs**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/italian-turkey-meatballs/)

**Meatballs:**

* ¼ cup heavy cream
* 1 egg
* ½ cup panko, plus more as needed
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* Big pinch of crushed red pepper
* ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
* 1 pound ground turkey
* Salt and pepper
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, for frying; plus more if needed

**Sauce:**

* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* ½ cup sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* Crushed red pepper, to taste
* ½ cup water or chicken broth
* 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
* Pinch of sugar
* 15 basil leaves, torn; plus more for serving
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Cooked pasta

**Make the meatballs:**

1. In a bowl, whisk together the cream and egg until smooth.
2. Add ½ cup panko, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, a big pinch of crushed red pepper, and the Parmesan cheese. Mix until combined and add a pinch of salt and pepper.
3. Add the turkey to the bowl and season with salt and pepper. Use your hands to mix until combined, adding more panko as needed. The mixture should hold together but still be moist and not too firm.
4. Heat the olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add a tiny drop of the meatball mixture and fry until cooked through. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Reduce the heat on the pot to low while you roll the meatballs.
5. Roll the mixture into 2-inch balls; you should have about 12 meatballs. If you prefer smaller meatballs, roll them into tablespoon-sized balls, and you should have about 20 meatballs.

**Fry the meatballs:**

1. Return the heat on the pot to medium. Add the meatballs in an even layer and cook without moving for 3–4 minutes per side until browned all over. Depending on the size of your pot, you may need to cook them in batches. Transfer the meatballs to a plate. They need not be cooked through at this stage.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. If the pot is dry, add another teaspoon or two of oil and turn the heat to medium heat. Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and diced onion and cook for 10 minutes until softened. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.
2. Pour in the water or broth and scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and add the tomatoes and salt and a pinch of sugar. Bring the tomatoes to a boil and add the meatballs. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
3. Remove the lid and check the temperature of the meatballs. Once they reach 165ºF, transfer them to a plate and scatter 5 fresh basil leaves on top of the meatballs along with a pinch more Parmesan cheese.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Tear the remaining basil leaves and add them to the sauce with the cooked pasta and toss to coat. Taste and season.

**To serve:**

1. Serve the sauced pasta at the table with the platter of turkey meatballs.

156rkmh,Chicken Katsu Udon Soup,583,13,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Chicken Katsu Udon Recipe**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/chicken-katsu-udon-soup-recipe/)

Some people have asked why i didn't make the katsu sauce...I was replicating this off a soup i used to get at a local restaurant and they never served with the katsu sauce. i like the pairing of the crispy chicken with the light broth... if you like the sauce, you can definitely serve it on top!

**Udon:**

* 4 scallions, white and light green parts kept separate
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced
* 2 teaspoons minced ginger
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 5 cups water
* 2 teaspoons dashi granules
* ¼ cup light soy sauce, more to taste
* 2 tablespoons mirin
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil, divided
* 16 ounces frozen or dry udon
* 10 ounces broccoli florets
* 2 teaspoons sesame seeds
* Salt

**Chicken:**

* 1 pound thin-sliced chicken breasts
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon white pepper
* 1–2 teaspoons shichimi togarashi
* 4 eggs
* 2 cups panko
* Salt and pepper
* Vegetable oil for frying

**Prepare the scallions:**

1. Mince the white parts of the scallions and set them aside. Thinly slice the green parts on a steep bias and transfer them to a small bowl. Set aside.

**Prepare the broth:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and mushrooms and cook for 6–8 minutes. Season lightly with salt.
2. Add the ginger, garlic, and minced white parts of the scallions. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
3. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add the dashi granules, soy sauce, mirin, and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Simmer as you prepare the chicken and noodles.

**Cook the noodles:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the udon and cook according to package instructions. Drain and rinse. Divide the noodles between bowls.

**Dredge the chicken:**

1. Heat 1½ inch of oil in a medium-sized pot until it reaches 350ºF. Test the oil temperature with an instant-read thermometer. Adjust the heat as needed between medium-low and medium-high to keep a consistent temperature for frying.
2. Prepare your dredging station by setting out three large shallow bowls. Add the flour, white pepper, and shichimi togarashi to the first bowl. Use 1 teaspoon shichimi togarashi for a subtle heat or 2 teaspoons for spicier undertones in the breading.
3. Crack the eggs into the second bowl and whisk with a fork until well beaten.
4. In the third bowl, add the panko and a pinch of salt.
5. Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.
6. Dip one piece of chicken into the flour until fully coated. Shake off the excess and then dip it into the beaten eggs. Ensure the chicken is completely coated with eggs. Allow any excess to drip off and then dip into the panko. Use your fingers to press the panko into each piece of chicken evenly. Transfer to a wire rack and continue on until all the chicken is breaded.
7. Fry the chicken in batches for 3–4 minutes per side or until the chicken registers 165ºF. Transfer to a wire rack to allow the excess oil to drip off, and continue until the chicken is fried.

*Note: As you add chicken to the oil, it can bring the temperature of the oil down. Continue to check the temperature of the oil and adjust the heat periodically to keep it around 350ºF.*

**Finish the udon:**

1. Turn the heat on the broth to medium-high. Once it bubbles, add the broccoli florets, cook until bright green and tender-crisp, and immediately turn off the heat. Taste and season the broth.

**Prepare the garnish:**

1. Right before serving, drizzle the reserved scallion greens with the remaining 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and the sesame seeds. Toss to coat.

**To serve:**

1. Thinly slice the chicken cross-wise. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and place a sliced chicken breast on top of each bowl. Add a spoonful of the scallion green garnish to each bowl, and enjoy!",1690054352000,0.9799804688,Poultry,BushyEyes,https://i.redd.it/b408ph7g8kdb1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/156rkmh/chicken_katsu_udon_soup/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/156rkmh/chicken_katsu_udon_soup/,Udon noodle soup,124.0,1.9,4.0,8.0,0.0,17.0,5.0,3.0,0.86
14kl7l6,Ground Turkey and Sun-Dried Tomato Ragù,645,16,"**Recipe here originally: [Ground Turkey and Sun-Dried Tomato Ragù](https://newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com/p/recipe-for-the-week-c65)**

I use green bell pepper in this ragù because I like the sharper flavor it adds in contrast to the sun-dried tomatoes. If you prefer sweeter peppers, use red or orange bell peppers, or try it with one green and one red bell pepper for a mix. If you’re not a fan of ground turkey, make this with pork or beef instead.

Cook time: 55 minutes | Serves: 5

* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 pound ground turkey
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and small-diced
* 1 green bell pepper, trimmed, seeded, and small-diced
* ¼ cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, chopped
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, divided; plus more to taste
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* Crushed red pepper, to taste
* ¼ cup water
* 14.5-ounce can fire-roasted crushed tomatoes
* ½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, divided
* 16 ounces mezzi rigatoni or another tubular pasta of choice
* Fresh basil leaves, for serving
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Cook the turkey:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the turkey and season all over with salt, pepper, and half the Italian seasoning. Cook for 12–15 minutes, breaking it up as it cooks, until well-browned and cooked through. Add more salt, if needed.
2. Transfer the cooked turkey to a bowl.

**Cook the aromatics:**

1. If the pot is dry, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and turn the heat back to medium. Add the diced onion, bell pepper, and sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 5–7 minutes until the onion and peppers soften. Season with salt.
2. Melt the butter into the pot and add the remaining Italian seasoning along with the garlic powder, paprika, and crushed red pepper to taste. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the ragù:**

1. Return the turkey to the pot and cook for 1–2 minutes.
2. Pour in the water and crushed tomatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes until thickened. Taste and add more salt or Italian seasoning if needed. Stir the ragù occasionally to prevent it from sticking.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add plenty of salt. Cook the pasta according to package instructions. Scoop out ½ cup of the pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta.

**Finish the ragù:**

1. Taste the ragù and season once more to your preferences. Add all but a few pinches of the Parmesan along with half the pasta cooking water. Stir until the cheese melts into the sauce.
2. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat for 1–2 minutes, adding the remaining pasta cooking water if needed. Once the pasta is glossy and well-coated, turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the pasta onto a large serving platter and sprinkle the remaining Parmesan on top.

12iutek,Duck Dumplings,811,12,"**Recipe here originally: [Duck Dumplings](https://newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com/p/your-next-weekend-cooking-project)**

I based this recipe off my duck egg roll recipe which I've made several times now, and it's always a huge hit. I made a few modifications to the filling based on ingredients I had readily available, but the filling is fantastic, with or without mushrooms.

You can also use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store - just make sure you finely chop it.

**Roast duck:**

* 4–5 pound duck; giblets, neck, and feet reserved for another use
* 1 orange, quartered
* Salt and pepper

**Filling:**

* 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and minced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 3 scallions, trimmed and minced
* 2 Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced
* 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
* 2 tablespoons thin soy sauce
* 1–2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce, optional, to taste
* ½ orange, juiced
* Salt, if needed

**Dumplings:**

* 24–28 dumpling wrappers
* Sliced scallion greens, optional, for garnish
* Water

**Sauce:**

* ⅓ cup black vinegar
* 1–2 teaspoons chili oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds

**Prepare the duck:**

1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF.
2. Line a roasting pan with foil. Place a raised rack in the pan and set aside.
3. Pat the duck dry and season it all over with salt and pepper.
4. Stuff the cavity with the orange wedges. Truss the legs with kitchen twine.

**Roast the duck:**

1. Place the duck on top of the raised rack and transfer it to the oven for 2 hours.
2. Remove the duck from the oven. Using a sharp knife, create a few shallow slits in the skin across the breast and around the thighs. This will allow the fat to fully render. Be careful not to cut the meat too much. You just need 6–8 slits all over the duck, particularly around the fatty area of the legs and breasts.
3. Return the duck to the oven for 1 hour.
4. Remove the duck from the oven and let cool as you prepare the filling.

**Prepare the filling:**

1. Gather the minced ginger, garlic, scallions, and Thai chili peppers in a bowl. Add the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, orange juice, and sweet chili sauce if you like.

**Shred the duck:**

1. Once the duck is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones. Avoid any meat that feels very sinewy. You can keep as much of the crispy skin as you like for the dumplings, particularly the skin around the breasts, thighs, and legs. I discard the skin on the back of the duck. Reserve the carcass for stock, if you like.
2. Place the meat and skin on a cutting board and finely dice. Transfer to the bowl of aromatics and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Your filling is finished, and you're ready to make dumplings!

**Fold the dumplings:**

1. First, get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation.
2. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the dumpling wrapper.
3. Wet the edges with water and fold the dumpling in half. Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling closed into a half-moon shape.
4. You can crimp and pinch the edges as you seal it, but it takes practice!

**Steam, pan-fry, or deep fry the dumplings:**

1. To steam: fill your steamer pot with water and place the rack on top. Place a liner on top. Bring the water to a boil and arrange the dumplings on top. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and steam for 10 minutes.
2. To pan-fry: Dip the bottoms of the dumplings into the water just to coat the bottom, then dip into a bowl of sesame seeds to evenly coat the bottom. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high. Add the dumplings, sesame seed side down, and cook without moving for 1 minute. Pour in ¼ cup water and cover immediately. Cook for 3–4 minutes. Remove the lid and fry for an additional minute or so.
3. To deep-fry: Heat a few inches of oil in a large pot until the oil reaches 330ºF. Add dumplings in batches and deep-fry for 3–4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

**To serve:**

1. Make the sauce by whisking together the black vinegar, chili oil, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. Place the sauce in a small bowl in the middle of a serving platter. Arrange the dumplings around the sauce and garnish with sliced scallions.

12blose,Duck Breast with Mushrooms and Pearl Onions,2204,26,"**Recipe + more photos here originally:** [**My Favorite Duck Breast Recipe**](https://newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com/p/my-favorite-duck-breast-recipe)

**A quick tip:**

Typically, you need to only boil pearl onions for 2 minutes. I go a little longer to soften them a bit more so I don't have to sauté them quite as long since you're holding the duck. BUT! If you don't mind dirtying another skillet, feel free to start those mushrooms and onions in a separate skillet as you cook the duck.

Seared duck breast:

* 1 duck breast (1 pound)
* Salt and pepper to taste

Mushrooms and pearl onions:

* 8 ounces gold or white pearl onions
* 12 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons reserved duck fat
* 3 sprigs thyme
* 4 garlic cloves peeled and thinly sliced
* 1 tablespoon freshly minced parsley, plus more for garnish
* Salt and pepper to taste

Sweet potato puree:

* 2 sweet potatoes, about 1 pound, peeled and cubed
* 2 tablespoons butter
* ½ cup whole milk plus more, if needed
* 2 tablespoons sour cream
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper flakes or paprika and a pinch of crushed red pepper
* Salt and pepper to taste

Parboil and peel the pearl onions:

1. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the pearl onions (skins on) and boil for 5 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl of ice-cold water using a slotted spoon.
2. Once the onions are cool enough to handle, carefully cut off the root end of the onion with sharp scissors. Pop the onion out from its skin. Continue on until all the onions are peeled. Discard the skins.

Cook the sweet potatoes:

1. Dump out the water from the pot and add the sweet potatoes. Cover with fresh water and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20 minutes until fork-tender.
2. Turn off the heat. Pour the potatoes into a colander and return the pot to the same burner. Allow the potatoes to dry off for 1 minute using the residual heat from the warm burner.
3. Add the butter, milk, sour cream, garlic powder, and pepper flakes to the potatoes.
4. Using an immersion blender, blend until creamy and smooth, adding more milk if needed. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder or pepper flakes. Set aside and keep warm.

Cook the duck:

1. Pat the duck dry breast dry. Using a sharp paring knife, score the skin at an angle in ⅛-inch increments until the skin has been completely scored from edge to edge. Be careful not to pierce or cut into the flesh of the duck.
2. Place the duck, skin-side down, into a skillet. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 7 minutes or until the fat begins to render out. Adjust the heat periodically as it cooks. You want to stay somewhere between medium and medium-low.
3. If your duck breast is unevenly fatty (for example, the ends may have a thicker fat layer than the middle of the breast), use a small cast-iron press or skillet or a metal flipper to press that part of the duck into the skillet to encourage even browning.
4. After 7 minutes, get the heat back to medium or just slightly above. The fat in the skillet may begin bubbling and sputtering a bit more rapidly. Check the skin and continue frying and adjusting the heat until the skin is deep golden brown and crisp. This may take another 6–8 minutes. Just keep adjusting the heat and peeking at the skin.
5. Flip the duck and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until desired internal temperature is met. For medium-rare, cook the duck to about 130ºF at the thickest part of the breast. Note: Do not take the temperature of the duck through the skin. Pierce the flesh in order to get an accurate temperature read. I prefer to cook the duck until it reaches 135ºF.
6. Transfer the duck to a plate and cover it tightly with foil. Set aside to rest as you finish the rest of the recipe.

Fry the mushrooms and onions:

1. Drain all the duck fat into a heat-proof jar through a small sieve. Wipe out the skillet and place it on the stove over medium heat.
2. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes until the mushrooms begin to sweat and take on a bit of color.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved duck fat, pearl onions, and thyme sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes until the pearl onions are fork-tender and golden around the edges.
4. Stir in the minced garlic and fresh parsley and sauté for 1 minute. Turn off the heat.

To serve:

1. Right before serving, remove the foil from the duck and slice it crosswise.
2. Spoon the sweet potatoes into a rimmed plate and pile on the mushrooms and onions. Arrange a few slices of duck on each plate. Garnish with more parsley and Aleppo pepper flakes if you like.

**Cooking Tips for Massaman Curry:**

Use high-quality ingredients - Massaman curry relies on the flavour of the curry paste, so make sure to use a good-quality one.

Toast the spices - Toasting the spices, such as cinnamon, cumin, and coriander, before adding them to the curry will enhance their flavour and aroma.

Brown the meat - If you're using meat, such as beef or chicken, brown it first to seal in the juices and enhance the flavour.

Use coconut cream - Coconut cream is richer and thicker than coconut milk, and it gives the curry a creamy texture and flavour.

Add peanuts - Traditional massaman curry often includes peanuts, which add a crunchy texture and nutty flavour to the dish. You can also use cashews or almonds.

Don't overcook the vegetables - To retain their texture and nutrients, don't overcook the vegetables. Add them towards the end of cooking and cook just until they're tender.

Adjust the seasoning - Taste the curry as you cook it and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may need to add more salt, sugar, or fish sauce to balance the flavours.",1678472479000,0.9799804688,Poultry,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/im7yhtuueyma1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11nwlxk/chicken_massaman_curry/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11nwlxk/chicken_massaman_curry/,Beef massaman curry,734.0,1.87,46.0,13.0,21.0,38.0,44.0,3.0,0.9

* 2 teaspoons orange zest
* 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 4 tablespoons light brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon chili oil, optional
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch

**Chicken:**

* 2–3 tablespoons neutral oil
* 1½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized cubes
* 3 tablespoons cornstarch
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon white pepper

**Aromatics:**

* 2 teaspoons neutral oil, as needed, divided
* 6 ounces shiitake mushrooms, caps sliced and stems discarded
* 2 teaspoons freshly minced ginger
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2–3 bird’s eye chilies, trimmed and minced
* 2 scallions, minced

**Prepare all the ingredients:**

1. Before beginning, prepare all of the fresh ingredients and have them ready

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Place all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl and whisk until the cornstarch is completely incorporated into the liquid and no lumps remain. Set aside.

**Prepare the chicken:**

1. Place a skillet on the stovetop over medium heat. Add the neutral oil and allow it to heat as you prepare the chicken.
2. Put the diced chicken in a bowl and season it with salt and white pepper. Sprinkle the cornstarch on top and use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to mix until all the chicken is coated.
3. Turn the heat on the skillet to medium-high. Once the oil is hot and shimmering in the skillet, arrange a batch of the chicken in an even layer, ensuring that the chicken isn’t crowded.

1. **Trim fat and cut to size.** This is an optional step. Trim some of the fat off the chicken thighs. If you prefer a juicier fried chicken you can leave it on. Cut the chicken thighs into 1-inch pieces.
2. **Marinade.** In a medium bowl combine the chicken thigh pieces, five spice, light soy sauce, minced garlic, white pepper, black pepper, salt, sesame oil, sugar, egg white and Shaoxing cooking wine. Mix until all the chicken thigh pieces are well coated. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour. Overnight is recommended so the flavor is absorbed into the meat.
3. **Combine the seasoning powder.** Combine the five-spice, salt, white pepper and Sichuan peppercorns. Set aside.
4. **Coat the chicken thighs.** Combine the cornstarch and potato or tapioca starch on a shallow plate. Dredge the marinaded chicken thighs. Be generous with coating the pieces so you can get an extra crispy piece when fried.
5. **Heat the oil.** Take a pan and add the oil and bring it to 350 Degrees F. I leave it at medium-high heat.
6. **Deep fry.** In small batches add the pieces slowly without splashing the oil. Do not overcrowd or your chicken will not crisp up resulting in limp and super oily popcorn chicken. Fry for 4-5 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Removed with a slotted spoon and let the oil drip. Either use a paper towel or a rack to let it cool. Repeat this 2-3 times.
7. **Double fry (Optional Step).** Once all the chicken pieces have been deep fry. Double fry to get a crispier chicken. Toss the chicken in the batch and deep fry for 2 minutes. Do not overcook otherwise it may burn.
8. **Deep fry Thai Basil.** Take the basil and toss it into the hot oil. Deep fry for 15-20 seconds or until they are crispy and still green. Remove with a slotted spoon and place them on top of a paper towel to absorb most of the oil.
9. **Coat with seasoning powder.** Toss the fried popcorn chicken in a large bowl and coat them with the seasoning powder. Add as much or as little of the seasoning mix.
10. **Plate and top with fried Thai basil.** Plate the fried chicken and top it with the fried thai basil.

* Prep Time: 20 minutes
* Cook Time: 35 minutes
* Inactive time: 1 hour
* Total Time: 1 hour 50 minutes
* Servings: 6
* Calories: 451kcal

**Ingredients:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 3 carrots, peeled and diced
* 8 ounces button mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon dry oregano
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 10-ounce jar roasted red peppers, drained and sliced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* ½ cup red wine
* 14.5- ounce can cherry or whole peeled tomatoes
* 28- ounce can crushed tomatoes
* ½ cup chicken stock or water
* Pinch of sugar, optional
* 6- ounce jar pitted Castelvetrano olives, drained and torn in half
* 8-ounce ball fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced into rounds
* Extra virgin olive oil
* Salt and pepper to taste
* For serving:
* Cooked pappardelle pasta
* Minced parsley

**Instructions:**

**Fry the chicken:**

1. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Heat the 1 tablespoon of neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the chicken thighs, in batches if needed, skin-side down. Cook without moving for 5 minutes or until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the bottom of the pot. Flip and cook for 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Keep the pot on medium-high heat.

**Cook the aromatics:**

1. Add the diced onion, carrots, and sliced mushrooms to the pot. Cook, stirring regularly, for 8–10 minutes. Season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Melt the butter into the pot and add the garlic, dry thyme, dry oregano, and crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the red bell peppers and cook for 1 minute.

**Brown the tomato paste:**

1. Add the tomato paste to the pot. Cook, stirring and mashing the paste into the pot, for 3–4 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium as needed to prevent it from burning. The paste will sizzle, deepen in color, and stick to the bottom of the pot.
2. Pour the wine into the pot and bring it to a boil. Stir to lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot.

**Simmer the sauce:**

1. Add both cans of tomatoes along with the chicken stock or water. Add a pinch of sugar if you like. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, taste the sauce, and add a pinch of salt and pepper if needed. Add the chicken to the pot, spooning the sauce so that it completely covers the chicken.
2. Cover the pot and simmer on low heat for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to ensure that the sauce isn't sticking.
3. After 30 minutes, remove the lid and add the torn olives, stirring them into the sauce. Cover and simmer for an additional 10–20 minutes.

**Finish the chicken cacciatore:**

1. Turn on the broiler. Remove the lid from the pot. Arrange the sliced mozzarella on top and drizzle with a teaspoon or two of extra virgin olive oil. Transfer to the broiler for 2–4 minutes or until the cheese is browned and bubbly. Turn off the broiler and remove the pot from the oven.

**To serve:**

1. Sprinkle the chicken and sauce with freshly minced parsley. Serve with pasta or crusty bread. Enjoy!

Original Recipe: [https://craftycookbook.com/coconut-lime-chicken-pasta/](https://craftycookbook.com/coconut-lime-chicken-pasta/)

**Ingredients**

* 1 large chicken breast, \~12-16 oz
* 8 oz thin spaghetti or similar
* 2 tbsp coconut oil or olive oil
* 2 tbsp fresh cilantro, for topping
* 1 tsp baking soda, optional, for tenderizing
* salt
* black pepper

*For Sauce*

* 1 13.5 oz can lite coconut milk, unsweetened (\~1 ½ cup)
* ¼ cup fresh lime juice, juice of 1 large or 2 small limes
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 1 tsp chicken better than bouillon or 1 chicken bouillon cube
* 1 tbsp cornstarch
* 1/4 tsp black pepper

**Instructions**

1. Fillet the chicken breast and pound the pieces to an even thickness. \[Optionally, tenderize the chicken with baking soda. Dust the baking soda lightly over both sides of the fillets. Let sit for 15 minutes, then rinse off all the baking soda and pat dry with paper towels.\] Season the chicken all over with salt and black pepper.
2. Mix together the sauce ingredients and set aside.
3. Begin boiling a large pot of salted water for the pasta as you prep other ingredients. Boil pasta per package instructions for al dente, then drain a set aside, keep covered. (I typically add the pasta to the water during step 5)
4. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté the chicken until each side has some browning and the chicken is cooked through or mostly cooked through, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken to a cutting board.
5. Carefully wipe the skillet clean of excess oil, then add the coconut milk mixture. Once it’s boiling reduce heat to medium low, add the chicken back to the pan let simmer for \~5 minutes, occasionally spooning the sauce over the chicken. Remove the chicken back to the cutting board and ensure it’s cooked through. Allow the chicken to rest, and continue to reduce the sauce until it’s thick enough that a spatula pushed through the sauce briefly leaves streaks in the pan, about 5 minutes.
6. Once the sauce is ready, remove from heat and reserve about 2 tbsp (for topping the chicken). Toss the pasta in the remainder of the sauce. Plate the pasta, and top with the chicken sliced into bite sized pieces. Top the chicken with the remaining sauce and garnish the whole dish with the cilantro.

wv34xx,Spicy Feta Chicken w/ Lemon Rice,1118,40,"# Spicy Feta Chicken with Lemon Rice

Tender shredded chicken coated in incredibly flavorful spicy feta sauce, paired with tangy lemon rice. (Note, this is not authentic Greek lemon rice)

Time: 40 mins

**Ingredients**

* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast
* ⅔ cup chicken stock
* olive oil
* salt
* fresh cracked black pepper
* red pepper flakes, optional, for topping
* \~1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, optional, for topping

*For Feta Sauce:*

* 4 oz feta
* 1 small shallot, chopped
* ¼ cup roasted red bell peppers, chopped (I use jarred peppers)
* ½ tbsp freshly minced garlic
* ½ tbsp red wine vinegar
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp chicken stock or water
* ¼ tsp cayenne powder + more to taste
* ⅛ tsp salt
* ⅛ tsp black pepper

*For Lemon Rice:*

* 2 cups jasmine rice
* 3 cups chicken stock
* 2 large lemons zested and juiced
* 2 tbsp butter
* salt to taste

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions - Spicy Feta Chicken**

1. Trim any excess fat and gently pound the chicken breast(s) to an even thickness. Season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Warm a drizzle of olive oil over medium-high heat in a pan that has a lid. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken and cook for about 3 minutes per side until golden. Add the ⅔ cup chicken stock to the pan and close with the lid. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for another \~10 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked through.
3. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Combine the spicy feta sauce ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. Taste and add more cayenne to make it as spicy as you’d like (if you are very sensitive to spice, start with ⅛ tsp rather than ¼ tsp cayenne or omit completely).
4. When the chicken is ready, allow it to rest for a few minutes then shred it (I use two forks to shred chicken breast). Toss the chicken in the sauce until its fully coated, you may not want to use all the sauce so add a little at a time.
5. Optionally, top with red pepper flakes and/or fresh thyme when serving.

**Instructions - Lemon Rice**

1. Thoroughly rinse the rice until the water runs clear (even if the rice says “pre-washed”). In a medium stockpot combine the rice, chicken stock, and half of the lemon juice.
2. Close the pot with a lid and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes, then reduce the heat to low so the rice is simmering and cook until the water is all gone, about 10 minutes. Set heat to low to keep warm until ready to serve.
3. Before serving, add the lemon zest, the rest of the lemon juice, butter, and a dash of salt. Mix well, then serve.

### Instructions

#### Make the meatballs:

* Mix together the egg and milk until smooth. Add the panko and stir to combine. Let stand 5 minutes. Add the turkey and all the spices. Mix together with your hands until combined. If the mixture is too loose, add more panko in 1/4 cup increments. The mixture should be sticky, but rollable.
* Tip: Microwave or fry up a small piece of the mixture and taste a bit and then adjust the seasonings before rolling the meatballs.
* Roll the meatballs into tablespoon-sized balls.
* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a deep skillet. Add the meatballs in an even layer and fry for 2–3 minutes per side. Continue turning until browned all over. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover loosely with foil, and simmer for 15–20 minutes or until cooked through. Once the meatballs are cooked through, turn off the heat and keep warm.

#### Prepare the saffron rice:

* Place the basmati rice in a sieve and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear.
* Place half a pinch of saffron in a bowl and use the back of a spoon to crush it. Add the remaining threads, leaving them whole, and pour 1/4 cup hot water (it can be hot water from your tap!) over the saffron. Let stand for 5 minutes.
* Place a large pot on the stove over medium-high heat. Add the butter. Once melted, add the diced onion and cook until translucent. Add the rinsed rice and cook 1–2 minutes. Pour the saffron-water mixture on top and then add the remaining water. Season it with salt and then bring to a low boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes or until the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and let the rice rest for 5–10 minutes.

#### Prepare the zucchini-cucumber salad:

* Add the diced zucchini, cucumber, and shallot to a bowl. Add extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and dry dill. Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.

#### Prepare the hummus sauce:

* Whisk together the hummus, lemon juice, and chili flakes until smooth. Taste and add salt if needed. Add a few splashes of water until the hummus reaches drizzling consistency. Set aside.

#### To serve:

* Divide the rice between bowls. Pile the meatballs on top and add a spoonful of salad to each bowl. Serve with a spoonful of the hummus sauce and toasted pita, if you like. Enjoy!

t5y33a,Creamy Chicken Pasta Recipe,1704,23,"**Recipe here originally: [Creamy Chicken Pasta Recipe](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/creamy-chicken-pasta-recipe/)**

This creamy chicken pasta recipe is a rich, comforting creamy chicken pasta with vegetables like Brussels sprouts and roasted red bell peppers.

This creamy chicken pasta recipe can be made in a few different ways:

* Raw split chicken breasts that you turn into a homemade chicken stock
* Leftover shredded chicken from a homemade or store-bought roasted chicken
* Raw, boneless chicken that you simply chop up and sauté until cooked through before starting the sauce

For the recipe below, I used raw split chicken breasts that I turned into very simple chicken stock. However, this does add more time to the recipe. If you’re in a pinch and you have leftover shredded chicken already, you can skip the steps for making the stock and move right into the sauce preparation.

**What you need:**

For this recipe, you’ll primarily need chicken, pasta, vegetables, and heavy cream. Take a look at some of my substitution suggestions so you can modify this dish any way you like:

* **Chicken:** Omit for vegetarian. You could also use shrimp but you would skip baking the dish to avoid overcooking them.
* **Brussels sprouts:** Use your favorite vegetables in this meal! Try it with zucchini, broccoli or broccolini, cauliflower florets, eggplant, or use spinach.
* **Roasted red bell peppers:** Chopped sun-dried tomatoes

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 30 minutes

Inactive Time: 1 hour

Total Time: 1 hour 45 minutes 

Servings: 6 

Calories: 762kcal

### Equipment

* Large pot
* Baking sheet
* Wide ovenproof pot
* Sieve
* Tongs

### Ingredients

#### Chicken stock (optional):

* 1 pound bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts
* 1 yellow onion quartered, paper left on
* 1 head of garlic halved, paper left on
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Creamy chicken pasta:

* 16 ounces pasta of your choice like strozzapreti, rigatoni, penne, rotini, or fusilli
* 2 tablespoons neutral oil
* 2 red bell peppers trimmed, seeded, and quartered
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 1 pound Brussels sprouts halved
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more if desired
* ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
* 1½ cups homemade chicken stock from above or use store-bought stock
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Freshly minced parsley optional, for garnish

### Instructions

#### Prepare the stock:

* Cover split chicken breasts with water and season liberally with salt. Add the quartered onion and halved head of garlic. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 30–40 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Skim off the foam that floats to the top as the chicken cooks.
* Use tongs to transfer the chicken to a plate and let it cool. Bring the stock back to a boil and boil for 15 minutes until significantly reduced. Strain through a sieve into a large bowl and set aside. You will need 1½ cups stock for the recipe, and any extra stock can be saved for another use.
* Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred it with your fingers, two forks, or dice it up. Discard the skin and bones.
* Wipe out the pot used for the stock and fill it back up with salted water and return it to the stovetop. You'll use it for the pasta later on.

#### Broil the red bell peppers:

* While the stock cooks, prepare the red bell peppers. Arrange the prepared peppers on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Place under a broiler and cook for 7–8 minutes until blackened all over. Keep an eye on them, so they don't burn to a crisp!
* Immediately transfer the peppers to a Tupperware dish with a lid or a gallon freezer bag. The trapped steam will help the skins come off easily. Peel the peppers and roughly chop and set aside.
* Turn the broiler off and turn the oven's heat to 400ºF.

#### Cook the pasta:

* Bring the pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until 2 minutes under al dente. Drain and set aside.

#### Cook the vegetables:

* In a wide, oven-proof pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Cook the onion until softened–about 7–10 minutes–and then turn the heat to high. Add the Brussels sprouts and cook for 6 minutes until well-charred. Add the chopped red peppers and cook for 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl.

#### Prepare the sauce:

* Melt the butter in the pot over medium heat. Once bubbly, add dry thyme and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add flour to the butter and cook for 2–3 minutes until lightly golden. Slowly whisk in the reserved chicken stock. Bring to a low boil and then reduce heat and continue whisking until completely smooth.
* Stir in the heavy cream and whisk until smooth. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and more crushed red pepper if you like. Turn off the heat.

#### Bake the pasta:

* To the sauce, add the cooked chicken, cooked pasta, and the reserved vegetables and toss to coat and evenly distribute the ingredients. Sprinkle the parmesan cheese on top and transfer to the oven for 10–15 minutes or until the Brussels sprouts are fork-tender and the cheese is melted. If you like, broil for 2–3 minutes to char the top of the pasta.

#### To serve:

* Garnish the pasta with fresh minced parsley and serve immediately. Enjoy!

sxzo02,Chicken Barley Soup with Mushrooms,925,16,"**Recipe here originally: [Chicken Barley Soup Recipe](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/chicken-barley-soup-recipe/)**


**Want to make some substitutions? Here’s my handy guide:**

* **Raw chicken:** In a pinch for time? Use a storebought rotisserie chicken and storebought stock.
* **Carrots, celery, and onions:** Use any combination of aromatics. If you don’t have celery, use more carrots! You can even add lots of freshly minced garlic or even sliced fennel.
* **Mushrooms:** You can omit them or swap with something else you have in your crisper. Try adding a soup green at the end (like escarole, spinach, or arugula) or you can add some frozen veggies at the end like green beans, corn, or peas!
* **Barley:** Use wild rice, farro, farfalle, egg noodles, or pearl couscous. Cooking time will vary!

**Chicken Barley Soup Recipe**

This chicken barley soup recipe is comforting and warming with rich homemade chicken stock, lots of aromatics, and mushrooms.

Calories: 376kcal

## Equipment

* Large stockpot
* Sieve

## Ingredients

## Chicken stock:

* 3- pound whole chicken giblets removed and discarded
* 2 chicken leg quarters optional
* 5 ribs celery with leaves roughly chopped
* 3 carrots scrubbed and cut into thirds
* 1 onion with paper quartered
* 2 dry bay leaves
* 1 bunch parsley torn or cut in half
* Salt and pepper
* Water

## Chicken barley soup:

* 1 tablespoon oil for sautéing
* 7 ounces mushrooms of choice like beech, cremini, or shiitake, sliced or torn depending on variety
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 4 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and diced
* 5 carrots trimmed, peeled, and diced
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 cup pearl barley
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Fresh minced parsley optional, for serving

## Instructions

## Prepare the chicken stock:

* Place the chicken in a big stockpot with celery, carrots, onion, bay leaves, and parsley. Cover with water and season liberally with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 3–4 hours. Skim off any scum or foam that rises to the top. Let the pot cool and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.

## Finish the chicken stock:

* The next day, remove the chicken from the broth and transfer it to a bowl. Strain the stock through a sieve into a big bowl and discard the solids. Pick the chicken from the bones and discard the skin and carcass. Wipe out the stockpot and return it to the stovetop.

## Prepare the chicken barley soup:

* Once your stock is ready to go, prepare the soup. Heat the neutral oil in the stockpot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook for 8–10 minutes. Add the onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring often, for an additional 8–10 minutes.
* Add the dry thyme, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the reserved stock and chicken meat. Add the barley and then bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 30–45 minutes. If needed, supplement the soup with a bit of water or storebought stock, but you likely won’t need it!

## Finish the soup:

* Once the barley is tender, turn off the heat, taste the soup, and season to your preferences.

## To serve:

* Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with more freshly minced parsley, if you like. Enjoy!

3. Score the chicken and rub it with wet and dry ingredients. For the best result do it one day before cooking.
4. Grill the chicken breasts until internal temperature reaches 72C (162F). For chicken legs 82C (180F) plus resting time of minimum of 15 minutes.
5. Serve chicken with fries and Peri-Peri sauce. Enjoy!

This orange-maple roast duck recipe may be time-consuming but it's so unbelievably easy to prepare and tastes incredible.

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 3 hours 30 minutes 

Servings: 4 people

### Equipment

* Sheet pan
* Roasting rack
* Small pot

### Ingredients

* 5-6 pound whole pekin duck; giblets and neck removed 
* Salt pepper
* 8 clementines divided
* 3-4 shallots
* 4 star anise pods
* ½ cup maple syrup
* 1 teaspoon whole-grain mustard
* 1 teaspoon dijon mustard

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Duck:

* Preheat oven to 350ºF.
* Pat the duck dry and use a sharp knife to create angled slits along the breast. Cut into the fatty parts around where the legs meet the body and between the wings and the body. You just want to make enough slits around the fatty part of the duck skin so that the fat renders out.

#### Stuff the Duck:

* Peel the shallots and quarter. Quarter 4 of the clementines. Stuff the duck with the clementines and shallots and tie the legs together. Season the duck liberally with salt and pepper.

#### Roast the Duck:

* Line a baking sheet with foil and place a raised roasting rack on the foil. Place the duck on top and transfer to the oven, breast-side up, for 1 hour.
* Flip the duck and cook, breast-side down, for 1 more hour.
* Remove the duck from the oven. At this point, you can drain off the duck fat and reserve it for another use.
* Roast the duck, breast-side up for 40 minutes more.

#### Prepare the Glaze:

* In a saucepan, combine the juice of the remaining 4 clementines, maple syrup, 4 star anise pods, and 1 teaspoon dijon mustard. Bring to a boil and whisk until smooth. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat.
* Remove the duck from the oven and brush half the glaze over the duck. Return to the oven for 20 more minutes.
* Brush the duck with the remaining glaze and bake for 10 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil for 4-5 minutes until the skin darkens on top, being careful not to burn the sugars in the glaze.
* *Note: You can reserve a few teaspoons of the sauce and spoon it over the duck at service.*

#### To Serve:

* Remove from oven and serve!

Just taste and add ½ cup of water at a time as necessary!*

#### Cook the noodles:

* Taste the broth and adjust the seasonings as necessary. Bring to a boil. Add the noodles and cook for 8–12 minutes or until just al dente.

RECIPE VIDEO LINK - [https://youtu.be/KdF86Mcct1Y](https://youtu.be/KdF86Mcct1Y)

INGREDIENTS: 

1.5 lb chicken (I used with skinless chicken pieces with bones in)  
15 cloves of garlic  
1 inch fresh ginger  
½ cup thick plain yogurt   
2 teaspoons salt   
½ teaspoon sugar  
1 medium size red onion  
1 teaspoon turmeric powder  
1 teaspoon cumin powder   
1/2 teaspoon coriander powder  
1/2 teaspoon chili powder   
2 tablespoon oil  
1 green chili  
1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder   
¼ cup finely chopped cilantro leaves

DIRECTIONS: 

You will use 10 garlic cloves to marinate the chicken. The other 5 will be used while cooking the curry. Grate or pound 10 garlic cloves along with ginger. Slice thinly, the remaining 5 garlic cloves  
   
If you are using chicken drumsticks, make sure to score the meat portion a couple of times.   
In a bowl add the chicken pieces along with yogurt, pounded garlic, ½ teaspoon turmeric and 1 teaspoon salt. Give it a mix nicely to coat all the chicken pieces. Keep it aside for minimum 4 hrs or overnight for maximum flavor blend.   
When you are ready to prepare the chicken curry, place a heavy bottom nonstick pan on the stove at medium heat. Pour the oil along with the sliced garlic, chopped green chili and chopped ginger. As the oil heats up, the garlic will start to sizzle and slowly turn golden brown. Take out some garlic chips to add later in garnish.   
To the wok add the sliced onion. Sprinkle the rest of the salt, sugar and turmeric along with the spices (cumin powder, coriander powder and chili powder). Stir and cook the onion for 3 minutes, or until it’s golden brown.   
Then add the marinated chicken and stir it to incorporate everything. If you are using boneless chicken cubes, it will take 15minutes to cook the chicken. If you use chicken with bones in, then it will take about 20 minutes.   
After 10 minutes of cooking the chicken, it will start to release water. Now depending on how much gravy you want, add water and let it continue cooking.   
Once the chicken is cooked, taste for salt and add any if needed.   
Finally sprinkle finely chopped cilantro leaves, garam masala powder and give it a mix.",1632720302000,0.9799804688,Poultry,playfulcooking,https://i.redd.it/r817f5443zp71.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/pw9nfs/garlic_chicken_curry/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/pw9nfs/garlic_chicken_curry/,Chicken & vegetable curry,618.0,0.9,18.0,20.0,7.0,66.0,49.0,8.0,0.96

Full recipe: [https://www.theflouredcamera.com/korean-fried-chicken-tacos/](https://www.theflouredcamera.com/korean-fried-chicken-tacos/)

# Ingredients

* 1 lb chicken thigh, cubed
* 2 tbsp rice wine or Shaoxing wine
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* ½ inch ginger, minced
* ¼ tsp salt
* Pepper, to taste
* Neutral oil, fill pot for frying  


**Sauce**

* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp rice vinegar
* 1½ tbsp *gochujang*
* 3 tbsp honey
* 2 tsp sesame oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* ½ inch ginger, minced  


**To assemble**

* 6 corn tortillas, sub flour tortillas
* 1 cup Korean coleslaw
* ½ cup kimchi, cut in bite-sized pieces
* Lime
* White sesame seeds, optional
* Kewpie mayo, optional  


# Instructions

1. Make your slaw first and let it sit in the fridge for two hours. Follow my Korean coleslaw recipe.
2. Slice chicken thigh into bite-sized pieces. Marinade in rice wine, salt, pepper, garlic, and ginger for 30 minutes.
3. In a pan, mix ingredients for the sauce on low-medium heat. Allow it to bubble and simmer until thick, keep stirring during the process. This should take about 4-5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit on the side.
4. Coat chicken with corn starch. However, only coat what you will fry immediately. If you let the chicken sit too long in the starch, it will become a sludge.
5. In a shallow pot, add in a neutral flavored oil. Ensure the oil is hot (350° F) before you drop in your chicken. Cook in separate batches. Don't crowd the chicken as it will cause the temperature to drop too quickly and you won't get a nice brown outer layer. Fry each batch for 3 minutes.
6. After each batch, remove chicken with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to absorb some of the oil.
7. Once all the chicken has been fried a first time, put all the chicken back in for a second fry. No need to do this in batches. Fry for about 2 minutes.
8. Heat up the sweet and spicy sauce and add in the fried chicken. Mix well so each piece is evenly coated.
9. Heat up tortillas on a griddle of a pan until softened. Add chicken and top with coleslaw, kimchi, and white sesame seeds (optional). For some creaminess, use a light drizzle of mayo (optional).",1632435963000,0.9799804688,Poultry,parisrosaries,https://i.redd.it/u6vc2uczlbp71.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/pu54i9/korean_fried_chicken_tacos/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/pu54i9/korean_fried_chicken_tacos/,Korean fried chicken burgers,415.0,1.8,20.0,35.0,4.0,38.0,19.0,2.0,0.96

ntjhoy,Chicken Tandoori with Vegetable Biryani &amp; Cucumber Raita,3391,83,"Indian food is so aromatic...  
  
I love the variety of spices used in that cuisine, not to mention their health benefits.  
  
From all the South Asian dishes Chicken Tandoori is definitely one of my favourites, especially when served on fragrant rice like Biryani. Enjoy cooking!  
  
The secret of the best Chicken Tandoori is the meat quality and marinating time.  
  
The longer marinating period the better. It gives the meat enough time to absorb all those beautiful flavours!  
  
Remember to always pick the meat from suppliers that do respect animal welfare, if you cannot afford it try to eat less meat but better sourced.  
  
Making cuts in the meat helps the marinade to penetrate deeper, thus giving a better result.  
  
Serves 3 hungry heads  
  


**Ingredients for Chicken Tandoori:**  
  
3 good quality chicken legs  
  
3 tbsp of natural yoghurt  
  
1/2tsp of salt  
  
half lemon juice and zest  
  
3tsp of garlic and ginger paste  
  
2tbsp of Kashmiri mild chilli powder (if you are not a big fan of spicy food substitute with 2tbsp of paprika)  
  
1tsp of turmeric  
  
1/2tsp ground coriander  
  
1tbsp oil  
  


**Instructions for Chicken Tandoori:**  
  
1.Prepare the chicken by removing the skin and separating the drumstick from the thigh. Next, make three deep cuts on each side of the pieces (This helps marinate to penetrate deeper)  
  
2.Place the chicken in the bowl and rub with 1/2 lemon juice and 1/2tsp of salt.  
  
3.Mix remaining marinade ingredients and rub in the meat.  
  
4.Place in the fridge for 24 hours (2 hours minimum if you in the rush)  
  
5.To cook the chicken, preheat the oven to a 220C fan (428F) setting and place the meat on a flat tray with some baking paper. Once the oven is hot, roast the chicken for 30 minutes on one side, flip to another, and continue on the grill setting for another 10-15 minutes.  
  
6.Rest under foil for 5 minutes before serving.  
  


**Ingredients for Vegetable Biryani:**  
  
300g (10.6oz) of extra long basmati rice  
  
2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil  
  
1 small cinnamon stick  
  
7 cardamom pods  
  
7 cloves  
  
1 star anise  
  
1 medium red onion, sliced  
  
1 large green chilli, seeds removed and sliced  
  
3tsp of garlic and ginger paste  
  
2 small potatoes, small dice  
  
1 medium carrot, sliced  
  
80g (2.8oz) of green beans, sliced  
  
1/2tsp of salt  
  
1tsp garam masala  
  
1/2tsp turmeric  
  
1/2tsp Kashmiri mild chilli powder  
  
1/2tsp ground cumin  
  
5 curry leaves (optional)  
  
3tbsp of natural yoghurt  
  
half lemon juice and zest  
  
550ml (0.6quarts) of vegetable stock

  
  
**Instructions for Biryani:**  
  
1.Soak the washed rice in water for 30-50 minutes.  
  
2.In a large frying pan or a pot, medium heat 2tbsp of ghee and fry aromatics for 2 minutes (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and star anise)  
  
3.Next, add sliced red onion, sliced green chilli and garlic and ginger paste, cook for 5 minutes.  
  
4.Turn up the heat and add 2 diced potatoes, sliced carrot and green beans, season with 1/2tsp of salt and cook until starts to brown (10 minutes)  
  
5.Lower the heat and mix in garam masala, turmeric, mild chilli powder and cumin.  
  
6.Add 5 curry leaves, 3tbsp of natural yoghurt, rice and 550ml of vegetable stock, bring to a boil and reduce to simmer, cover with a lid and continue cooking for around 15 minutes or until rice absorbs all the liquid.  
  
7.Once ready, mix it with a spoon, cover with a lid and rest for another 15 minutes.  
  
8.Your Biryani is ready to be served, drizzle with lemon juice and zest, adjust the saltiness if necessary. Enjoy!  
  


**Ingredients for Cucumber Raita:**  
  
150g (5.3oz) of natural yoghurt  
  
100g (3.5oz) of grated cucumber  
  
half a green chilli, thinly sliced  
  
a handful of coriander  
  
black pepper to garnish  
  


**Instructions for Raita:**  
  
Mix all the ingredients together and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes in the fridge before serving.  
  


**Insight:**  
  
When cooking chicken legs the core temperature should reach 80C (176F) significantly higher than a breast meat 72C (162F)  
  
Remember to rest the meat after cooking, this helps the juices to redistribute in each piece.  
  
Soaking rice helps it to absorb moisture inside each grain. This helps to cook quicker and better.

nan8ux,Prosciutto-wrapped Chicken Roulade with Mushrooms in creamy sauce,3156,73,"Ingredients:

2 large Chicken Breasts

2 Yellow Onions

2 Portobello Mushroom Cups or 6oz of any Mushroom

5 Cloves of Garlic

9oz of Fresh Mozzarella cheese

4 slices of Prosciutto ham

1 cup of Heavy Cream

1/2 cup of White Wine (optional)

Fresh Thyme

[full recipe with pictures here](https://tasteabroad.com/recipe/chicken-roulade-with-mushrooms-in-creamy-sauce/)

1. Prepare chicken breast

Paper dry chicken breast and slice horizontally from the thicker side to a thinner, but stop about 1/2 inches to it. This way you will ""butterfly"" your chicken breast, which is a well-known technique to make thin and large chicken pieces. 

Cover your butterflied chicken breast with a piece of plastic wrap and roll a pin over it to make it even and thinner. Set aside.

2.  Make mushroom stuffing 

Mince 5 cloves of garlic and sauté it in a frying pan over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add finely chopped 2 onions, keep sautéing for another 2 minutes. Add chopped Portobello mushroom caps to the pan and keep cooking stirring occasionally for 5 more minutes or until all water will evaporate from the pan. 

Add a quarter of a cup of dry White Wine, mix well and cook until stuffing gets almost dry. 

At that point add 1 teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, and some fresh minced thyme. Mix well and set aside to cool down.

3. Roll!

Place your chicken with a wide side down and thin side up like on the pictures below. 
Divide mushroom sauce into 3 parts: 2 for each chicken breast and 1 for the cream sauce for later. 

Using a spoon, evenly spread 1 part of mushroom stuffing over the chicken piece, leaving half an inch on each side uncovered. 

Next, lay some thinly sliced fresh mozzarella, keep sides uncovered.

Gently roll chicken working your way from the wider bottom to the thinner top. Do not add too much pressure, as your stuffing will try to escape! We will secure everything in place with a cooking twine in just a second.

Now it is time to wrap our roulade in prosciutto. Here is what I learned the hard way ( meaning one of the roulades on final pictures is an unsuccessful test, but still the same delicious ha!): lay prosciutto slices parallel to your chicken roll, this way it is much easier to cover the whole roulade, which will look so much better when the dish is done!

Twine up! Using a cooking twine (the cotton string will work just fine!) gently wrap your roulade, starting from one side of it with tying a knot and work your way to the other side. Now you can add some pressure to help twine keep roulade`s shape while searing it. 

4. Sear roulade 

Preheat your skillet pan on medium heat. I used skillet mostly because I  wanted to be able to cook my dish both on a stovetop and in the oven, so if you have a suitable frying pan you can stick it into your cooking stove, - use that! Also, I used 2 tablespoons of canola oil to season my pan. 

Add your chicken roulades into a hot pan and sear for 3 minutes on each of 4 sides.  Let it cool down for 5 minutes before proceeding to the final step.

5. Sauce and bake

Gently remove twine by cutting each layer and pulling it.

Finally, pour half a cup of heavy cream into your pan, add a third of the mushroom stuffing left from making roulades, and a little bit more cheese ( at this point you can use any cheese you love but make sure it is great melting one). 

Place pan into the preheated to 370F oven and bake for 20 minutes.

n1ncb8,Thai basil stir fry,1946,61,"Thai basil stir fry recipe:

*Serves ~6 people*

*I eyeballed the ingredient amounts but will try and write approximations.*

Ingredients:

* ~2.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
* ~20 cloves of garlic finely chopped, ground, or minced
* 5-6 stalks worth of basil leaves (use holy basil or regular basil here)
* 1-2 heads of broccoli
* 1 yellow onion
* 1 red bell pepper

* Oyster sauce (~10 tbsp for marinade and another 4 tbsp for stir fry sauce)
* 2 tbsp Hoisin sauce
* 1 tsp Fish sauce
* 1.5 tbsp Light soy sauce
* 1.5 tbsp Dark/sweet soy sauce
* A few pinches of corn starch
* A few pinches of MSG if you have it although I forgot it this time and still tasted great
* 1 tbsp sugar (also optional - the sauces already add some sweetness)

Procedure:

Slice the chicken into strips and then marinate in plenty of oyster sauce for at least 30 min to an hour but the longer the better.  Fry the chicken strips in peanut oil or another good frying oil on medium heat for ~ 5 minutes on each side or until you see the sauce begin to caramelize on the chicken and it's cooked through.  Set your chicken aside and then, if necessary, add a little more oil to the pan and throw in all of your minced garlic.  Turn up the heat here to high and once the garlic starts to brown slightly, throw in all of your chopped-up veggies.  Fry the veggies until you see them start to brown and then turn down the heat to medium-low and throw in all of your sauces along with the chicken.  Throw in the corn starch, MSG, and sugar, give this a good mix, and cook on medium-low for a minute or two.  Finally, kill the heat or turn down to the lowest setting and add in the basil.  Stir the basil around until it gets all saucy and nice.  It's important not to really cook the basil but to let the very low or residual heat and sauce do their work on it while you mix it in.",1619764978000,0.9902343750000001,Poultry,saybrook1,https://i.redd.it/f6zmdgdk09w61.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/n1ncb8/thai_basil_stir_fry/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/n1ncb8/thai_basil_stir_fry/,Thai beef stir-fry,178.0,0.55,10.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,22.0,0.0,0.8800000000000001

📷📷

**Instructions:**

**1.** In the slow-cooker on high setting or medium-size pot on the stove: Simmer **duck legs** in **1L of stock** and **Chinese 5 spice** for **3-4 hours** (make sure meat is submerged, when ready meat should fall off the bone). In the meantime prepare Hoisin sauce and salad.

**2.** Once cooked remove duck legs from the liquid and allow to cool-down for **20 minutes**. Next, pick the meat off the bone into a small container and cover with **cooking liquid** without spices (This will help to keep meat extra moist)

**3.** To serve, remove meat from the liquid and serve cold or warm with the salad, wraps and sauce.

**Instructions for the sauce:**

**1.** Blend **all the sauce ingredients** in the food processor. Once combined transfer to a small serving bowl and sprinkle with **sesame seeds**.

**2.** Homemade Hoisin can be stored in the fridge for up to **one month** and it works great for dipping, glaze for the meats or added to a stir-fry.

l630lj,Chicken Gyros Kebab with crunchy gherkin salad &amp; oregano garlic sauce,3099,75,"A long time ago in Krakow, there used to be that place where you could buy Gyros Kebab served in the puffed pitta bread. It is one of those that you start shovelling with your fork and halfway through you grab it with your hands.

Delicious grilled chicken in the very characteristic Greek spice blend, crunchy salad with gherkins, loads of garlic sauce. I tried to recreate that dish and without a shadow of a doubt, I succeeded.

The spice blend you can prepare in advance and store it in the jar. These ingredients should give you enough to make this recipe twice.

**Ingredients for Gyros spice blend:**

* 1tsp mild chilli powder
* 1tsp ground coriander
* 1/2tsp turmeric
* 3tsp oregano
* 1tsp marjoram
* 3tsp paprika
* 1tsp garlic powder
* 1tsp onion powder
* 0,5tsp ground fenugreek
* 1tsp ground mustard seeds
* 1tsp sugar
* 2tsp salt

This recipe makes 4 big portions

**Ingredients for the chicken:**

* 3 big chicken breasts sliced
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* half of the gyros spice blend
* 2 skewers

**Ingredients for the salad and sauce:**

* 1 medium onion sliced
* 2 medium tomatoes diced (sweeter than better)
* half of the small Chinese leaf thinly sliced
* 200g (7oz) of sweet gherkins diced
* 150g (5.3oz) sweetcorn
* 150g (5.3oz) thick yoghurt
* 2tsp mayo
* 1/2tsp oregano
* 1/2tsp black pepper
* 3 garlic cloves minced

**Ingredients for Pitta bread:**

* 350g (12.3oz) strong flour (contains more gluten, this helps to hold shape upon inflation)
* 1tsp baking powder
* 1tsp sugar
* 1tsp salt
* 100ml (0.1quart) milk (you can use water instead)
* 130g (4.6oz) yoghurt
* 50g (1.9oz) melted butter

**Instructions for chicken and salad:**

**1.** Mix the **chicken** with the **olive oil** and **spice blend**, skewer and leave it for minimum **30 minutes** or marinate **overnight**.

**2.** For the sauce mix **yoghurt** with minced **garlic**, **mayonnaise**, **oregano** and **black pepper**.

**3.** Grill the chicken skewers in the oven  250C (482F) for around **10 minutes** then turn upside down and grill for another **10 minutes** (place skewers in a baking dish). When ready take of the skewer and cover with tin foil to keep warm (thighs may need a little longer).

**4.** To serve **cut pitta in half** and stuff with **salad**, **chicken** and **sauce** (pour some of the chicken juice inside for extra flavour).

**Instructions for pitta:**

**1.** For the pitta bread mix all the **dry ingredients** together then **add all the wet**. Mix then knead for around **5 minutes**, until a smooth dough ball is formed. Rest for **30 minutes** covered with bowl or clingfilm.

**2.** Heat the oven to **250C (482F)** for at least **15 minutes** (for the pitta bread you will need to heat bakers stone, cast iron pan or a tray).

**3.** Divide the pitta dough into **four** and roll each one to a **20cm circle** about **2mm thick** (8-inch circle, about 0.08inch thick).

**4.** Place the dough on to the heated baking stone or cast iron pan. Applying heat from the bottom and the top will create puffed pitta, watch it closely not to burn it, this takes around **3,5 minutes**. (Do one at the time, and you may need to heat up your baking surface again before doing another one).

📷📷

**Insight:**

* I also like gyros chicken just with gherkin salad.
* If your pitta is not puffed, increase temperature or try to heat the oven for a longer time or roll pittas slightly thicker. You may also need to reheat the stone/cast iron between each pitta.

You also might be able to find a variation of jarred hot peppers and tomatoes at your grocery store that would be an okay substitute too!

There's really not much to this recipe, honestly, it's just one of my favorite quick weeknight meals that can be modified endlessly. Try it with pork chops or hot Italian sausage links. you can also do skinless chicken thighs or even chicken breasts, if you want to reduce calories.

Serve it over rice, buttered noodles or potatoes, mashed cauliflower, or with sautéed veggies.

**Crispy Chicken with Stewed Mushrooms**

Prep Time: 15 minutes | Cook Time: 20 minutes | Inactive time: 20 minutes | Total Time: 55 minutes | Servings: 4 | Calories: 528kcal

**Equipment**

* Wide pot

**Ingredients**

* 2 teaspoons oil
* 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 2 tablespoons butter optional
* 16 ounces cremini mushrooms sliced
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 2 cups chicken stock or water
* 16 ounce jar Oliverio peppers and tomatoes see note
* ½ cup fresh parsley minced
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Cooked white rice for serving, optional

**Instructions**

**Cook the Chicken:**

* Preheat oven to 425ºF. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Place in the pot, skin-side down, and cook for 5-6 minutes or until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Flip and cook 1-2 minutes more. Transfer to a plate.

**Cook the Onion:**

* Add the onion to the pot and cook for 4-5 minutes until softened.

**Cook the Mushrooms:**

* Melt the butter into the pot. Once melted and frothy, add the mushrooms and cook for 10-15 minutes until the mushrooms release their liquid and the liquid evaporates and the mushrooms turn deep golden brown. Season with salt, pepper, and dry thyme and toss to coat.

**Simmer the Stewed Mushrooms:**

* Pour in the chicken stock and peppers and tomatoes and bring to a boil. Cook for 4-5 minutes or until the liquid reduces slightly. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Bake the Chicken:**

* Arrange the chicken on top of the mushrooms and transfer to the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165ºF. If desired, turn on the broiler for the last two minutes to crisp up the skin again.

**Cook the Rice:**

* While the chicken bakes, cook the rice according to package instructions or prepare your favorite side dish, such as buttered noodles, boiled potatoes, or sautéed green beans.

**To Serve:**

* Remove the chicken from the oven and sprinkle with parsley. If serving with rice, spoon the mushrooms over the rice and place the chicken on top. Garnish with a touch more parsley. Enjoy!

**Notes**

If you don’t have Oliverio peppers and tomatoes, use a 14.5-ounce can crushed or diced tomatoes, 1 cup diced roasted red peppers, and crushed red pepper to taste.

k3lfzg,Seared Duck Breast with Lingonberry Sauce,65,8,"This perfectly seared duck breast with lingonberry sauce is a simple and beautiful meal.

### Equipment

* Skillet
* Sauce pan
* Large pot
* Colander
* Hand mixer

### Ingredients

#### Ricotta Mashed Potatoes:

* 1½ pounds Yukon gold potatoes peeled and quartered
* ½ cup ricotta cheese
* ½ cup whole milk plus more, as necessary
* 2 tablespoons butter
* ½ teaspoon nutmeg plus more as desired
* ½ teaspoon white pepper
* Salt to taste

#### Duck Breasts:

* 2 Moulard magret duck breasts skin scored and breasts seasoned all over with salt and pepper
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Lingonberry Sauce:

* 2 teaspoons reserved duck fat
* 3 tablespoons butter divided
* 1 shallot peeled and minced
* ½ cup lingonberry jam
* 1 lemon juiced
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* ¼ cup water

#### For Serving:

* 1 shallot peeled and thinly sliced into rounds
* 4 ounces arugula
* Salt and pepper

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Potatoes:

* Cover the diced Yukon gold potatoes with water and add salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 25 minutes until very soft. Drain into a colander and transfer to a large bowl.
* Add the ricotta, milk, butter, nutmeg, and white pepper to the bowl and use a hand mixer or potato masher to blend until smooth and creamy. If desired, add a few splashes more of milk until desired consistency is reached. Taste and season with salt. Add more nutmeg or white pepper to taste, as desired. Keep the potatoes warm as you prepare the rest of the meal.

#### Start the Duck:

* Place the duck breasts, skin-side down, in a skillet (ensuring that there is enough room for both of them without them touching each other). Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for 10-15 minutes until the skin is very deep, golden brown and the fat has rendered out. As you cook the duck skin, use a spoon to remove some of the duck fat and transfer to a heat-proof bowl.
* Flip the duck breasts and cook an additional 7-10 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 140ºF when inserted at the thickest part of the duck breast. Transfer to a wooden cutting board and cover with foil. Rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

#### Prepare the Lingonberry Sauce:

* While the duck is cooking, prepare the lingonberry sauce. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and two teaspoons of the reserved duck fat in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 2-3 minutes until softened.
* Add the lingonberry jam, lemon juice, ¼ water, and sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes until thickened. Once thickened and reduced, turn off the heat. Mount the butter into the sauce and stir until emulsified and glossy. Set aside.

#### Cook the Arugula:

* Immediately after the lingonberry sauce is cooked, prepare the arugula. Remove all but a tablespoon or two of duck fat from the skillet and transfer to the heatproof bowl.
* Turn the skillet to medium heat and add the sliced shallot. Cook for 2 minutes until softened.
* Add the arugula and cook for 3-4 minutes until mostly wilted. Turn off the heat and allow the residual heat to cook the arugula the rest of the way. Season with salt and pepper.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the mashed potatoes between shallow bowls. Pile the arugula on top and arrange the sliced duck breast on top. Spoon the lingonberry sauce on top. If you like, sprinkle a touch of nutmeg on top of the mashed potatoes and garnish with just a hint of flaky sea salt on top of the lingonberry sauce. Enjoy!

k3by3g,Simple Vietnamese Garlicky Roast Chicken,1929,67,"**VIETNAMESE GARLICKY ROAST CHICKEN!**  
Oftentimes when people think of Vietnamese food, they immediately think of pho or banh mi. Welp, Vietnamese people eat FAR more than just pho or banh mi, and at home, food is oftentimes far simpler and humbler, like this simple preparation of Vietnamese garlicky roast chicken. 

  
Roast chicken has thousands of iterations across cultures, but this is one of my absolute favorites, and it’s sooo simple: it’s got just six ingredients plus the chicken, and after 30 minutes roasting in the oven, you’ve got a lip-smackingly luscious bird that will beg to have its juices sopped up with some rice!

  
To watch my video on how to make this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90)  
**Viet Garlicky Roast Chicken Recipe (adapted from Andrea Nguyen)** 

  
1 whole 3.5-4 lb chicken, preferably organic and air-chilled, spatchcocked (back bone removed with bird splayed flat), OR 3.5-4 lb chicken parts (thighs, drumsticks, and wings) 

  
*Marinade ingredients:*

* 4 whole garlic cloves, minced finely 
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1.5 tsp sugar
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* 1.5 Tbsp neutral oil
* 3.5 Tbsp Maggi seasoning 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Combine all sauce ingredients into a bowl and mix well. 
2. Prepare the chicken: take the chicken (or chicken parts), and using a chopstick or skewer, carefully separate the skin from the meat all over. Then, add the marinade sauce all over the chicken with your hands, making sure to get the sauce between the meat and the skin. 
3. Refrigerate the chicken and allow to marinade for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor penetration. 
4. The next day, preheat oven to 500 F. Place spatchcocked chicken on a cast iron roasting pan or roasting tray. Place chicken in the oven and roast for about 30 minutes, checking about 5-10 min in to ensure the chicken isn’t browning too quickly. If it is, tent the darker parts with foil and lower heat to 450 F. If using parts, roast time may be closer to 40-45 min. 
5. After about 30 minutes, remove chicken from the oven. Check doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer - thighs should register about 165 F when done. 
6. Once the chicken is done, allow to rest for 15 min to ensure optimal juiciness level. Then, cut and serve with rice and enjoy. ",1606666379000,0.9902343750000001,Poultry,yvonnemeetsfood,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/k3by3g,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/k3by3g/simple_vietnamese_garlicky_roast_chicken/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/k3by3g/simple_vietnamese_garlicky_roast_chicken/,Thai green curry roast chicken,721.0,1.2,49.0,3.0,23.0,5.0,64.0,1.0,0.8400000000000001

* 1/3 cup coconut cream more or less if desired

## Herb Garnish:

* 2 limes juiced
* 1/3 cup fresh cilantro leaves
* 1 Serrano pepper thinly sliced, optional
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

## Cook the Chicken:

* Preheat oven to 425°F. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
* Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook without moving for 5-7 minutes until the skin is very crispy. Flip and cook 1-2 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a plate.

## Cook the Aromatics:

* Discard all but a teaspoon of fat in the skillet. Add the ginger and scallion whites and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the cherry tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 2-3 minutes until just barely beginning to soften.

## Bake the Chicken:

* Add 1/2 cup of the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and add the chicken to the skillet. Transfer to the oven for 25-30 minutes or until an instant read thermometer reaches 165ºF.

## Prepare the Coconut Curry Pumpkin:

* Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons oil in a saucepan. Add the shallots and cook for 3-4 minutes until softened.
* Add the sweet potato and a little butter, if desired, and cook for 4-5 minutes until just beginning to turn golden. Season with salt and pepper.
* Add the remaining chicken stock and bring to a boil.
* Reduce heat and add the pumpkin puree. Season with salt, pepper, cayenne powder, and curry powder. Simmer for 20 minutes or until the sweet potato is very tender.

## Prepare the Herb Garnish:

* In a food processor, combine the lime juice, cilantro, scallion greens, Serrano pepper, if using, and a sprinkle of salt. Pulse until finely chopped. Set aside.

## Finish the Coconut Curry Pumpkin:

* Once the sweet potato is very tender, use an immersion blender to puree the pumpkin. Continue blending until smooth. Stir in the coconut cream and season the puree to taste.

## To Serve:

* Divide the coconut curry pumpkin between shallow bowls. Pile the cooked tomatoes and ginger on top. Add a spoonful of the herb garnish on top of the tomatoes and place a chicken thigh on top. Enjoy!

Prep Time: 20 minutes

Cook Time: 30 minutes

Inactive time: 2 hours

Total Time: 2 hours 50 minutes *\*\* Note cook time will vary depending on how long you choose to cook the stock for.*

Servings: 4 

### Equipment

* Large pot
* Medium pot
* Fine mesh sieve

### Ingredients

#### Chicken Stock:

* 2½ pound whole chicken cut up
* 6 cups water
* 1 yellow onion peeled and quartered
* 1 head garlic halved cross-wise
* 1” piece of ginger cut into thirds
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* Salt and pepper to taste

#### Ramen:

* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil
* 1 shallot peeled and diced
* 8 ounces mushrooms trimmed and sliced
* 1 red chili pepper trimmed and sliced into rounds
* 2 teaspoons mirin
* 1 head bok choy washed and chopped into 2” pieces
* 1 tablespoon white miso paste
* 16 ounces fresh ramen
* 2 radishes thinly sliced, optional, for garnish
* Chili oil optional, for garnish
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Cook the Chicken Stock:

* Cover the chicken with 6 cups water (more, if needed to fully cover the chicken) in a large pot. Add the onion, garlic, ginger, sesame oil, and soy sauce. Season liberally with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for at least 1 hour or until the chicken is falling off the bone and the broth has deepened in color and has reduced to no more than 3 cups.

#### Strain the Stock:

* Transfer the chicken and garlic to a bowl. Strain the stock into a large bowl through a fine mesh sieve and discard the remaining solids. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.

#### Finish the Stock:

* Pick the chicken from the bone and discard the bones. Pop the garlic from the cloves and gently mash into the chicken. Discard the paper skin from the garlic. Transfer the plate of chicken and garlic to the bowl of stock to keep it moist.

#### Finish the Ramen:

* In the same large pot used to cook the stock, heat the neutral oil over medium-high heat. Add the shallot and mushrooms and cook for 6-8 minutes until the mushrooms begin to turn golden brown. Add the chili pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
* Pour in the chicken and chicken stock and add 3 cups of water. Bring to a boil and then add the mirin. Taste and add more sesame oil or soy sauce, if desired. Be careful not to over-salt the broth. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Taste and season again to your preference.
* Add the chopped bok choy to the broth and cook for 5-7 minutes until bright green. Turn off the heat and whisk in the miso paste until completely incorporated.

#### Cook the Ramen:

* While the broth finishes cooking, boil the ramen according to package instructions. Drain and divide the ramen between 4 bowls.

#### To Serve:

* Ladle the ramen broth over each bowl and garnish with chili oil and sliced radishes.

Stuffed squash is a great healthy and simple way to kick off the fall cooking season! It's also a great way to use up leftovers. I happened to use some leftover chicken for the filling, but if you don’t have that, any ground or shredded turkey or chicken can work as a substitute. The quinoa &amp; garlic was also leftover from the prior day, but that can be cooked as needed as well.

**Ingredients:**

* 2 acorn squash
* 1 cup of shredded chicken (or cooked ground chicken)
* ½ cup cooked quinoa
* 2 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro
* ⅓ squeezed lemon juice
* ½ cup chopped walnuts
* 2 cloves of roasted garlic
* ½ cup blueberries
* 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* ⅓ cup chopped feta cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
2. Cut the squash in half, lengthwise, and oil both sides. Remove seeds from squash. Place it face down on a lined baking sheet and bake at 450 for 30 minutes.
3. In a bowl, mix all ingredients together except the feta cheese. Save a small amount of the cilantro for topping.
4. When squash is finished, scoop out a small cavity to make the hole larger, and combine scooped squash with the other ingredients.
5. Fill the squash halves and top with feta cheese.
6. Bake for 10 minutes at 450.
7. When you remove them from the oven, top with the remaining cilantro.",1601606089000,0.9301757812,Poultry,ForkAndPepper,https://i.redd.it/3h8lirtx4lq51.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/j3lnpp/stuffed_acorn_squash/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/j3lnpp/stuffed_acorn_squash/,Stuffed butternut squash,430.0,1.3,22.0,15.0,6.0,42.0,13.0,6.0,0.9

6. Let it cool down while you are preparing the sauce.
7. If you can/want, char the skin of the bell pepper and tomatoes. I generally remove the charred skin of the bell pepper but keep on the tomatoes.
8. Put in a blender half an onion, the garlic cloves, tomatoes, bell pepper, the rehydrated chipotle with their water and a teaspoon of salt, and blend until smooth.  
9. Preheat some oil in a pan on medium-high heat and pour the sauce in it. Cook it for 5-10 minutes or until the consistency you like.
10. Shred the chicken and grate the cheeses.
11. Preheat your oven at 200°C (or 390°F).
12. Pour a little of your sauce in a baking dish.
13. Fill up the tortillas with the shredded chicken and half of the cheese, and put them in the baking dish.

1. Season the tenderloin with salt and pepper and sear over high heat, on all sides.  Remove from heat, and slather with Dijon mustard. Place in fridge.
2. Finely chop 1 1/2 cups mushrooms, a shallot and thyme. Combine in food processor until it resembles a thick paste.

17ho1lc,Steak and Ale Pie (Guinness),296,46,"Hello, food lovers! The colder months are upon us, and in England, there’s no heartier dish for the evening than Steak and Ale Pie with Guinness. This versatile recipe is expertly balanced to mitigate the bitterness of the stout, earning it the title of Best Ale Beef Pie. Additionally, I’ve included methods for preparing it solely as a stew or using a slow cooker for added convenience. Lets get cooking!

**Ingredients:**

\* 1.1 lbs Beef stewing steak - (500g) diced

\* 3 Onions, medium size - peeled and diced

\* 2 Carrots, medium size - peeled and diced

\* 1 Celery stalk - fine dice

\* 6 Garlic cloves - sliced

\* 1.1 lbs Potatoes - (500g) large dice

\* 1 can Guinness - (440ml) or other ale or stout

\* 1.7 cups Beef stock - (400ml)

\* 2 tbsp Tomato paste

\* 1 tbsp Fresh thyme

\* 1 tsp Black pepper

\* 2 tbsp Vegetable oil

\* 2 tbsp All-purpose flour

\* 1 sheet Ready-rolled puff pastry

\* 1 Egg - beaten (for glazing)

**Instructions:**

**1.** In a large pot or deep skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Toss the beef cubes in flour, shaking off the excess, and brown them in the hot oil. Remove and set aside.

**2.** In the same pot, add a bit more oil if needed and sauté the onions, carrots, and celery until softened. Add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes.

**3.** Pour in the Guinness and beef stock, then add the tomato paste. Stir well, ensuring all the brown bits from the bottom of the pot are incorporated.

**4.** Add the browned beef back into the pot, season with salt and pepper, and stir. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 1 hour.

**5.** After 1 hour of simmering, add the diced potatoes into the pot and continue simmering for another 30 minutes to 1 hour, or until the beef is tender and the sauce has thickened.

**6.** Preheat your oven to 356℉ (180°C) in preparation for baking the pie.

**7.** Once the filling is ready, if you prefer a thicker sauce, you can thicken it further using a gravy mix or a slurry of flour and water. Stir until the desired consistency is achieved. Transfer the thickened filling to a pie dish. Roll out the puff pastry and place it over the top of the filling, crimping the edges. Make a small slit in the centre for steam to escape. Brush the top with the beaten egg for a golden finish.

**8.** Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.

**9.** Allow the pie to rest for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy with a side salad or additional vegetables if desired :)

* 1 pound ground beef, 90/10
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed, wiped clean, and sliced
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* ¼ cup water, plus more if needed
* 2 14.5-ounce cans crushed tomatoes
* Pinch of sugar
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* 4 ounces baby spinach, finely chopped
* 2 cups dry orzo
* 10-12 basil leaves, for garnish
* Salt and pepper

**Brown the beef:**

1. Place a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the beef and cook, breaking it up as it cooks, for 15 minutes. Add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil if the beef is very lean. Season well with salt, pepper, and a big pinch of crushed red pepper. Once the beef is cooked through, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

**Cook the mushrooms:**

1. Add the mushrooms to the skillet and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes until they release their liquid and the liquid evaporates.
2. Once the mushrooms are dry and turn light golden brown, add a pinch of salt and 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil. Fry the mushrooms in the oil for 1–2 minutes until deep golden brown. Transfer the mushrooms to the plate with the ground beef.

**Cook the aromatics:**

1. Add the diced onion to the pot and cook, turning regularly, for 5–7 minutes until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Brown the tomato paste:**

1. Add the tomato paste to the skillet and use your spoon to mash it into the vegetables. Cook for 2–3 minutes until the paste deepens in color and begins to stick to the bottom of the pot.
2. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Stir to form a thick tomatoey slurry and lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot.

**Simmer the sauce:**

1. Add the canned tomatoes, a pinch of sugar, and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and add the ground beef and mushrooms. Taste and add salt and pepper. Simmer uncovered for 30 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Add water if the sauce evaporates too quickly. Taste and adjust seasonings.

**Cook the orzo:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a big pinch of salt and the orzo. Stir as you add the orzo to the water to prevent it from clumping. Cook according to package instructions, about 7–8 minutes for al dente. Scoop out ½ cup of the water and then drain the orzo.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings. Add the chopped spinach and simmer for 3–4 minutes until wilted.

**Sauce the orzo:**

1. Add the cooked orzo to the pot and half the reserved pasta water. Stir to coat the orzo, adding the remaining pasta water if needed. Cook for 1–2 minutes or until the orzo is nicely coated. Taste and season one final time. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the orzo into a large serving platter. Scatter fresh basil leaves on top. Finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

Simmer over low heat for 15–20 minutes. Add more water as needed if it evaporates too quickly. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.

**Make the rice:**

1. Combine the rice, 2 cups of water, and 1 tablespoon of butter in a small pot. Add a sprinkle of salt. Bring to a boil, stir once, then reduce heat and cover. Simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let stand for 10 minutes.

**Make the broccoli:**

1. Arrange the broccoli on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of neutral oil. Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon of gochugaru on top (or use a pinch of crushed red pepper). Season with salt. Transfer to the oven and roast for 15–20 minutes until browned on the edges. Remove from the oven and set aside.

**Prepare the toppings:**

1. As the broccoli roasts, prepare any toppings you like and arrange them on a serving platter.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the rice into bowls and pile the beef and broccoli on top. Arrange garnishes on top and drizzle with sesame oil. Finish each bowl with a sprinkle of sesame seeds and gochugaru. Enjoy!

**Notes**

*\*Note: Gochugaru may be less spicy than crushed red pepper flakes depending on the brand. Do not substitute at a 1:1 ratio.

13hgyi9,Beef Stew with Brown Butter Noodles,1344,30,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Beef Stew with Brown Butter Noodles**](https://newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com/p/recipe-for-the-week-bb1)

**Beef:**

* ¼ cup flour
* 2 pounds beef stew cubes
* 2 teaspoons black pepper (freshly cracked, preferably)
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 1–2 tablespoons neutral oil, for frying

**Beef stew:**

* 8 ounces mushrooms, trimmed and sliced
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil, if needed
* 1 large yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 3 ribs celery, trimmed and sliced on a bias
* 4 carrots, peeled and sliced into rounds on a bias
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 heaping teaspoon dry thyme
* ¼ cup flour
* 4 cups of water or beef stock plus 1–2 cups more
* 1 cup frozen peas
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Brown butter noodles:**

* 16 ounces wide egg noodles
* 5 tablespoons butter, cut into evenly-sized pieces
* ⅓ cup loosely packed fresh parsley, minced
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prepare the beef:**

1. Add the flour, black pepper, salt, and paprika to a large bowl and stir to combine.
2. Blot off any excess liquid from the beef. Add it to the bowl with the flour and toss to coat.

**Brown the beef:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the beef in an even layer. Do not overcrowd the pot; you will likely need to brown the beef in batches. Cook for 3–5 minutes on each side until browned all over. Transfer to a large bowl and keep the pot on medium-high heat. Add more oil, as needed, while browning the beef.

**Cook the mushrooms:**

1. Add the sliced mushrooms to the pot. Cook, turning occasionally, for 7–8 minutes until lightly browned. Continue cooking for an additional 2–3 minutes until deep golden brown. Season lightly with salt and transfer to the bowl with the beef.

**Sauté the mirepoix:**

1. If the pot is dry, add another drizzle of neutral oil. Turn the heat to medium and add the onion, celery, and carrots. Season all over with salt and pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, for 7–8 minutes until the onions are translucent and the carrots begin to brown around the edges.
2. Melt the butter in the pot and add the garlic and thyme. Toss to coat and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the stew:**

1. Sprinkle the flour over the aromatics and toss to coat. Cook for 1–2 minutes until nutty and aromatic. Add ½ cup of the water or beef stock and whisk to form a slurry. Continue adding the liquid, in ½-cup increments until all 4 cups of liquid have been incorporated. 
2. Return the beef and mushrooms to the pot. Add the remaining 1–2 cups liquid if needed to ensure the beef is completely submerged with liquid. Taste and season the broth with more salt and pepper, if needed. *Note: You may need to add more liquid as the beef cooks. You can use additional beef stock or continue adding water if the broth of the stew evaporates too quickly.*
3. Reduce the heat on the beef stew to low. Cover and simmer and 1½ hours. Check the stew occasionally and add more liquid as needed.

**Finish the stew:**

1. Uncover the stew and simmer for an additional 15–20 minutes, uncovered. Taste and season once more to your preferences.
2. Add the frozen peas and cook for 5 minutes until warmed through and bright green. Turn off the heat.

**Prepare the noodles:**

1. As the stew finishes simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse and set aside. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.
2. Turn the heat to medium and add the butter. Whisk often for 5–7 minutes until it turns golden brown and takes on a nutty aroma. As soon as the butter browns, add the garlic and parsley and turn off the heat. Stir constantly off the heat for at least 30 seconds to cook the garlic and prevent the butter from burning.
3. Once the butter is nice and fragrant and garlicky, add the cooked noodles and toss to coat. Add salt and pepper to taste. If your noodles are cold, you can return the pot to the stovetop and warm them up over gentle heat right before serving.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the cooked noodles between bowls and pile the stew on top.

* 1 lime, juiced
* 1 serrano or jalapeño pepper, trimmed and minced
* ½ small red onion, peeled and minced (about 1–2 tablespoons total)

* 1 teaspoon ancho chili powder
* ½ teaspoon paprika
* ¼ teaspoon cayenne powder
* 1 lime, juiced

* ½ small red onion, peeled and sliced
* Neutral oil, for frying
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Small flour tortillas, warmed according to package instructions
* Shredded lettuce
* Lime wedges

**Make the salsa:**

1. Combine the avocado, mango, lime juice, minced serrano, and minced red onion in a bowl. Season with a generous pinch of salt and stir to combine. Taste and add more salt if needed. Transfer to the refrigerator.

**Parboil the potatoes:**

1. Preheat oven to 425ºF.
2. Place the diced potatoes, baking soda, and salt in a large pot. Cover with water by 1 inch and bring to a boil. Cook for 10 minutes until just slightly under fork-tender. Drain into a large bowl.
3. Using tongs, transfer the potatoes to a baking sheet in an even layer. Let stand for 5–10 minutes.

**Roast the potatoes:**

1. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl with the extra virgin olive oil, ancho chili powder, paprika, and cayenne powder. Taste and add more salt, if needed. Toss to coat. Return to the baking sheet in an even layer and roast for 20–30 minutes until golden brown.

**Dress the potatoes:**

1. Wipe out the bowl you used to season the potatoes and add lime juice, minced cilantro, and minced serrano pepper.
2. Carefully add the roasted potatoes to the bowl and toss to coat. Taste and season once more with salt and pepper if needed. Transfer to a serving bowl.

**Cook the steak:**

1. Place a skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Add a scant amount of neutral oil and use a paper towel to brush it into an even layer. The skillet should be slick but not pooling oil anywhere.
2. Pat the steak dry and season with salt, pepper, and chili powder.
3. Turn the heat on the skillet to high. Let it continue to heat for 1–2 minutes. Add the steak and cook without moving for 3–4 minutes. Flip and continue cooking, adjusting the heat if needed until it reaches your desired internal temperature. Skirt steak only needs to cook for 3–4 minutes per side, depending on how thick it is. Transfer it to a plate and cover with foil to rest for 5–10 minutes.

**Fry the vegetables:**

1. Return the heat on the skillet to medium-high. Add another drizzle of neutral oil and let it heat for 1 minute. Once hot and shimmering, add the sliced peppers and onion. Cook, turning occasionally, for 5 minutes until tender-crisp and charred in spots. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to one side of a serving platter.

**Slice the steak:**

1. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and slice thinly against the grain. Transfer to the other side of the serving platter with the cooked peppers.

**To serve:**

1. Pile the steak and peppers into warm tortillas with shredded lettuce. Spoon the mango-avocado salsa on top. Serve the warm roasted potatoes on the side.

**Ingredients for Beef Quesadilla:**

\* 400g (14.1oz) of the diced beef shin (or other cuts high in connective tissue)

\* 150g (5.3oz) Oaxaca cheese or substitute with mozzarella

\* 200g (7oz) sweet bell peppers, seeds removed and sliced

\* 1 medium onion roughly chopped

\* 2 garlic cloves minced

\* 1tsp mild chilli powder

\* 1tsp ground cumin

\* 1tsp cumin seeds

\* 1tsp dried or fresh oregano

\* 2tsp paprika

\* 1tbsp of chipotle paste

\* 500ml (0.52quarts) of beef or vegetable stock

\* 5g (0.17oz) chopped parsley

\* 1tsp of salt

\* 4 medium-size wraps (20cm (8inch) diameter)

\* vegetable oil

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Beef Quesadilla:**

**1.** Marinate the beef in cumin, paprika, chili powder, marjoram, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of oil. You can marinate the beef the day before or at least 30 minutes before cooking.

**2.** Fry the meat with onions on high heat to colour and transfer to the slow cooker (you can use a pot or leave it in the same pan as well) add stock to cover the meat and add one tsp of salt. Set the slow cooker on high setting for 3-4 hours (for overnight cooking, keep the beef in larger pieces and set on low setting)

**3.** While the beef is cooking, fry the sweet peppers on medium heat for about 10 minutes, and set them aside for later.

**4.** When the beef is tender, remove it from the slow cooker, and let it cool for a few minutes in the cooking juices. Then, remove it from the liquid, and shred it with your fingers. Mix the shredded beef with the fried sweet peppers, chopped parsley, tomato paste, chipotle paste and some of the meat cooking juices.

**5.** Brush one side of the tortilla with olive oil and place it on a heated frying pan. Add cheese to one side and top with the shredded beef mixture. Once the tortilla is golden-brown, fold it over and flatten slightly.

**6.** Remove the quesadilla from the pan and cut it in half before serving. Enjoy with your favourite Mexican toppings! Enjoy!

**Beef:**

* 1 tablespoon lemongrass paste
* 2 teaspoons minced ginger
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 4 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper, trimmed and minced, or use a serrano pepper
* 1 teaspoon chili oil
* 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch or sweet potato starch
* 16 ounces skirt steak or flank steak

**Stir-fry:**

* 3 tablespoons neutral oil, divided
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and halved lengthwise and thinly sliced into wedges
* 8 ounces snow peas, tough string removed from both sides of the snow peas
* 1 red bell pepper, trimmed, seeded, and sliced into strips
* 1 teaspoon minced ginger
* ¼ cup water
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Cooked white rice
* Fresh cilantro or minced scallions
* Lime wedges
* Crispy shallots

**Make the rice:**

* Before beginning, I recommend making a pot of rice first. Then, keep it warm as you prepare the stir-fry.

**Prepare the marinade:**

* Gather all of the ingredients for the marinade except the cornstarch and beef in a large bowl. Stir until completely combined. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add the cornstarch and stir until smooth. Set aside.
* Pat the beef dry and cut (with the grain) into 4-inch long pieces to make it easier to slice into strips. Next, cut the resulting beef pieces against the grain into ½-inch wide strips. Cutting against the grain will yield the most tender beef, so be mindful of how you slice!
* Add the beef to the bowl of marinade and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator for 15–30 minutes.

**Cook the vegetables:**

* Heat half the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the onion, snow peas, and red bell pepper. Cook in batches if needed. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the pepper begins to char and the snow peas are bright green and tender, about 5–7 minutes. Stir in the ginger and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.
* Remove the vegetables from the skillet and transfer to a bowl.

**Cook the beef:** 

* Add the remaining oil to the skillet over medium-high heat.  Once hot, pour in the beef with all of the marinade. A splatter screen will help with the sputtering! Spread the beef into an even layer. Cook for 3–4 minutes until the beef begins to brown and the marinade is bubbling.
* Crank the heat during the first 3 minutes and watch it closely to develop a sear on the beef without burning the marinade. Then, adjust the heat back to medium-high. It will look like the sauce separates as it cooks, but don’t worry!
* After 3–4 minutes, flip the beef and continue cooking, often turning, for 2–4 minutes or until the beef is mostly cooked through.
* Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and stir to develop a thick sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings. Turn off the heat and stir in the vegetables. Toss to coat.

**To serve:**

* Arrange the cooked white rice on a serving platter and pile the stir-fried beef and vegetables on top. Garnish with cilantro, scallions, lime wedges, and crispy shallots.

**Make the potatoes:**

1. Add the potatoes to a large pot of salted water and bring them to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes until fork-tender. Drain the potatoes into a fine-mesh sieve.

**Rice the potatoes, optional:**

1. If you have a ricer, rice the potatoes. Alternatively, place the sieve over a large bowl, use a spatula or a large measuring cup, and press the potatoes through the sieve.

**Prepare the mashed potatoes:**

1. Add the melted butter, milk, and white pepper to the potatoes and mash until smooth and creamy. Taste and season with salt.
2. Prepare the cottage pie: Grease a baking dish with butter, if needed. Pour the gravy into the baking dish and spoon or pipe the mashed potatoes on top. Smooth it out with the back of your spoon.
3. Transfer to the oven for 30 minutes.

**Broil the cottage pie, optional:**

1. Pour 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the mashed potatoes. Turn on the broiler and broil the dish until the potatoes turn golden brown on top, 2–3 minutes. Remove from the broiler and let stand for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with freshly minced parsley.

* 2 eggs
* 8 ounces ricotta cheese
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 1 cup Italian-seasoned panko, more if needed
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder or a roasted garlic spice blend
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper, more to taste
* 2 shallots, finely minced
* 2 pounds ground beef, 90/10
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1 tablespoon olive oil, for frying

**Sauce:**

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1/2 cup red wine or use beef stock
* 32 oz crushed tomatoes
* 2 sprigs fresh basil
* Salt, pepper, and sugar if needed.

**Prepare the meatballs:**

* Whisk the eggs, ricotta cheese, and heavy cream in a large bowl until smooth. Add the panko and mix until smooth. Let stand for 10 minutes.
* Add the garlic powder, crushed red pepper, shallots, and beef. Season all over with salt and pepper. Mix with your hands until well-combined. Fry or microwave a small pinch of the mixture so you can taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.

xrkixt,Beef Wellington - Gordon Ramsay style,3120,64,"Ingredients:

•	2 x 400g beef fillets  
•	Olive oil, for frying  
•	500g mixture of wild mushrooms, cleaned  
•	1 thyme sprig, leaves only  
•	500g puff pastry  
•	8 slices of Parma ham  
•	2 egg yolks, beaten with 1 tbsp water and a pinch of salt  
•	Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper  


Ingredients for the red wine sauce:

•	2 tbsp olive oil  
•	200g beef trimmings (ask the butcher to reserve these when trimming the fillet)  
•	4 large shallots, peeled and sliced  
•	12 black peppercorns  
•	1 bay leaf  
•	1 thyme sprig  
•	Splash of red wine vinegar  
•	1 x 750ml bottle red wine  
•	750ml beef stock  


&amp;#x200B;

Directions: (comment if you need any help)

1.	Wrap each piece of beef tightly in a triple layer of cling film to set its shape, then chill overnight.  
  
2.	Remove the cling film, then quickly sear the beef fillets in a hot pan with a little olive oil for 30-60 seconds until browned all over and rare in the middle. Remove from the pan and leave to cool.  
  
3.	Finely chop the mushrooms and fry in a hot pan with a little olive oil, the thyme leaves and some seasoning. When the mushrooms begin to release their juices, continue to cook over a high heat for about 10 minutes until all the excess moisture has evaporated and you are left with a mushroom paste (known as a duxelle). Remove the duxelle from the pan and leave to cool.  
  
4.	Cut the pastry in half, place on a lightly floured surface and roll each piece into a rectangle large enough to envelop one of the beef fillets. Chill in the refrigerator.  
  
5.	Lay a large sheet of cling film on a work surface and place 4 slices of Parma ham in the middle, overlapping them slightly, to create a square. Spread half the duxelle evenly over the ham.  
  
6.	Season the beef fillets, then place them on top of the mushroom-covered ham. Using the cling film, roll the Parma ham over the beef, then roll and tie the cling film to get a nice, evenly thick log. Repeat this step with the other beef fillet, then chill for at least 30 minutes.  
  
7.	Brush the pastry with the egg wash. Remove the cling film from the beef, then wrap the pastry around each ham-wrapped fillet. Trim the pastry and brush all over with the egg wash. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes.  
  
8.	Meanwhile, make the red wine sauce. Heat the oil in a large pan, then fry the beef trimmings for a few minutes until browned on all sides. Stir in the shallots with the peppercorns, bay and thyme and continue to cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the shallots turn golden brown.  
  
9.	Pour in the vinegar and let it bubble for a few minutes until almost dry. Now add the wine and boil until almost completely reduced. Add the stock and bring to the boil again. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 1 hour, removing any scum from the surface of the sauce, until you have the desired consistency. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve lined with muslin. Check for seasoning and set aside.  
  
10.	When you are ready to cook the beef wellingtons, score the pastry lightly and brush with the egg wash again, then bake at 200°C/Gas 6 for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and cooked. Rest for 10 minutes before carving.  
  
11.	Meanwhile, reheat the sauce. Serve the beef wellingtons sliced, with the sauce as an accompaniment.

vqedgc,Beef Madras Curry,124,5,"Who doesn't like super tender beef in rich tomato-based curry sauce? It melts in the mouth and is super easy to prepare! I have separated the process of cooking as most online recipes call for, this gives more control over meat tenderness and the right consistency of the sauce, just like in the restaurant setting, bringing the best quality to your home cooking :)

**Ingredients for Marinade:**

\* 500g (1.1Pound) Beef chuck steak diced to 2,5cm cubes (you can use any braising cut if chuck is not available)

\* 1tbsp of ginger &amp; garlic paste

\* 1tbsp vegetable oil

\* 1tsp of salt

\* 1 lemon juice

\* 3tbsp of Madras spice blend

**Ingredients for Madras Spice Blend:**

\* 3tbsp ground coriander

\* 3tbsp ground cumin

\* 2tbsp ground turmeric

\* 2tbsp chilli powder (adjust to your preference)

\* 2tbsp garam masala

\* 1tsp black pepper

**Ingredients for the Curry:**

\* 500g of marinated Beef

\* enough water to cover the meat during slow-cooking

\* 2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil

\* 1 large onion, small dice

\* 1tbsp of garlic &amp; ginger paste

\* 3tbsp of Madras spice blend

\* 400ml of vegetable stock

\* 4tbsp of tomato puree

\* juice of a half lemon

\* 1tsp of sugar

\* 1 beef stock cube

\* a handful of fresh coriander leaves and seeds

\* papadam to serve

**Instructions:**

1. Prepare the Madras spice blend by mixing the ingredients. It will make more than you need for the recipe (you can always add more at the end of cooking to boost the flavour)
2. Place the beef in the bowl and marinate by mixing all the ingredients from the list with the meat. Place in the fridge overnight.
3. On the following day, sear the beef in a frying pan over high heat and transfer it to a slow-cooker or a pot (do not over-fry it as it will make your meat dry, you want a nice caramelization on one side of each piece) Add enough hot water to cover the meat and cook covered on low until tender. This can take 2-3 hours depending on the cut used (a slow-cooker can take longer).
4. In the meantime prepare the sauce. In a medium-sized pan heat 2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil, add diced onion and fry over medium heat until soft and browned.
5. Add 1tbsp of garlic ginger paste, 3tbsp of Madras spice blend and cook until fragrant.
6. Add vegetable stock, tomato puree, beef stock cube, 1tsp of sugar and lemon juice. Mix together and bring to a boil. Blend sauce and adjust seasoning to your preference, remove from the heat until needed.
7. Once the beef is tender and connective tissue has turned into jelly, separate it from the liquid. Add beef to the sauce plus a little bit of the cooking stock.
8. Continue cooking on low heat until the thick consistency of the sauce is reached.
9. Serve Beef Madras with fresh coriander seeds and leaves. Crunch with papadam, cucumber raita and onion salad. Enjoy!

**Insight:**

\- The slow cooker's low setting is approximately 90C (194F). A high setting brings the cooking temperature to around 100C (212F).

\- Collagen - connective tissue in the meat begins to dissolve into gelatin at a temperature of 70C (160F). Lower cooking temperatures and longer time result in a juicer and tenderer meat.

s8ro6h,Beef teriyaki noodles with bok choy and shiitake mushrooms,2576,28,"**Ingredients⁠**

* 1 Bok choy
* 200gr shitake mushrooms
* 200gr bean sprouts (tauge)
* 2 red onions
* ⁠5 spring onions
* ⁠3 garlic cloves
* A few thyme twigs
* Teriyaki sauce
* Noodles
* Fried onions
* Sirloin steak
* Butter
* ⁠Salt
* Pepper
* Chili flakes

\`This was for 2 people.

**Instructions**

1. Cut the red onions and add it to a wok. Fry it in some oil. Then add the shitake mushrooms and add some seasoning (pepper, salt, chili flakes) and fry these together on medium heat until they have a nice color. Put heat on lowest.
2. Cut the garlic cloves. Not too small or they will burn. Season the steak with pepper and salt. Put some oil in a different pan on high heat. Add the steak and sear both sides on high heat for a minute.
3. Then add a generous lump of butter, the garlic and some thyme twigs. Turn down the heat to medium and let the steak fry in the butter/garlic/thyme mixture for another minute or 2. Spoon some butter mixture on top of the steak regularly. You can also tilt your pan forwards so the butter and the steak slide to the far end to infuse the steak with the mixture.
4. Brush some teriyaki sauce on the top and turn the steak to caramelise the brushed-on sauce. Do the same for the other side. Your steak should now be crispy on both sides. Take the steak out of the pan and let rest in aluminium foil. Remove the thyme twigs from the pan.

SAUCE:

* 1 tbsp light soy sauce (low sodium)

pjlsnt,Russian Steak Gravy AKA Beef Stroganoff,64,3,"Beef Stroganoff: tasty, creamy and very comforting! Also rather easy-to-make and takes less than 20 minutes to prep.

You can have it with pasta, mashed potatoes, polenta or even fries. No matter what you serve your Beef Stroganoff with, enjoy!

INGREDIENTS:

\- good quality, not too tough cut of beef, such as sirloin or rib-eye \[10 oz / 300 g\]

\- vegetable oil \[1 tbsp / 15 ml\]

\- butter \[1 tbsp / 15 g\]

\- half an onion

\- button or cremini mushrooms \[4 oz / 120 g\]

\- 1 big garlic clove

\- all purpose flour \[1 tbsp\]

\- beef broth \[1 cup / 250 ml\]

\- crème fraîche \[1/3 cup / 80 g\]

\- Dijon mustard \[2 tsp / 10 g\]

\- a handful of chopped chives

Servings: 2

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Cut the beef into small stripes of approximately 8mm or 1/3inch in thickness and 3-4 cm, or 1-1.5inch in lenth. Maybe a bit shorter, if you re cooking for children. Slice the mushrooms and roughly chop the onion, too
2. Over high heat, sprinkle half a tablespoon of vegetable oil into your pan, which should preferably be NOT non-stick, to better sear the meat. Once the pan is really hot, season your meat with salt and pepper and immediately transfer into the pan. DON'T overcrowd the pan and fry stripes for 30-45 seconds. Quickly turn once browned and sear from other side for another 30-45 seconds and set aside on a plate
3. Once you seared your meat, reduce the heat to medium, and, into the same pan, add a tablespoon of butter and sauté the mushrooms and onion in it for approximately 5 minutes
4. When the mushrooms start to nicely brown, crush in a big garlic clove into the mix and fry together for one minute, or till fragrant
5. Sprinkle a tablespoon of all purpose flour on top, stir constantly and toast the flour for a minute, before deglazing everything with a cup of beef broth
6. Add the crème fraîche, as well as mustard and mix well. Bring to a slight boil, reduce the heat of the pan to low and let simmer for 5-10 minutes, till the sauce reduces to the consistency of your choice
7. When your gravy's texture is almost right, season it with salt and pepper to taste and bring back the meat and mix it into the gravy. Turn off the heat after a minute, sprinkle a tablespoon of finely chopped chives on your beef Stroganoff and that's it! NOTE: If you got a good, rather tender cut, you don't need to and shouldn't cook the meat in the gravy anymore, for it will overcook and get tough. Whereas, when you get a rather tough cut such as Chuck, you will need to cook it in the gravy for 1-1.5hours

n0iygg,Mongolian Beef with Rice,110,16,"Ingredients:

For the beef:

500g / ~1lb of beef (flank)

A bowl full of cornstarch

Salt / pepper


The sauce:

3 Tbsp Soy Sauce (any kind)

3 tbsp of broth (any kind)

2 tbsp of hoisin sauce or any other asian sticky sauce you have at hand

1 tbsp of brown sugar or sugar

A spoonful of grated ginger

4 minced cloves of garlic

1 spring onion

1 red bell pepper

_____________

Instructions:

1. marinate the sliced flank for 24h in an acidic marinade (I just used soy sauce)

2. Coat the beef slices in the seasoned (just a little salt and pepper added) cornstarch and shallow fry them in a pan.

3. When they're deep brown and crispy, take them out to dry on a rack. Then prepare the sauce.

4. Add all liquid ingredients to the sugar and thoroughly mix, then set aside. 

5. Cut the vegetables (bell pepper and spring onion) preferably thinly julienned. 

6. To a hot pan, add some sesame oil or normal vegetable oil (I used vegetable oil but that's just because I'm a broke student heh), add the minced garlic and the ginger, shortly followed by the pepper and spring onion.

7. After a few minutes it should smell really aromatic, that's when you add in your fried beef slices. Let them soak in the garlicy-gingery flavor for a minute or two and dump in your liquid mix. 

8. After stirring a bit the sauce should thicken slightly, that's when you can pour your beef over a prepared bowl of rice and enjoy.

Calories: 667kcal

Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large pot

Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 2½ pounds mushrooms, sliced I used a blend of baby bella and white mushrooms
* 2 yellow onions peeled and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 5 tablespoons butter divided
* 1½ pounds skirt steak sliced against the grain into thin strips; or use ribeye, filet mignon tips, or top sirloin
* ½ teaspoon nutmeg
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper
* ½ teaspoon dry thyme
* 3 cups beef stock divided
* ¼ cup flour
* 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
* ½ cup fresh parsley minced; divided
* ¼ cup sour cream
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 16 ounces egg noodles

InstructionsCook the Mushrooms:

* Heat the oil in a wide, deep pot over medium-high. Once hot, add half the mushrooms and cook for 8-10 minutes until well-browned. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a bowl. Cook the remaining mushrooms until well-browned and transfer to the same bowl.

Cook the Mushrooms:

* If the pot is too dry, add another teaspoon or two of oil and add the onions. Cook for 10-15 minutes until they begin to soften significantly and turn golden brown. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent them from burning. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the bowl of mushrooms.

Cook the Beef:

* Season the sliced beef with salt and pepper and pat dry. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter into the pot and add the beef in batches. Cook without moving until well-browned and no longer pink.
* Add the nutmeg, crushed red pepper, and thyme to the pot and cook for 30-45 seconds until fragrant.
* Add the mushrooms and onions and toss to combine everything. Turn the heat to high. Once the pot is sizzling, add ½ cup beef stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Prepare the Gravy:

* Warm the remaining beef stock in the microwave. Whisk the flour into the warm stock and add the Worcestershire sauce.
* Pour the mixture into the pot and bring to a low boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes. Season again with salt and pepper.

Cook the Noodles:

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the egg noodles according to package instructions. Drain and return the pot to the stove.
* Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the pot. Add the egg noodles and half the minced parsley and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.

Finish the Beef Stroganoff:

* Scoop out ½ cup of the gravy from the beef stroganoff. Stir in the sour cream and whisk until smooth. The sour cream should be warmed through. Pour the mixture into the pot of beef and stir to combine.
* Add the remaining minced parsley to the beef stroganoff and turn off the heat.

To Serve:

* Divide the buttered noodles between bowls and pile the beef stroganoff on top. Garnish with more parsley, if desired. Enjoy!

* 4 cups small broccoli florets (about 1 head
* 1 1/2 cups jasmine or white rice
* 1 chopped green onion
* 1–2 tablespoons canola/vegetable
* 1 tablespoon sesame seeds for garnish
* ground pepper, to taste

**Sauce**

* 1/2 cup warm/hot water
* 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce
* 3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* rounded tablespoon corn starch
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1/2 teaspoon sriracha
* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger (or 1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger)

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl starting with the water and sugar first. Whisk to combine. Set aside. Sauce can be made ahead and stored in the fridge.
2. Thinly slice flank steak into 1/4 inch thick strips **against** the grain. **This part is very important for tenderness. Cut strips into 2-inch bite-sized pieces.**
3. Cook rice according to the directions on the package.
4. Meanwhile, bring skillet to medium heat. Add 1/2 cup water and broccoli. Cook broccoli, tossing occasionally until just starting to tenderize, about 5 minutes. The water helps steam the broccoli and prevents burning. If the water evaporates, add a splash more. Broccoli should not be raw but still a little snappy.
5. Transfer broccoli to a bowl and add oil to the skillet. Add steak in a single layer and season liberally with pepper. Cook for about 1-2 minutes per side or until no longer pink.
6. Add sauce to the skillet and bring to a simmer. As soon as it bubbles, reduce heat to low and let thicken, about 1-2 minutes. Add broccoli and toss with the steak until everything is coated. if sauce gets too thick add a little warm water. Top with green onion and sesame seeds. Serve over white rice.

jem3j5,Homemade Hot Dry Noodles,2363,34,"Reganmian is a traditional Chinese dish where noodles are served with flavourful beef stock - lou mei and other garnishes like crushed peanuts, pickled carrots or beans, sesame sauce, soy sauce, fresh garlic, chilli oil, coriander and scallions.

Noodles are the main element of this dish so making fresh is the best way to go. My favourite is Udon, easy to make and tastes fantastic, I bet you will enjoy it as much as I did at the moment when everything mixes together and you take the first bite.

You don't have to add all of the toppings to make it delicious. Instead of chilli oil, I used my homemade chilli sauce and it worked great. I also pickled carrot with my quick hot pickle.

**Ingredients for Udon:**

* 500g (17.6oz) of plain flour
* 250g (8.8oz) of warm water
* 20g (0.7oz) of salt
* cornstarch for dusting

**Ingredients for lou mei:**

* 400ml (0.42quarts) of beef or stock
* 3tbsp sesame oil
* 20g (0.7oz) of fresh ginger peeled and sliced
* 3 garlic cloves peeled and sliced
* 1 small shallot sliced
* 1spring onion sliced
* 3tbsp Shaoxing wine
* 1tbsp brown sugar

**Spices for lou mei:**

* 2 small cinnamon sticks
* 3 bay leaves
* 10 peppercorns
* 20 fennel seeds
* 10 cloves
* 5 cardamon pods
* 3 star anise

📷📷

**Instructions for Noodles (4 portions) :**

**1.** Dissolve the salt in warm water and mix into the flour, knead for **8 minutes** until a smooth dough ball is formed (it may be hard at the beginning but it will soften as gluten forms) Then rest it covered to prevent drying for **30 minutes**.

📷📷

**2.** After resting it is time for final kneading and the easiest way to get it done is by placing the dough in a plastic bag and stepping on it until it spreads out then folding it into a ball again and repeating this two more times. You can also roll it with a pin but it is a lot harder to do so. After you finish rest the dough for at least **2 hours or overnight**.

**3.** Roll the dough flat to **1/4 of an inch** then fold it on itself and slice equal noodles.

**4.** Boil the noodles in salty water for **12 minutes** (do it in 3 batches) then run them  under cold water to set the starch on the outer surface (this makes them silkier and prevents from sticking)

**5.** To serve the noodles, deep them in boiling water for **15 seconds** then place in the bowl, add a small ladle of lou mei and garnish with other toppings.

**Instructions for Lou mei:**

**1.** Heat **3tbsp of sesame oil** in a medium pan then add, garlic, ginger and onion. Fry for couple minutes then add seven spices, fry for another couple minutes to release the aroma.

**2.** Add Shaoxing wine, beef stock and brown sugar then simmer for about **30-60 minutes.**

**3.** Once ready you can store in the fridge for up to 4 days.

 **Quick Pickled Carrot:**

* 100g (3.5oz) carrot, peeled and chopped into matchsticks
* 100ml (0.1quarts) of red wine vinegar
* 50g (1.8oz) of brown sugar

Combine vinegar and sugar then bring to boil and remove from the heat, add carrot matchsticks and make sure it is submerged. After 15 minutes the pickle is ready, you can store it in the fridge for future use.

📷📷  
**Homemade Chilli sauce:**

* 5 chillis (green or red) seeds removed
* 20g (0.7oz) of ginger, peeled and diced
* 8tbsp of chopped tomato
* 1/2 lime juice
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 4tbsp rapeseed oil

Blend everything together in a food processor, it makes more than you need for this recipe so you can store it for the future in the fridge.

irutc3,Mexican Slow Cooked Chilli Beef Quesadilla,3035,41,"I love slow-cooking, it is magical how it changes a relatively cheap cut of meat into delicious food!

**6.** Remove from the pan and cut in half before serving, enjoy!

Insight:

* Meat surface browning intensifies the flavour thanks to Millard reactions. In the process, carbohydrates react with amino acids creating hundreds of delicious compounds.
* At a temperature of 70C (158F) connective tissue collagen begins to dissolve into gelatin making meat significantly more tender.

Author: Kylie Perrotti

### Equipment

* Wide braising pot or soup pot
* Food processor

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil
* 2 pounds chuck roast cut into cubes
* 4 celery stalks a few leaves reserved for garnish
* 2 medium onions peeled
* 2 tablespoons harissa paste
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1/4 cup flour
* 4 large carrots trimmed, scrubbed and cut into thirds
* 3-4 cups beef stock
* 1 28- ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes
* 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* Cayenne powder to taste
* ½ teaspoon celery salt
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Heavy cream optional, for serving
* Olive oil for browning the beef

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Aromatics:

* Add the onion and celery stalks (with leaves) to a food processor and pulse until roughly chopped. Remove some additional celery leaves from the stalk and mince and reserve for garnish. 

#### Brown the beef:

* Pat the beef dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed soup pot or braising pan. Once very hot, brown the beef in batches. Cook the beef cubes for 3-5 minutes on each side until well browned and crisping up around the edges. *Note: If there seems to be a lot of excess oil in the pot, you can drain it off, but don’t remove anything stuck to the bottom of the skillet.*

#### Start the Stew:

* Add the celery and onions to the hot pot and cook for 5 minutes or until softened. Add the harissa paste and tomato paste and cook for 3-5 minutes or until the paste starts to turn a deeper red color. Add the flour and stir to coat everything in the pot and cook for 1 minute more.
* Add the beef stock and reduce heat to medium low and whisk continuously until the flour is completely incorporated into the liquid and the broth is smooth. Add the can of tomatoes and their liquid.
* Add the cumin, paprika, ground ginger, garlic powder, cayenne powder to taste and celery salt. Season with salt and pepper.
* Carefully add the beef and the carrots and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and cook for at least 1 hour 30 minutes, stirring occasionally throughout cooking.

#### Finish the Stew:

* Taste the stew and season to your liking. Use a spoon to lightly mash some of the tomatoes to break them up a bit.

#### Shred the Beef:

* Remove the beef cubes from the pot and transfer to a bowl and lightly shred the meat and return it back to the pot. *Note: You do not have to completely shred the beef; simply break apart some of the cubes. You will want a mix of some shredded and some cubed beef throughout the stew.*

#### To Serve:

* Ladle a few spoonfuls of the stew between bowls. Sprinkle a few minced celery leaves on top and drizzle with heavy cream, if desired. Enjoy!

3. Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in an oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the pork tenderloin and cook for 4–5 minutes per side until browned all over. Transfer to a plate.

**Prepare the potatoes:**

1. While the pork fries, place the potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 20–25 minutes or until fork tender. Scoop out ¼ cup of the potato water, drain the potatoes, and return them to the pot. Keep warm.

Inactive time: 15 minutes

Total Time: 50 minutes

Servings: 4

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup low-sodium chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
* 1 heaping tablespoon dark brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon cooking oil
* 4 thick bone-in pork chops
* 4 firm bosc or red d’anjou pears trimmed, cored, seeds removed, and cut into wedges
* 2 shallots peeled and cut into wedges
* 8 ounces fresh baby spinach
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prepare sauce:**

1. In a bowl, prepare the sauce by whisking together the chicken stock, mustard, and brown sugar.
2. Fry the pork chops: Preheat oven to 400ºF. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the pork chops and cook without moving for 5 minutes until well browned. Flip and cook an additional 5 minutes until golden brown. Do not overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if needed. Transfer the pork chops to a plate.

**Cook the pears:**

1. Add the pears and shallots to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes per side until the pears are golden brown all over. Season lightly with salt and pepper to taste. Pour the sauce over the pears and toss gently to coat. Turn off the heat and nestle the pork chops into the pears.

**Bake:**

1. Transfer the skillet or braising pot to the oven and bake for about 15 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 140º-145ºF at the thickest part of the chop.

**Cook the Spinach:**

1. Meanwhile, carefully stir the spinach into the pears until wilted. If necessary, put the skillet on low heat on the stove, but the skillet should be warm enough that the spinach wilts with no additional heat. Taste and season to your preference with salt and pepper.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the pears and spinach between plates and place a pork chop on top. Spoon more sauce over the entire dish.

**Ingredients:**

* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced
* 4 tablespoons butter, divided
* 5 scallions, minced; white and green parts kept separate
* 1 cup carnaroli or arborio rice
* 6 cups warm water or chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 pound broccoli, cut into florets
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
* ¾ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
* ½ lemon, juiced
* 4 boneless, thick-sliced center-cut pork chops (1 pound total)
* Freshly minced parsley, optional, for serving
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the risotto:**

1. Preheat the oven to 425ºF.
2. Turn the heat on a large pot to medium. Add the mushrooms and cook, occasionally turning as they release water. The water will evaporate over 8–10 minutes. Once the water from the mushrooms evaporates, turn the heat to medium-high and add 2 tablespoons of butter. Cook for 4-5 minutes until they brown and crisp up around the edges. Add salt and pepper.
3. Add the scallion whites to the mushrooms. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the carnaroli rice and cook for 1–2 minutes. Add a pinch of salt. *\*See Note*
4. Begin ladling in the warm water or stock, 1 cup at a time. Stir after each addition and only add more liquid once the rice absorbs the liquid in the pot. Continue adding the liquid until 5 cups have been incorporated. Taste the risotto to see if the rice is tender. The liquid in the pot should be creamy. Add the remaining 1 cup of water only if needed and stir after adding it. Taste and add salt and pepper. This process will take 20–25 minutes.
5. Once the rice is tender, turn off the heat. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, half of the minced scallion greens, and the Parmesan cheese until melted. Add the lemon juice. Taste and season once more.

**Roast the broccoli:**

1. Arrange the broccoli florets on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.
2. As soon as you add the carnaroli rice to the pot for the risotto, transfer the broccoli to the oven. Roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover with foil. Keep warm and keep the oven heated to 425ºF.

**Cook the pork chops:**

1. Pat the pork chops dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops and cook for 3–4 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven for 15–17 minutes. Once the pork chops reach 140ºF, remove them from the oven and rest on a cutting board for 5–10 minutes.
3. Slice the pork chops thinly and arrange on a serving platter with the roasted broccoli.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the risotto into shallow bowls. Arrange the sliced pork chop on top and serve with the broccoli on the side. Garnish with freshly minced parsley and the remaining minced scallion greens. Enjoy!

Notes:

**Ingredients**  


* 600 g Pork Shoulder chopped into 3/4 inch cubes
* 1 tbsp Light Soy Sauce
* 2 Eggs beaten
* 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
* 1 cup Cornstarch
* Canola Oil for frying
* 2 Scallions finely sliced

**Sweet and Sour Sauce**  


* 1.5 cups Orange Juice
* 4 tbsp White Sugar
* 3 tbsp Tomato Paste
* 4 tbsp Ketchup
* 5 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar
* 1 Red Bell Pepper roughly chopped
* 1 Spanish Onion roughly chopped
* 1.5 cups Pineapple Chunks
* 4 tbsp Cornstarch mixed with 6 tbsp water  


**Instructions**  


1. Place the pork chunks in a large bowl, add the beaten egg, soy sauce and salt and mix well, ensuring all the pork is coated in the egg mixture.
2. Tip the cornstarch into a seperate bowl then add the pork and stir to coat in cornstarch, shaking off any excess.
3. Fill a wok 2/3 full of oil and heat to 350 F. Fry the pork pieces in batches for about 2 to 3 minutes, or when they just start to get golden brown. Remove them from the oil and transfer to a sheet pan with a slotted spoon.
4. In a large saucepan over medium high heat, add 1 tbsp or oil, red bell pepper and onion. Sautee for 3-4 minutes until slightly tender but still crunchy.
5. Add the orange juice, white sugar, tomato paste, ketchup, vinegar and pineapple chunks. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Slowly stir in the cornstarch slurry, stirring continuously, until you have the desired consistency. Add water to thin out the sauce if required. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Set aside.
7. Once you’re ready to combine everything, refry the pork in batches to crisp up the coating. Frying the pork twice prevents it from getting too soggy when added to the sauce.

**Pork chops and braised red cabbage:**

* ½ pound thick sliced bacon, cut into lardons
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 4 thick-cut, bone-in pork chops
* 1 pound head of red cabbage, cored and chopped
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
* 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard
* 1 orange, juiced
* ½ cup water
* Salt and pepper

**Golden beet relish:**

* 1 teaspoon caraway seeds
* 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
* Flaky sea salt, to taste
* 2 medium golden beets, peeled and finely diced
* 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard
* 1 shallot, peeled and finely diced
* 1 Serrano pepper, trimmed and finely diced
* 1 orange, juiced
* ¼ cup distilled white vinegar
* ¼ cup maple syrup
* ⅓ cup water, plus more if needed

**For serving:**

* Roasted or mashed potatoes

**Preheat oven to 350ªF.**

**Prepare the relish:**

1. Place fennel seeds and caraway seeds in a small skillet, crushing the seeds between your fingers as you sprinkle them in. Add a pinch of flaky sea salt. Turn the heat to medium and toast for 45 seconds. Add the golden beets, mustard, shallot, and Serrano pepper and cook for 3–4 minutes, turning occasionally, until they begin to warm through completely.
2. Pour in the orange juice, vinegar, maple syrup, and 1/3 cup water. Season with salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low and simmer for 30–45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the relish becomes jammy and sticky. Add more water as needed to loosen up the relish as needed. Taste and season once more.

**Cook the bacon:**

1. Place the diced bacon in a wide pot over medium heat. Cook, turning often until the fat completely renders from the bacon and the bacon crisps up. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour all but 1 tablespoon of rendered bacon fat into a heat-proof glass.

**Brown the pork chops:**

1. Pat the pork chops dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Add 1 tablespoon neutral oil to the 1 tablespoon bacon fat in the pot. Add the pork chops and cook without moving for 3–5 minutes per side until browned. Brown the fat caps for 1–2 minutes and then transfer the pork chops to a baking sheet. Transfer to the oven for 15–20 minutes or until the pork chops reach desired internal temperature, 135ºF–140ºF is ideal for medium-rare as the chop will rest up to 145ºF.
3. Remove the pork chops from the oven and tent them with foil.

**Prepare the cabbage:**

1. Drain and discard the oil in the pot. Heat up 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat. Once hot, add the diced cabbage and season all over with salt and pepper to taste. Add the sugar, orange juice, distilled white vinegar, and mustard. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is tender, 15–20 minutes. Stir all but a pinch of the cooked bacon into the cabbage. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the braised cabbage between plates and place a pork chop on top. Spoon the golden beet relish on top of each chop. Sprinkle the rest of the crispy bacon on top of each dish. Serve alongside roasted potatoes if you like.

**EQUIPMENT**

* Steamer (a bamboo steamer or a large metal pot steamer)
* 12 parchment paper squares (cut into 3 X 3 inches)
* 1/2 cup vinegar for steaming

**INGREDIENTS**

**Dough**

* 1 package of Kim Tu Thap (Bot Banh Bao) with yeast
* 1 cup warm milk
* ½ cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 tbsp oil
* 1 tbsp white vinegar

**Filling**

* ¾ lbs ground pork (fatty ground pork is okay)
* 3 tbsp wood ear mushroom
* ½ cup of onion
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp fish sauce
* 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* 1 tsp sugar
* ½ tsp salt
* 1/8 tsp black pepper
* 2 Chinese sausage links, thinly sliced
* 12 quail eggs, cooked and peeled

**INSTRUCTIONS**

**Making the premix dough**

1. Mix the warm milk with the yeast from the banh bao package. Let it sit and work its magic for 10 minutes. If you are using a stand mixer you can add these ingredients to the mixer bowl.
2. Once the yeast has worked its magic add oil and vinegar and add the mixer attachment. In a medium-sized bowl mix the dry ingredients together, the flour, sugar and salt.
3. Swap the attachment to the dough hook and add the dry ingredients and mix on low first and gradually increase the speed to medium-low. I let it work the dough until it's well mixed. Roughly 2 minutes. Avoid over-kneading in the mixer to create a light and fluffy bao.
4. Add a small pinch of flour to a clean surface. Take the dough out of the bowl and use your hands to knead the dough using the palm of your hands. Continues until the dough is nice and smooth. Let it sit for 1 hour to allow it to rise. Best to place it somewhere warm.

**Prepare the pork filling, quail eggs and Chinese sausage**

1. Boil the quail eggs until they are cooked and peel. Set aside.
2. Take 2 sausages and slice them at an angle to get a nice oval-shaped sausage. I cut them roughly 1/8 inch. Set aside.
3. Take the ground pork, add the wood ear mushrooms, onion, sesame oil, fish sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, salt and black pepper. Mix it well and set aside to marinade for about 10 minutes.
4. Portion out 12 pork fillings and roll them into a ball and set aside.

**Assembling the bao**

1. Once the dough has doubled in size take the dough and divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Use a scale to portion out evenly.
2. Using a rolling pin to roll out a circle roughly 3.5-4 inches wide. Place the pork filling, quail egg and 2-3 slices of Chinese sausage in the center.
3. Two ways to pleat the bao:

***Method 1 (more work but looks cute)***

1. Using your primary hand form a small fold with your thumb and index finger. Hold the fold and using your opposite hand place your thumb underneath and your index finger on top and push the dough towards the fold to form the second pleat. You are looking to make an accordion fold. Continue forming these pleats while at the same time rotating the bao until you reach the end.
2. There will likely be a hole at the top. Using both hands gently close the hole by squeezing it close.
3. Give it a gentle twirl and that’s it!
4. Place on top of parchment paper square.

***Method 2 (quick and easy but not as pretty)***

1. Grab the opposite ends and bring the dough together over the filling.
2. On the opposite sides that bring the other sides over. It’s like wrapping the filling up
3. Using both hands seal the center, making sure there are no openings.
4. Place the bao on top of parchment paper square .

**Steaming**

1. Prepare the steamer by adding water and ½ cup white vinegar. Make sure to add enough water to steam multiple batches if your steamer is smaller. I steam in 2 batches.
2. Once the water is boiling turn the heat to medium-high and add the baos. Steam for 20 minutes per batch.

**Note:** Using premix Banh Bao flour yields fluffy bao. I also have a homemade dough recipe which can be found on the link above if you are not able to find the premix flour in the store.",1668986494000,0.9702148438,Pork,CookwithChung,https://i.redd.it/nj59muorv61a1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z0ip7d/vietnamese_steamed_pork_buns_banh_bao/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z0ip7d/vietnamese_steamed_pork_buns_banh_bao/,Spicy pork bao buns,160.0,0.5,3.0,6.0,1.0,23.0,8.0,1.0,

**Instructions**

1. Optional step – Brine and parboil the riblets. Soak the pork riblets in water and salt for 30 minutes. Heat up a pot of water and add the riblets and let it boil for 5 minutes to remove all the impurities.
2. Heat up a pan on medium-high heat and add oil. Once the oil is hot enough add the garlic and shallots and fry until light golden brown.
3. Add the pork riblets and cook until there is a light golden color on all sides. I do this for about 6-7 minutes. This will vary depending on your stove.
4. Add the dark soy sauce, regular soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, rice vinegar, Chinese cooking wine and water. Turn the heat to simmer on medium-low and cover the pot partially. Cook for roughly 30 minutes and keep stirring every 10 minutes.
5. Remove the lid and turn the heat to medium. Keep stirring the pork riblets occasionally so it does not burn. Roughly 10 minutes or until all the liquid has evaporated. The Asian pork riblets will be a nice dark colour with a nice glaze.

(I would lightly salt since we will be cooking down the sauce and pork is already salty) Add to the pot, browning each side. Work in batches if they do not all fit--it's best not to overcrowd the pot! Remove the ribs and place aside.
	3.	 Add onions and cook until softened. Add garlic and ginger and stir for another minute. Add ginger ale, vegetable stock, and beef broth. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and add in star anise, soy sauce, Worcestershire, and brown sugar and paprika. Stir until combined and add in ribs with any excess juices.
	4.	 Let simmer on the stove top for another 20 minutes. Place a top on the pot and transfer to the oven for 2-2.5 hours.
	5.	 Remove ribs from the pot and set aside.  Strain the remaining sauce and then Heat the remaining liquid in the pot on medium heat letting it simmer till it is half the volume.(roughly one hour) if you would like the sauce thicker mix your cornstarch and water. whisking until it dissolved completely and begins to thicken. (Optional: You can slowly add in more cornstarch if you want your sauce thicker


6. Keep your ribs warm in the oven while your sauce thickens. Then when ready remove from oven and carefully remove bones as to not break apart the meat. Then cut ribs into square bite size pieces and add back to pot with sauce.

q1olns,Scotch Eggs,1877,59,"Certainly not the quickest recipe, and to be honest not as good as you can get buying from people that make them for a living, but as a British expat this is as close as I can get.

Recipe lightly modified from here: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/scotcheggs\_85851](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/scotcheggs_85851)

**Ingredients:**

For the sausage meat:

\- 1lb lean minced pork

\- 20g Stuffing Mix (Bland as possible so American style preferably. I used Stove Top pork)- Freshly ground Pepper

\- 2 tsp fresh thyme

\- 1 tsp parsley flakes

\- 1 tsp sage

\- 2 small shallots, very finely chopped

&amp;#x200B;

For the scotch eggs:

\- 6 medium eggs

\- 80g plain flower, seasoned with salt and pepper

\- 1 egg beaten

\- 3 slices of white bread, lightly toasted then ground into breadcrumbs

\- vegetable oil, for frying

&amp;#x200B;

**Method**

\- Combine all the ingredients for the sausage meat together in a medium bowl, mix thoroughly. Meat can be covered and stored in fridge for later use.

\- Place the eggs, unbroken, in cold salted water. Bring to the boil then immediately reduce tempreature and simmer for 9 min. (You may have to do this in stages, if so you only need to let the water cool to warm between batches)

\- When the eggs are finished strain and cool under running water. Then peel off the shells, if you haven't done this before I recommend looking up a video, fingernails help.

\- Take the sausage meet and divide into sixths on a clean cutting board, before flattening each into a shallow oval \~1/4"" thick.

\- Spread the seasoned flower onto a large plate. One at a time take a peeled egg and dredge it in flower until a thin coating sticks to all surfaces, before placing the egg at the center of the flattened sausage meat, and wrapping the meat around it and gently rolling to form a smooth egg shaped ball.

\- Prepare the breadcrumbs, I used a stick blender and a tall cup to get them fine enough. Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate. One at a time coat the meat wrapped eggs in the beaten egg mixture before rolling in bread crumbs enough to ensure a even coating on all surfaces.

\- With all the eggs prepared select a high walled pot and fill with oil, quantity will vary based on pot selection but ideally should be enough to completely submerge the prepared egg. **Important:** Do not fill the pot anywhere near to full, remember when you place eggs in the oil level will rise and we do not want it to boil over. Heat the oil until a loose breadcrumb placed in it will bubble and brown in around 30s. (I found this was around 370F)

\- The eggs will be cooked for \~9 min in the hot oil. I suggest using a slotted spoon to place and remove them. I encourage you to monitor the oil tempreature yourself, either by thermometer or look and feel and suggest you open up the first egg cooked and determine if any adjustments need to be made. It will all be relative to your setup but I cooked the eggs two at a time on alternating cycles, one egg removed every four and a half minutes, my oil temperature remained fairly constant at \~320F, and I rotated the eggs twice to ensure even cooking.

\- **Important:** Usual safety precautions when working with hot oil apply, always use long implements to place eggs into the oil preferably from the side of the pot. Be aware of the temperament of the oil, sizzling is good bubbling is worrying. Be aware of the level of the oil as you add and remove the eggs. Finally as I was working in a small pot I took the step of turning off the gas every time I added a egg to prevent risk of flare up if the oil overflowed.

\- When the eggs are finished place them on a sheet of kitchen roll to absorb excess oil. Personal preference is to serve chilled or at room temperature, though they can be eaten warm after allowing some time to cool.  


  
**Improvements**  
This is probably the simplest least creative recipe for scotch eggs out there, I was deliberately aiming for generic. It does however make it completely open to adaptation/improvement. If I were to make it again I would definitely attempt to address the slightly bland breadcrumbs, I suspect the answer may be more salt but I also want to see if some herbs (perhaps sage) add some complexity to the flavor.",1633417037000,0.9599609375,Pork,EminusVulneratis,https://i.redd.it/ziwqu8xymkr71.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/q1olns/scotch_eggs/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/q1olns/scotch_eggs/,Scotch eggs,590.0,2.49,41.0,2.0,12.0,27.0,30.0,1.0,0.9

Ingredients:

-7lb bone-in skinless pork shoulder

-5 cloves garlic, crushed

-1 inch piece of ginger, thinly sliced

-2 green onion

-2/3cup hoisin sauce

-1/3cup rice wine

-1/2cup honey

-1/2cup soy sauce

-1tsp white pepper

-2tsp star anise powder

-red food dye, optional

Instructions:

 1. Make the marinade by pouring 2/3cup hoisin sauce, 1/3cup rice wine, 1/2cup honey, 1/2cup soy sauce, 1tsp white pepper, and 2tsp star anise powder in a cup/bowl.  Add red food dye if you want that classic char siu look.  Stir to combine.
 
2. Place the pork shoulder in a sealable bag or pot.  Add in the garlic, ginger, and green onion.  Then pour in the marinade.  Remove any excess air from the bag and seal tight.
 
3. Let the pork marinade for 12-24 hours in the fridge.  The longer the better.

4. When the pork is done marinating, pour the leftover marinade into a saucepan.

5. Cook the pork in a preheated 250F oven for about 12 hours or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 200F.  Cooking time will vary depending on the pork's weight and your oven.  You can also use a grill or smoker instead of the oven.  Cover the pork with foil after about an hour to prevent burning.
 
6. While the pork cooks, bring the marinade to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce the marinade into a sauce until you achieve your desired thickness.  Keep in mind the marinade will thicken after it cools.  Remove the garlic, ginger, and green onion when done and let cool before storing in the fridge.
 
7. After the pork is done, remove the shoulder bone and pull the meat apart using two forks.

mtbrwd,Cochinita Pibil Tacos with Pickled Red Onion &amp; Homemade Cornmeal Tortillas,2308,66,"Cochinita Tacos are one of the most popular foods in the Mexican region of Yucatan. Pork meat is prepared by marinating in a unique spice blend called Red Recado and slow-cooked in fruit juices over a period of 21 hours. The meat is then mixed with the cooking juices, served on a corn tortilla with red onion pickle. Taco is garnished with cilantro or parsley. Sometimes salsa or guacamole is also served as a topping but it is a personal preference.

At home, I used a slow-cooker on a low setting. 8 pm start for the overnight cook, meat was ready lunchtime on the following day. The only side effect of this method of cooking is sleepless night as the delicious aromas keep you awake...

## What kind of meat is used for Cochinita Pibil Tacos?

Traditionally, hairless Mexican pig is used for Cochinitas. For the top-quality meat, pigs are raised in an organic setting, fed with a variety of fruit, grass, grains and vegetables. Papaya is their most beloved feed on the menu giving the pork a unique flavour. Almost all parts of the animal are used for recipe ranging from ears, cheeks, main body to offal.

To prepare Cochinitas at home I choose Pork shoulder as my preference. Next time I will definitely try ribs or belly.

Remember to choose the best quality meat from sources that respect animal life and consumers health!

**Ingredients (makes 3 servings)**

*Dragon Sauce*

* 1/4 cup chili garlic sauce (I'd use less if your spice tolerance isn't high)
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup brown sugar

*Pork and Noodles*
    
* 1/2 lb. ground pork* 
* 6 oz. ramen noodles 
* 3 green onions, sliced 
* 1/4 cup unsalted peanuts, chopped
* *Extra* - I added thin half slices of a zucchini for more veggies

**Instructions:**

1. Combine the chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar in a bowl.
2. Add the ground pork to a skillet and cook over medium heat until it is fully browned (add the zucchini a few minutes after you start cooking the pork). Once browned, add the prepared dragon sauce and chopped peanuts. Allow the pork, zucchini and peanuts to simmer in the sauce for another 5 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced by half.
3. While the pork is browning, begin boiling water for your noodles. Once boiling, add your noodles and cook according to the package directions. Drain the noodles in a colander.
4. Once the sauce has reduced and the noodles have drained, add the noodles to the skillet and toss until everything is combined and coated in sauce. Top with sliced green onions and serve!

**Note:** Instead of ramen noodles, I used frozen Udon noodles from the local Asian store. Also, the pork usually has enough fat where you don't need to use any extra oil in your skillet when cooking. If there is an excess amount of fat after browning, I suggest draining the meat and leaving 1 Tbsp fat in the skillet to combine with the dragon sauce.",1612238741000,0.9799804688,Pork,tarcoal,https://i.redd.it/0wx5u1nvnze61.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/lamzox/pork_and_peanut_dragon_noodles/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/lamzox/pork_and_peanut_dragon_noodles/,Sesame chicken noodles,505.0,1.1,24.0,8.0,5.0,28.0,31.0,9.0,0.8400000000000001

Grind together all the ingredients for the masala, then stir in the vinegar. Rub into the pork and leave to sit for three to four hours.

Heat the oil in a wide, lidded pan over a medium-low flame, and fry the onions until soft and golden. Meanwhile, soak the tamarind pulp in 120ml of hot water for 15 minutes, then gently rub any remaining pulp from the seeds and strain off the liquid, discarding the solids.

Stir the garlic and ginger into the onions and cook, stirring, for another five minutes, then add the tomatoes, chillies and curry leaves, if using, and cook until the tomatoes start to break down.

Add the pork and marinade to the pan and turn the heat up to medium high. Stir well, add the jaggery, salt and mustard seeds, followed by the tamarind liquid. Bring to a simmer, cover tightly, turn the heat right down and cook gently for an hour.

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 45 minutes

Servings: 6 

Calories: 520kcal 

Author: Kylie Perrotti

### Equipment

* Wide pot

### Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon neutral cooking oil for frying
* 1 pound loose hot Italian sausage
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper optional
* 4 tablespoons butter divided
* 2 small leeks thoroughly washed, trimmed, and cut thinly into rounds
* 1½ cups arborio rice
* 4-5 cups hot chicken broth low-sodium
* 1 bunch Swiss chard stems removed, leaves chopped
* 2 ounces sage leaves chiffonaded
* ⅓ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

#### Brown the Sausage:

* Heat the cooking oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks, for 10-12 minutes until well-browned and cooked-through. Season with extra crushed red pepper, if desired. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
* Drain off excess fat from the pot, reserving any fond stuck to the bottom of the pot.

#### Cook the Leeks:

* Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the pot. Once frothy, add the leeks and cook for 8-10 minutes until very soft. Season lightly with salt and pepper.

#### Start the Rice:

* Melt the remaining butter in the pot and add the rice. Cook over medium heat, stirring regularly, for 2-3 minutes until just beginning to turn translucent.

#### Cook the Risotto:

* Add 1 ladle of the hot broth (it should be enough to mostly cover the rice in the pot) and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat to low and stir often for 2-3 minutes until most of the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding a ladle of liquid and stirring for a few minutes until absorbed until 4 cups of the liquid has been added. If you need more liquid, add another cup and allow the liquid to absorb.

#### Cook the Greens:

* Once most of the liquid has been absorbed, add the chopped Swiss chard, sage, and reserved cooked sausage. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring regularly, until the Swiss chard is wilted. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

#### Finish the Risotto:

* Turn the heat off the risotto and allow it to rest for 5 minutes. Grate the parmesan cheese into the pot and stir to incorporate.

#### To Serve:

* Divide the risotto between bowls and add a little more parmesan on top, if desired. Enjoy!

* Add the garlic, ginger, star anise, Szechuan peppercorn, and cinnamon stick to the water and keep over low heat (we need this water to be hot since we will be adding it back to the pork and if it gets cold then it might cause the meat to toughen up)
* Cut the pork belly into cubes about 1.5 inches on each side
* In a Dutch oven or large pot, start heating up the oil over medium-low heat. Add 3.5 tablespoons of the brown sugar. Let the sugar sit undisturbed until you see it start to melt. Once it starts melting, you can use a single chopstick to mix it up a bit to speed up the melting process
* When all the sugar has melted and turned into a dark amber color, add the pork belly. Cook while flipping the pieces for a few minutes until almost every side of each piece is covered with the caramel. Be gentle so you don’t break the pieces!
* Add the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine and cook for a minute. Then add the water with all the spices and aromatics. Braise the pork belly over medium-low heat for 2 hours, stirring once every 30 minutes
* After 2 hours, the pork should be fully tender. You can check by sticking a chopstick into the meat through the bottom. The chopstick should be able to easily pierce the entire piece. If you want it to be more tender, put the lid back on and keep braising until it reaches your desired tenderness
* Remove the lid and raise the heat to medium. Add the remaining 3.5 tablespoons of sugar and mix. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the sauce has reduced significantly and thickened up. Stir every few minutes to prevent the meat from burning. You’ll know it’s done when the sauce is thick enough to start sticking to the meat
* Remove the meat from the pot and then drizzle with some of the extra sauce. Serve hot with a side of rice and vegetables

**Directions:**

1. Cut the pork belly into 2mm slices, cut the chili peppers into strips, and chop the garlic and ginger.
2. Turn on the heat (medium to high), stir fry the pork belly. No oil is needed because the pork belly will release a lot of naturally occurring oil.

ikoo94,Thai Pork Stuffed Cucumber Soup,1263,37,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Thai Pork Cucumber Soup**](https://triedtrue.us/PorkCucumberSoup)

Someone told me about Chrissy Teigan’s Thai pork stuffed cucumber soup and I knew I wanted to try making my own version of it. 

The woman who posted it to our group shared Chrissy Teigan's recipe and she said she felt like the version she ate growing up had more cilantro or spices in it. I did a little hunting and found a version on Cookpad by Kanya from Thailand which uses LOTS of cilantro. Kanya's version uses tofu, which I didn’t have, so I omitted that.

Obviously, both versions are probably equally tasty, but I was definitely intrigued by the white pepper in the pork from Kanya's recipe, so that's what I used as my starting point.

This is a really easy recipe and a unique take on a really cheap veggie that most of us are probably swimming in this time of year!

# SUBSTITUTIONS:

Ground Pork: Ground chicken or ground turkey

Cucumber: Seedless or seeded, doesn't matter

Ground White Pepper: Use black pepper instead – it won't have exactly the same flavor, but it's ok.

You can follow Kanya's method and add tofu to it, as well!

# RECIPE

## Equipment

* Large pot

## Ingredients

## Pork Mixture

* 1 pound ground pork
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* ½ tablespoon sesame oil
* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 teaspoon ground white pepper
* ¼ cup fresh cilantro leaves and stems minced (see note)

## Cucumber Soup:

* 2 large cucumbers
* 6 cups water or low-sodium chicken stock
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* ½ tablespoon sesame oil
* 1 bunch cilantro stems minced (see note)
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 scallion minced; white and green parts separated
* Salt, to taste
* Sesame seeds optional, for garnish

## Instructions

## Prepare the Broth:

* Combine the water, soy sauce, sesame oil, minced cilantro stems, black pepper, sriracha, and white part of the scallion in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.

## Prepare the Cucumbers:

* Peel the cucumbers and cut into three or four pieces depending on the length. Using the back of a spoon, hallow out the seeds and discard them. Set aside.

## Prepare the Pork Mixture:

* In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the pork and mix until well-combined.

## Stuff the Cucumbers:

* Carefully stuff the cucumbers with the pork. Roll any remaining pork into small meatballs.

## Boil the Cucumbers:

* Turn the heat on the broth to a vigorous simmer. Carefully drop the cucumbers and meatballs into the soup and cook for about 15-20 minutes until the pork is completely cooked through and the cucumbers have softened. Turn off the heat.

## To Serve:

* Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with extra cilantro leaves, minced green part of the scallion, and sesame seeds. Enjoy!

## Notes

*In this recipe, you can use 1* [*small*](https://www.wikihow.com/video/f/fd/Chop%20Cilantro%20Step%207%20Version%202.360p.mp4) *bunch of cilantro. Cut the cilantro right beneath where the bunch becomes leafy and mince the stems. Use about 1/4 cup of the leaves for the meatballs and use any remaining cilantro as garnish. If you have a very large bunch,  just use discretion on how much cilantro you want to use!*

Read more about this recipe: [Thai Style Fish &amp; Prawn Curry - Chefs Binge](https://chefsbinge.com/thai-style-fish-prawn-curry/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for Curry:**

\* 7 oz Raw king prawns - (200g) You can use frozen ones

\* 10 oz White fish - (300g) Cod or Haddock

\* 2 cans Coconut milk

\* 3 tbsp Red curry paste

\* 3 Potatoes, medium sized - (16oz) peeled and diced

\* 1 Carrot, large

\* 1 oz Spinach - a good handful

\* ½ Lime, juice only

\* Salt to taste

\* Fish sauce - (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

**Garnish:**

\* Fresh coriander

\* Chilli flakes

\* Sweet chilli paste

&amp;#x200B;

**To Serve:**

\* 8.5 oz Rice vermicelli noodles - (240g)

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

**1.** In a blender, combine the roughly chopped white fish fillets and one can of coconut cream. Blend until smooth. This unique blend will serve as the creamy base for your curry.

**2.** In a large saucepan or wok, heat a bit of oil over medium heat. Add the red curry paste and fry for a minute or two until it becomes aromatic. This step is crucial for releasing the flavors of the curry.

**3.** Pour the blended fish-coconut mixture into the saucepan with the curry paste. Mix well to ensure the curry paste is evenly distributed.

**4.** Add the second can of coconut cream to the saucepan and stir well. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce will begin to thicken and the flavors will meld together.

**5.** Add the diced potatoes and sliced carrots to the simmering sauce. Cover and let it simmer for approximately 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

**6.** Once the vegetables are cooked, add the king prawns to the curry. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and fully cooked. Be cautious not to overcook them.

**7.** Fold in a handful of fresh spinach right before you're ready to serve. The residual heat will wilt the spinach without overcooking it.

**8.** Taste and adjust the seasoning of your curry. You might want to add salt, a splash of lime juice for a tangy kick, and a little fish sauce for extra umami. If to thick adjust with a little bit of water.

**9.** Garnish with fresh coriander if desired, and serve your Thai-style fish and prawn curry while it's warm. It pairs beautifully with rice vermicelli noodles for a complete meal, offering a delightful texture contrast to the creamy curry.

Cook time: 1 hour

Serves: 4

**Fish salpicón:**

* 1 cup loosely packed cilantro, minced
* 4 scallions, trimmed and minced; a few scallion greens reserved for garnish
* 1 bird’s eye chili, trimmed and minced; or use a small serrano or jalapeño
* ½ small red onion, peeled and minced
* 1 lime, juiced and zested
* 1 pound tilapia or cod
* 1 cup Wondra or all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil, plus more if needed
* Salt and pepper

**For serving:**

* Sliced radishes
* Sliced cucumber
* 8 small tortillas
* Guacamole or diced avocado

**Roasted potatoes:**

* 1½ pounds red potatoes, scrubbed and medium-diced
* 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon neutral oil
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* Cayenne powder to taste, optional
* 1 red bell pepper, trimmed, seeded, and roughly chopped
* ½ small red onion, peeled and roughly chopped
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Start the salpicón:**

1. Combine the minced cilantro, scallions, chili pepper, red onion, lime juice, and zest in a large bowl. Sprinkle lightly with salt and set aside.

**Make the roasted potatoes:**

1. Preheat oven to 425ºF.
2. Arrange the potatoes on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle the garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne powder if using. Mix to coat well and arrange in an even layer. Transfer to the oven for 15 minutes.
3. After 15 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and add the red bell pepper and red onion to the baking sheet. Drizzle with a teaspoon of neutral oil and sprinkle salt on top of the pepper and onion before mixing gently into the potatoes. Arrange in an even layer and return to the oven for 20–25 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the baking sheet in the warm oven as you finish the rest of the recipe.

**Cook the fish:**

1. Add 1 tablespoon neutral oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pat the tilapia dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Add the Wondra to a large bowl. Dip each tilapia filet in the Wondra and coat the fish evenly. Shake off any excess flour.
3. Transfer the fish to the hot skillet and cook in an even layer. Cook in batches if needed so as not to crowd the skillet. Fry until golden brown and crisp, about 3–5 minutes per side. As the filets reach 145ºF, transfer them to the bowl of minced herbs.
4. Once all the fish finishes cooking, use two forks to flake into the minced herbs and lime juice. Taste and adjust the seasonings.

**To serve:**

1. Pile the fish salpicón on top of tostada shells or charred tortillas and garnish with scallion greens, sliced cucumber, radishes, and guacamole or diced avocado if you like. Serve with the roasted potatoes on the side. Enjoy!

Equipment

* Wide pot
* Large saucepan

IngredientsSpicy Shrimp:

* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 shallot peeled and thinly sliced
* 5 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 4 Roma tomatoes cored and roughly chopped
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes
* 2 tablespoons butter optional
* ¾ cup dry white wine
* 2-3 cups chicken or vegetable stock plus more, as needed
* 1/2 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper more or less to taste
* 2 pounds large shrimp peeled and deveined (half chopped, half left whole)
* Salt and pepper to taste

Risotto:

* 4 tablespoons butter
* 2 cups carnaroli rice or arborio rice (cooking instructions may vary)
* 6 cups chicken or vegetable stock
* Salt to taste

For Serving (Optional):

* Dry or fresh minced parsley
* A drizzle of extra virgin olive oil

InstructionsStart the Spicy Shrimp:

* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 3-4 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.

Cook the Tomatoes:

* Add the chopped tomatoes and the cherry tomatoes and cook for 3-4 minutes more. Melt the butter into the pot. Once frothy, add the white wine and bring to a boil for 5 minutes to allow the wine to reduce slightly.

Simmer the Broth:

* Add the stock, starting with 2 cups. Season everything in the pot with salt, pepper, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes. Adding more stock, as necessary, if too much cooks off. There should be enough broth to coat about 1/4'' of the bottom of the pan, but it should not be soupy.

Cook the Risotto:

* First, warm the chicken stock (either in a small saucepan on the stove or in a large glass measuring cup in the microwave).
* Melt the butter into the large sauce pan over medium heat. Once melted, add the rice and cook, stirring regularly, until it begins to toast and turn golden brown, about 4-5 minutes.
* Ladle 1-2 cups of the broth into the rice and stir regularly. Once the liquid is mostly absorbed (do not let the rice stick), add another 1-2 cups. Continue adding ladles of stock until all of the stock is mostly absorbed and the rice is tender but not mushy, about 16-20 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest for 5 minutes. Season with salt.

Cook the Shrimp:

* As the risotto finishes cooking, add the shrimp to the broth and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-7 minutes until opaque and cooked through. Do not overcook. Turn off the heat and keep warm. Taste and season again to your preferences.

To Serve:

12dwv7k,Saffron Cod and Orzo with Guanciale Chili Oil and Frizzled Leeks,187,9,"**Recipe here originally: [Saffron Cod and Orzo with Guanciale Chili Oil](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/saffron-cod-and-orzo-with-guanciale-chili-oil/)**

**Frizzled leeks:**

* 1 leek, white and light green parts only, scrubbed and rinsed
* Vegetable oil

**Guanciale chili oil:**

* 4 ounces guanciale, bacon, or pancetta; small-diced
* 1 small shallot, peeled and finely diced
* 1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste
* ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
* ¼ cup chili oil
* 1–2 teaspoons maple syrup
* Pinch of salt, if needed

**Saffron cod and orzo:**

* Pinch of saffron, lightly crushed
* 2 tablespoons hot water
* 6 4-ounce portions of cod
* 1 fennel bulb with stalks; bulb cored and thinly sliced, stalks trimmed and thinly sliced into rounds, fronds reserved for garnish
* 1 shallot, peeled and sliced lengthwise into thin wedges
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 16 ounces orzo
* 5½ cups water or vegetable broth
* 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 lemon, juiced
* ¼ cup loosely packed parsley, minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prep the leek:**

1. Before beginning, prepare the leek as it takes the most time. Halve the leek lengthwise and very thinly slice both halves into 1/8-inch wide slivers. You may need to separate some of the layers of the leek and slice each layer separately. If you find bits of dirt deep within the leek, don’t fret. You can place all the leek slivers in a sieve and rinse again once more to remove any stubborn flecks of dirt.
2. Transfer the sliced leek to a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry to remove any excess water.

**Steep the saffron:**

1. Place the crushed saffron in a small bowl and cover it with 2 tablespoons of hot water. Set aside.

**Prepare the guanciale chili oil:**

1. Place the guanciale in a large pot (you’ll use this pot later for the orzo and cod!) and turn the heat to medium. Cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes until the fat renders and the guanciale becomes crispy.
2. Add the shallot, garlic, and crushed red pepper and cook for an additional 3 minutes, turning often and adjusting the heat as needed to prevent the garlic from browning. Once the shallot softens, and the garlic takes on a very light golden color, spoon the mixture into a bowl. Scoop out all but a tablespoon of the fat from the pot and add it to the bowl of guanciale.
3. Pour the extra virgin olive oil, chili oil, and maple syrup over the guanciale. Stir vigorously to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add more maple syrup, chili oil, or crushed red pepper, depending on your preferences.
4. The guanciale oil will keep in an airtight jar for up to 5 days.

**Prepare the saffron cod and orzo:**

1. Pat the cod dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Return the pot of remaining guanciale fat to medium heat. Add the sliced fennel bulb and stalks along with the sliced shallot. Season with salt and cook for 5–6 minutes until the fennel begins to soften.
3. Add the garlic and cook for 1–2 minutes until just fragrant.
4. Melt the butter into the pot and add the orzo. Stir to coat and cook for 1–2 minutes until it begins to lightly toast. Season with salt.
5. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil for 2–3 minutes. Stir often to lift up any orzo that may have stuck to the bottom.
6. Reduce heat to low and arrange the cod on top. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Drizzle the steeped saffron mixture all over, ensuring that each piece of cod gets a little bit of saffron water.
7. Cover and simmer over low heat for 12–15 minutes or until the cod is opaque and the orzo is tender.

**Frizzle the leek:**

1. *Note: Use a saucepan that has somewhat high sides. Generally, you want a saucepan that’s at least 6–8 inches deep. When you add the leeks to the hot oil, the oil will foam up vigorously, and you do NOT want it pouring over the edges.*
2. As the cod simmers, make the leeks. In a saucepan, pour in 2 inches of vegetable oil. Turn the heat to medium-high. Break off a piece of leek and add it to the pot; if it bubbles rapidly, it’s ready to fry.
3. Working in small batches, add a handful of the leeks at a time to the oil. Stir occasionally and fry for 15–20 seconds until golden brown. Remove and–using tongs–transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Continue on until all the leeks are fried. Pat any excess oil off from the tops of the leeks with a paper towel and season with flaky sea salt. Set aside.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the cooked orzo into shallow bowls and place a piece of cod on top. Arrange the frizzled leeks next to the cod and drizzle with the guanciale chili oil. Sprinkle a few bits of fennel fronds on top if you remember (unlike me…).

Prep Time: 45 minutes

Cook Time: 1 hour

Total Time: 1 hour 45 minutes 

Servings: 12 tacos 

Calories: 304kcal

**Equipment**

* Whisk
* Food processor
* Skillet or baking sheet
* Large pot
* Meat or deep-fry thermometer

**Ingredients**

**Slaw:**

* ½ small head green or red cabbage, trimmed and sliced paper-thin
* ½ small red onion, peeled and sliced paper-thin
* 1 serrano or jalapeño pepper, trimmed and minced
* ⅓ cup loosely packed cilantro, minced
* ¼ cup distilled white vinegar
* 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
* 1 lime, juiced
* Salt

**Jalapeño-avocado cream cheese:**

* ¼ of a small red onion, peeled
* 1–2 jalapeños or serrano peppers, depending on heat tolerance, trimmed
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 large avocado, halved, peeled, and pit discarded
* ⅓ cup loosely packed cilantro
* 1 lime, juiced
* 4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature
* Salt

**Beer-battered cod:**

* 1½ pounds cod, patted dry and cut into 1-inch cubes
* 1½ cups flour
* 1 tablespoon chili powder
* 2 teaspoons salt, plus more as needed
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon cayenne powder
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder
* 16- ounce can of Corona or your favorite lager or pilsner
* Veggie or peanut oil, for frying (you’ll need a couple cups!)

**For serving:**

* 3–4 radishes, trimmed and thinly sliced
* 1 small cucumber, sliced into rounds
* ¼ red onion, minced
* ⅓ cup loosely packed cilantro, minced
* Small flour or corn tortillas; I recommend 2–3 per person
* Sliced serrano or jalapeño, thinly sliced
* 1 lime, cut into wedges

**Prepare the slaw:**

1. Place the cabbage, red onion, serrano pepper, and cilantro in a large bowl. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pour the lime juice on top.
2. In a microwave-safe bowl, add the vinegar and sugar. Microwave for 1 minute until the sugar is dissolved. Let stand for 5–10 minutes.
3. Add the mayonnaise and whisk until completely smooth.
4. Pour the dressing over the cabbage and toss to combine. Taste and season to your preferences. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.

**Prepare the jalapeño-avocado cream cheese:**

1. Turn on your oven’s broiler to high.
2. Place the red onion and jalapeños in a small oven-proof skillet or baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil. Transfer to the oven under the broiler. Broil for 3–5 minutes (depending on the intensity of your broiler) until the peppers begin to blister and blacken. Remove and set aside.
3. Combine the avocado, cilantro, lime juice, charred jalapeño, and red onion in a food processor. Place the cream cheese on top and pulse until completely smooth and creamy. Taste and season with salt. Pour into an airtight jar or a bowl and cover tightly with foil. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.

**Make the cod:**

1. Pour oil into a large pot, about 3 inches deep, and heat the oil to 350º–375ºF. Note: If you don’t have a deep fat thermometer, use an instant-read meat thermometer, provided the stem is long enough! You’ll want to regularly check the oil’s temperature and ensure you stay at a consistent 350ºF–375ºF.
2. Pat the cod pieces dry and season lightly with salt. Set aside.
3. Combine the flour, chili powder, salt, baking powder, paprika, cayenne powder, and garlic powder in a bowl.
4. Pour in the beer and whisk until completely smooth and free of lumps. The batter will be thicker than cream but still a tad runny.
5. Place all of the cod pieces in the batter and toss to combine.
6. Using tongs, lift a piece of cod from the batter and lightly shake off any drippy excess batter. Slowly drop it into the hot oil. Fry 4–6 pieces at a time, depending on the width of your pot. Be sure not to overcrowd the pot! Cook for 3–4 minutes until golden brown all over. Use a slotted spoon to transfer a paper towel-lined plate. Continue frying in batches, checking and adjusting the temperature periodically.

**To serve:**

1. Arrange radishes, cucumber, red onion, cilantro, sliced jalapeño, and lime wedges on a serving platter.
2. To assemble the tacos, smear a spoonful of the jalapeño-avocado cream cheese onto a warm tortilla. Place a few cod nuggets on top and finish with a spoonful of slaw. Sprinkle minced red onion and cilantro on top. Add one or two slices of jalapeño on top for extra heat, if you like. Serve cucumber, lime wedges, and radishes on the side. Enjoy!

**Notes:**

For the recipe, you’ll use cilantro in the slaw, cream cheese, and for serving. Buy just 1 nice-sized bunch and divide it into 3 for each component.

You’ll also need to buy just 1 red onion (use half of it for the slaw, and the remaining half is used for the cream cheese and for serving).

111e92a,Beetroot Cured Salmon,1025,10,"Originally posted here: [**Beetroot Cured Salmon** ](https://www.insightflavour.com/post/beetroot-cured-salmon-recipe)

**Ingredients for Cured Salmon:**

* 1kg (2.2pounds) side of salmon (trimmed and skin off)
* 200g (7oz) of beetroot (peeled and diced)
* 120g (4.2oz) of cooking salt
* 70g (2.4oz) of sugar
* 40ml (3tbsp) of vodka or gin
* 2tsp of coriander seeds
* 2tsp of peppercorns
* 1tsp of juniper berries

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for the Fennel Slaw:**

* 4 fennel bulbs (thinly sliced with a knife or mandolin)
* 2 small red onion (thinly sliced)
* 1 medium carrot (cut julienne or grated)
* 150g (2.6oz) of mayonnaise
* 4tsp of mustard (Dijon or English)
* 2 lemon zest
* 2 lemon juice

&amp;#x200B;

F**or Garnish:**

* small bunch of fresh dill
* 1tsp of nigella seeds

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Beetroot Cured Salmon:**

**1.** To prepare the beetroot cure, blend beetroot, sugar, salt, vodka, and spices in a food processor for about 15 seconds.

**2.** Next, find a container large enough to fit the salmon and line it with a double layer of cling film wrap. Transfer half of the beetroot cure to the centre of the film and spread it to match the size of the salmon. Place the salmon on top and cover it with the remaining cure mixture, making sure to spread it over the top and all sides of the fish.

**3.** Tightly wrap the salmon in the cling film and place a weight on top of the fillet. Refrigerate for 48 hours. (While pressing the salmon is not necessary, it can increase the contact between the fillet and the cure).

**4.** After two days, remove the salmon from the container, unwrap it over the sink, wash off all the beetroot cure, and pat dry. Re-wrap the salmon in fresh cling film and store it in the refrigerator for up to one week, or vacuum pack it and store it for up to three weeks. (Once cured, handle the salmon gently as it becomes more fragile. For the cleanest cuts, use a very sharp knife when slicing.)

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Fennel Slaw:**

**1.** In a mixing bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, mustard, the juice of one lemon, and lemon zest to make the dressing.

**2.** In another bowl, mix together sliced fennel, sliced onion, and grated carrot to form the slaw.

**3.** Just before serving, combine the dressing with the slaw mixture. Toss until the slaw is evenly coated with the dressing.",1676308092000,0.9799804688,Seafood,mienczaczek,https://i.redd.it/g5oupq70nzha1.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/111e92a/beetroot_cured_salmon/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/111e92a/beetroot_cured_salmon/,Beetroot & blackberry cured salmon,396.0,3.8,25.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,34.0,1.0,

103an4j,Sesame Salmon Sushi Bowls,1581,34,"# Sesame Salmon Sushi Bowls

These are poke bowl style, but use seasoned sushi rice as the base. If you would rather make this as a poke bowl, skip the sushi rice section and just use plain white rice. You can easily customize these with whatever extra toppings you like.

**Original Recipe**: [https://craftycookbook.com/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls/](https://craftycookbook.com/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls/)

**Time:** 50 mins

**Servings:** 2 XL bowls (as pictured) or 3-4 smaller servings

**Ingredients**

*For Sushi Rice:*

* 1 1/2 cups medium grain sushi rice
* 1 3/4 cups warm water
* 6 tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar *(This should have no calories. If it has calories, the vinegar is already seasoned with sugar and salt.)*
* 2 tbsp white sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp table salt

*For Sesame Salmon:*

* 6-10 oz sushi quality salmon (pictured is 5 oz per bowl)\*\*
* 2 green onions
* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp toasted white sesame seeds

*To Finish Bowls:*

* 1/2 medium-sized ripe avocado, optional
* \~1/2 cup shelled, frozen edamame, optional
* \~1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion, optional
* \~1/4 cup daikon sprouts, optional
* other veggies such as carrots, cucumber, nori, bean sprouts, etc optional

\*\*I purchase fish marked for sushi/sashimi from a Japanese grocery store, but this isn't the only option available.

**To Prepare Sushi Rice:**

1. The rice takes about 50 minutes to prepare, but has a lot of hands-off time. The salmon and veggies for this meal can be prepared as the rice cooks. Optionally, you can substitute plain white rice to make this recipe as a poke bowl instead.
2. Place the rice in a large pot (that has a lid). Rinse and drain the rice until the water runs clear, at least 3 times (rinse the rice even if the bag says it's ""prewashed""). Drain as much water as possible.
3. Add 1 3/4 cup lukewarm water to the pot, close with the lid, and place on the stove top.
4. Heat over medium-high heat until the water begins to boil, once boiling cook over medium-high heat for 4 minutes, then reduce heat to very-low and simmer for 15 minutes.
5. After simmering, remove from heat and let the pot stand undisturbed for another 15 minutes.
6. Scoop the rice into a large non-metallic bowl. Dust with sugar and salt, then pour over the rice vinegar. Using a rice spatula or non-stick spatula mix everything together and break up all the clumps of rice. Mix until every grain of rice is separated and coated in vinegar, the sugar and salt should dissolve completely. Don't worry if the rice seems too wet at this point, that will go away as it cools.
7. Allow the rice to cool uncovered, mixing occasionally, until it reaches room temp (about 15 minutes). You can speed this process along by fanning the rice if desired. The rice should be slightly sticky once it's cooled.

**To Prepare Veggies:**

1. Boil the edamame per package instructions (typically 3-4 minutes), then drain and season lightly with salt.
2. Peel the red onion and cut it in half, then slice as thin as possible until you have about 1/4 of a cup.
3. Clip daikon sprouts from their base and thoroughly rinse.
4. Prepare the avocado last, as it will brown if exposed to air for too long. Peel and thinly slice the 1/2 avocado as desired.

**To Prepare Sesame Salmon:**

1. Rinse the salmon thoroughly, then pat dry with paper towels. Using a very sharp chef's knife, slice the salmon into strips. Once in strips, slice again into cubes. You do not need a sushi knife, a sharp chef's knife will do. I make my cubes about 1/2 inch in size, but choose any size you prefer.
2. Remove the root tip of the green onions and discard, then slice as thinly as possible (green and white portions). After slicing, use your hands to separate the rings of the white portion as much as possible.
3. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the cubed salmon, green onion, sesame oil, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Mix until fully combined. *If not using immediately, cover and return to the fridge until ready to use.*

**To Finish Bowls:**

1. Divide the sushi rice evenly into the serving dishes, creating a wide, flat base.
2. Spoon the salmon into the serving bowls, discarding any sauce that remains in the mixing bowl. 
3. Top with veggies as desired, then serve immediately with a spoon and chopsticks.

If you like this recipe I would really appreciate a visit to my independent website [Leviathan Food](https://www.leviathanfood.com/), where there are plenty more that I developed.

**INGREDIENTS**

* 12 scallops
* 300ml sunflower oil
* 15g fresh ginger
* 2 heaped tbsp. gochugaru
* 1 - 2 heaped tbsp. chilli flakes
* 2 large scallions
* 4 garlic cloves
* 1 1/2 tsp. white sugar
* 2 tbsp. black sesame seeds
* 1 lemon
* 3 star anise
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 2 tbsp. tamari
* 1 tbsp. rice wine vinegar

**METHOD**

1.) Finely chop the scallions, garlic and ginger. Add half the sunflower oil to a pot on a medium heat. When it has come up to temperature add the scallions and cook for about three minutes. The oil will bubble as the water cooks out of them. Make sure they do not brown. Add the ginger, star anise and cinnamon and cook for another two minutes, stirring every so often, before adding the garlic and continuing to cook.

2.) In a bowl combine the gochugaru, sugar, black sesame seeds and chilli flakes. one tbsp. of chilli will give you a milder rāyu. If you like more of a kick you can add an extra spoonful. Add the mixture in the the pot and top off with the remainder of the oil. Stir well, and cook over a low to medium heat on a gentle and constant simmer for 12 - 15 minutes, taking care not to allow anything to burn or brown too much.

3.) Add the tamari and the rice wine vinegar and stir. Turn the heat off and allow to cook before placing in a sterilised jar. This should keep in the fridge for a few weeks.

4.) Remove scallops from the fridge to come to room temperature. Add oil and butter to a pan on a high heat. Pat them dry and season with coarse salt and pepper before placing in the pan flat side down. Push them down slightly and cook for about two minutes until a deep golden colour. Turn and cook or another minute or two. Baste with the butter. They should be springy to the touch and just warm in the centre when tested with a metal skewer.

5.) Add a tbsp. of the chilli oil to a plate and arrange three scallops around it. Spoon some of the chunkier pieces of the rāyu over the top and season. A squeeze of lemon juice and some grated zest elevates the dish.",1649100460000,0.9199218750000001,Seafood,leviathanfood,https://i.redd.it/1z7czhr22kr81.jpg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tw96z7/seared_scallops_with_black_sesame_rāyu/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/tw96z7/seared_scallops_with_black_sesame_rāyu/,Seared scallops with flavoured greens,146.0,1.33,8.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,18.0,2.0,0.86

## Prepare the Cilantro-Lime Dressing:

* In a food processor, combine all the ingredients for the cilantro-lime dressing and pulse until well-combine. If the dressing seems too thick, add a bit more oil or lime juice. Season with salt to taste. Set aside.

## Marinate the Shrimp:

* Transfer the shrimp to a bowl or Ziplock bag and pour half the cilantro-lime dressing on them and toss to combine. Transfer to the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes.

## Prepare the Tomato-Cucumber Salad:

* In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, cilantro, minced jalapeño, diced cucumber, lime juice, and radishes and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

## Dress the Greens:

* Transfer the greens to a large bowl and drizzle with the extra virgin olive oil. Add a sprinkle of salt and a touch of black pepper and use your hands to dress the greens with the oil. Divide the greens between plates and set aside.

## Cook the Cilantro-Lime Shrimp:

* Heat the neutral cooking oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the shrimp in an even layer, cooking in batches if necessary, and pour 1-2 tablespoons of the marinade from the bag over the shrimp. Cook for 1-2 minutes and then flip the shrimp and cook for 2-3 minutes more or until the shrimp are opaque and cooked through. Turn off the heat.

## To Serve the Cilantro-Lime Shrimp Salad:

* Pile the tomato-cucumber garnish on top of the salad greens and arrange the cooked shrimp on top. Drizzle with the remaining cilantro-lime dressing.

n5svwf,Easy Clam Chowder,3414,97,"I LOVE clam chowder, it’s frequently my order if it’s on the menu, and back in the day I used to crack open the canned stuff for a quick dinner. Once I started making lots of homemade soups I found that I couldn’t go back to canned soup anymore, which was a bummer because I also didn’t want to go through the hassle of getting and handling fresh clams to make clam chowder myself. 

This recipe uses canned clams and it’s the perfect middle ground in my opinion! Canned clams are an excellent source of iron, and they are cheap and last for a long time in the pantry! 

# Ingredients

* 2  6.5 oz cans of clams
* 1  8 oz bottle of clam stock (clam juice) \*see note
* 2 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled and cut into \~1 cm cubes \*see note
* 4 strips of thick cut bacon (or 6 regular strips)
* 1 large white onion, diced
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 2 cups whole milk (can sub non-dairy)
* ¼ cup all-purpose flour
* ⅔ cup corn (from one cobb, or sub canned)
* 1 tbsp fresh thyme
* ½ cup shredded carrots (optional)
* 1 bay leaf (optional)
* Salt &amp; fresh cracked black pepper

# Instructions

1. Strain the clams over a measuring cup, reserving the liquid (should get about 1 cup total). Combined with the 8 oz bottle there will be 2 cups of clam stock, set this aside.
2. Heat a large, wide pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Cut the bacon into bite-sized pieces and cook it until it reaches your desired level of doneness (I like to let some get crispy and pull some off a little sooner). Remove to a paper towel lined plate and leave the drippings in the pot. 
3. Add the onions to the pot and cook in the bacon drippings until they soften, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Add some extra olive oil if the bacon drippings don’t coat the bottom of the pot)
4. Add the potatoes, garlic, 1 tsp salt, and ¼ tsp pepper to the pot. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently.
5. Dust the flour evenly over the contents of the pot and cook, stirring frequently, for another \~3 minutes.
6. Add the milk and clam stock and stir until well-mixed. Add the bay leaf, thyme, carrots, and corn. Bring to a boil over high heat, and then reduce heat to medium-low to simmer until the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes (stirring occasionally to prevent potatoes from sticking to the pan's bottom). Add more salt and pepper to taste.
7. Add the clams and bacon bits to the soup 2-3 minutes before serving. Remove the bay leaf and serve the soup topped with more thyme and fresh cracked black pepper.

# Notes

* Serve in bread bowls or alongside crusty bread for dipping.
* Dicing the potatoes into small (\~1 cm) chunks is critical to the texture of the soup, the outsides of the pieces dissolve and contribute to the creaminess of the soup. If cut too large this won't be as effective.
* Clam stock (clam juice) can usually be found near the canned clams at the grocery store in 8 oz glass bottles.

### Notes

If you like a spicier Gumbo replace smoked sausage with andouille sausage, making it 4 Links of Andouille and add another TBSP of Creole Seasoning.

I like to peel about 70% of the shrimp before I put in, this way most won't need peeling while you're eating but you still get the flavor from the shrimp shell from the remaining 30%.

The stock is flexible, you can use all Seafood, or all Chicken - I just like the blend of both.

jppcnx,The perfect recipe for tender and delicious fried calamari!,1143,45,"While this may seem like a simple recipe, you'd be surprised how easy it is to overcook fried calamari. Most people don't know the secret as to how to tenderize the calamari the night before cooking so that it comes out perfect and with even more flavor.

**Ingredients**

* The desired amount of calamari, cleaned and cut (I usually make about 1 kg each time, it goes quick!)
* About 10-15 lemons
* 4 cups of frying flour
* Deep frying oil
* 2 tbsp corn starch (optional)
* 1 cup of milk/buttermilk
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp Red pepper flakes (optional)
* Fresh chopped parsley

**Directions**

1. Put all of your cleaned calamari into a large bowl. Squeeze about 5-10 lemons (depending on their size) into the bowl of calamari. Cover with plastic and leave in the fridge overnight.
2. The following day, take the calamari and rinse off any excess lemon juice. Then, replace the calamari in the same bowl and pour milk/buttermilk until they are fully submerged. Cover with plastic and leave in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
3. While waiting, take a bowl and mix your flour with your seasonings. If you like a bit of a kick, use some red pepper flakes. Add corn starch for that extra crispiness.
4. Take your calamari from the fridge and *individually* dredge each piece in your flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Set them aside for frying.
5. Preheat your frying oil to 375 degrees F, either in a pot or deep fryer no more than half full.
6. Fry your calamari for no more than 2-2 1/2 minutes until golden brown. Drain excess oil using paper towels

15budzd,Vegetable Balti,157,6,"In this recipe, I will introduce a technique commonly used in restaurants for preparing curry. To start, we will prepare a curry base gravy, which serves as the foundation for many Indian curries. This versatile and flavourful sauce will be the key ingredient in our Vegetable Balti. Additionally, you can utilize this base gravy in  other curry dishes as well.

**Portions:** 4-6 servings

**Preparation time:** 30 minutes

**Base Gravy cooking time:** 40 minutes

**Vegetable Balti cooking time:** 35 minutes

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for Curry Base Gravy:**

\* 4tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil

\* 2tbsp cumin seeds (use ground if not available)

\* 1tbsp coriander seeds (use ground if not available)

\* 1tbsp ground turmeric

\* 1/2tsp red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)

\* 1tbsp garam masala

\* 1tbsp paprika

\* 2 large onions diced

\* 1 medium carrot diced

\* 4tsp garlic ginger paste

\* 400g of chopped tomatoes

\* 700ml of vegetable stock (plus more if needed)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for Vegetable Balti:**

\* 2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil

\* 2 medium-size onions, cut into four then broken apart

\* 1 green pepper, cut into 8

\* 1 red pepper, cut into 8

\* 2 medium-size tomatoes cut into wedges

\* a handful of white cabbage cut into squares

\* 10 Okra fingers, tops removed and cut in half

\* two handfuls of frozen peas

\* 2 large potatoes, peeled and diced

\* half of small cauliflower, cut into florets

\* 1tbsp ginger garlic paste

\* 2-3 ladles of base curry gravy

\* 2tbsp of yoghurt

\* knob of butter (skip if using ghee)

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions for Curry Base Gravy:**

**1.** In a large saucepan or pot, heat the ghee or vegetable oil over medium heat.

**2.** Add the cumin seeds and coriander seeds to the hot oil. If you have ground cumin, you can add it later along with the other spices. Sauté the cumin and coriander seeds for a minute or until they start releasing their aroma.

**3.** Add the diced onions and carrots to the pan. Cook and stir them for about 5-6 minutes or until the onions become soft and translucent.

**4.** Now, add the garlic ginger paste to the pan. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously, until the raw smell of garlic and ginger disappears.

**5.** Mix in the turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and paprika (if using ground cumin, add it now). Stir everything together to coat the vegetables with the spices evenly.

**6.** Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes or until the tomatoes become soft and start breaking down.

**7.** Pour in the vegetable stock, and give the mixture a good stir. Bring it to a gentle boil.

**8.** Lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pan, and let the curry base gravy cook for about 20-25 minutes. The vegetables should become tender, and the flavours will meld together.

**9.** Once the vegetables are fully cooked, turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down slightly.

**10.** Using a blender or an immersion blender, blend the mixture until you achieve a smooth and thick curry base gravy. If the consistency is too thick for your liking, you can add more vegetable stock to reach the desired thickness.

**11.** Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt or spices if needed.

Your curry base gravy is now ready to use! You can use it immediately in your favourite curry dishes or store it for later use. This flavourful base will enhance the taste of your curries, whether you're preparing vegetarian, chicken, lamb, or any other type of curry.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Vegetable Balti:**

**1.** Heat the ghee or vegetable oil in a Balti pan or a large wok over medium heat. Add the broken apart onions to the pan and stir-fry for a few minutes until they start to soften.

**2.** Toss in the potatoes, green and red peppers, and continue stir-frying for a couple of minutes.

**3.** Add the tomato wedges to the pan and sauté briefly until they start to break down and release their juices.

**4.** Incorporate the white cabbage, okra, frozen peas and cauliflower florets into the pan. Stir everything together to mix the vegetables evenly.

**5.** Add the ginger garlic paste and continue to stir-fry for a minute or two, ensuring the vegetables are coated with the paste.

**6.** Pour in the base curry gravy. Start with 2 ladles and adjust the quantity based on how saucy you want the Balti to be.

**7.** Stir everything together and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the vegetables cook in the gravy for about 15-20 minutes or until they are fully cooked but still retain their texture.

**8.** Check the seasoning and add salt or additional spices if needed.

**9.** Stir in the yogurt and mix it well with the vegetables and gravy. This will add a creamy richness to the dish.

**10.** If you're using vegetable oil, add a knob of butter at this stage to enhance the flavours of the Vegetable Balti.

**11.** Once the vegetables are cooked to your liking and the flavours have melded together, turn off the heat. Your Vegetable Balti is now ready to be served! Transfer it to a serving dish, and you can garnish it with chopped fresh coriander leaves if desired. Enjoy this flavourful and aromatic dish with naan, rice, or any bread of your choice. Enjoy!

10r3nlp,Crispy Orange Tofu,421,17,"# Crispy Orange Tofu

Time: 35 mins

Serves: 4

Original Recipe: [https://www.craftycookbook.com/crispy-orange-tofu/](https://www.craftycookbook.com/crispy-orange-tofu/) 

A generous coating of corn starch helps get this tofu incredibly crispy. Make sure to press the tofu to remove excess water for best results. 

**Ingredients**

* 1 block extra firm tofu, 14 – 16 oz, pressed to remove excess water
* 10-12 oz broccoli florets, \~4 cups
* 3 green onions, greens sliced thin, or topping
* ¼ cup corn starch
* roasted sesame seeds, optional, for topping
* crushed red pepper flakes, optional, for topping
* veggie oil

*For Sauce:*

* 2 navel oranges -  zest one orange, juice both oranges, or sub ⅔ cup orange juice
* 3 tbsp honey, sub date syrup for vegan
* ¼ cup soy sauce
* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic
* ½ tbsp ginger paste or freshly grated ginger, or sub ½ tsp ground ginger
* 2 tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar
* 2 tbsp corn starch
* sriracha sauce, optional, (for mild – ½ tbsp ; medium – 1 tbsp ; hot – 1.5+ tbsp)

**Instructions**

1. Cut the tofu into \~¾” cubes. In a large bowl, toss the cubes in the ¼ cup of corn starch until they have an even, thick coating.
2. Combine the soy sauce and 2 tbsp corn starch in a small saucepan and whisk until fully combined. Then add the rest of the sauce ingredients and mix well. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-low heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer until a thick sauce forms, about 5 minutes. Remove the completed sauce from heat. If you accidentally over-reduce the sauce, just add a splash of water and mix.
3. As the sauce cooks, warm a generous swirl of veggie oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the tofu pieces and cook, turning occasionally, until they are golden and crispy on most sides, about 10 minutes. Remove to a large bowl.
4. Add a little more oil to the pan if needed, and add the broccoli florets. Cook until they brighten in color and just begin to char, about 2 minutes.
5. Pour the orange sauce over the tofu and toss to fully combine, then add the broccoli and toss further.
6. Serve over a bed of rice (I use jasmine rice). Top with green onions and sesame seeds. Add crushed red pepper flakes for extra spice.

**Notes**

* Pressing the tofu to remove excess water is very beneficial to the final texture, I strongly recommend pressing your tofu for at least 30 minutes before preparing the recipe. If you don’t own a tofu press, wrap the block in paper towels, set it on a rimmed plate or tray, and place a heavy object on top of it.

zc7qy7,Paneer Korma,179,12,"Check out my recipe for a delicious go-to Korma sauce recipe that you can use as a base for many Korma dishes. In this instance, I prepared a vegetarian version with roasted paneer cheese and vegetables. This sauce also works great with Chicken, Lamb and Beef. You can also use it as a dipping sauce for Naan bread or for other vegetarian alternatives like chickpeas or lentils. I hope you find this recipe useful, enjoy cooking!

This recipe makes 4 portions.

**Ingredients:**

\* 200g of paneer cheese, cut into cubes

\* 2 medium onions, small dice

\* 1 medium carrot, fine dice

\* 4 garlic cloves, sliced

\* 4tbsp of veg oil or ghee

\* 500ml of veg stock

\* 1 can of coconut milk or coconut cream

\* 2 peppers, large dice

\* 1 red onion, cut into wedges

\* fresh coriander for garnish

\* salt

**Korma Spice Blend:**

\* 1tbsp of ground cumin

\* 2tbsp of ground coriander

\* 2,5tbsp of ground turmeric

\* 1tbsp of garam masala

**Garam Masala for Korma:**

To make the most delicious curry you can prepare your own Garam Masala. The secret is to ground the spices fresh, for this purpose, you can use an inexpensive electric grinder to do so. Below you can find a list of basic ingredients that make the most aromatic Garam Masala, if you don't want to go that far with your cooking you can purchase a ready-made blend.

\* 3cm of cinnamon

\* 1 star anise

\* 1tsp of black peppercorns

\* 1/2tsp of cloves

\* 10 green cardamom pods

**Instructions:**

1. Set frying pan on medium heat, add 2tbsp of vegetable oil followed by diced onions, garlic and carrots, and cook until soft and glossy (10-15min) stirring occasionally.
2. Add good pinch of salt and 3tbsp of  Korma spice blend, incorporate and cook on low for another minute or so to bloom the spices.
3. Transfer everything from a frying pan to a medium-sized pot and add 500ml of vegetable stock. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer, place a cover on the pot and cook for around 10 minutes.
4. In the meantime roast red onions, peppers and paneer cheese. To do so marinate them in 2 tbsp of vegetable oil, a little salt and 1tbsp Korma spice blend. Roast at 220C for around 15 minutes. To save energy I recommend using an air fryer instead of the oven.
5. Now add coconut milk or cream to the pot and blend the sauce using an immersion blender. Once smooth, check the seasoning and add more salt if necessary, if you like your Korma more on the sweet side add honey instead.
6. You can combine sauce with roasted vegetables and paneer cheese or serve them as garnish. Serve with rice or naan bread, and add fresh coriander. Enjoy!

Makes: 10 spring rolls

Time: \~45 mins

Nutrition: \~100 Cal for 1 roll + 1/10 of sauce

Original recipe:  [https://craftycookbook.com/crispy-veggie-spring-rolls-with-peanut-sauce/](https://craftycookbook.com/crispy-veggie-spring-rolls-with-peanut-sauce/)

**Ingredients**

* 10 rice paper sheets, 22 cm, round
* 1 large shallot, or sub a small onion
* 2 cups coleslaw mix (shredded cabbage &amp; carrots)\*\*
* 2 cups broccoli slaw mix (julienne broccoli stems &amp; carrots)\*\*
* ½ tbsp freshly minced garlic
* 1 ½ tbsp soy sauce
* neutral oil (canola oil, veggie oil, etc)

\*\* You can use any crunchy veggies you want, some other options are lettuce, bean sprouts, and bok choy. The preshreded mixes make this recipe easier, but you can save money but shredding the veggies yourself!

*For Sauce:*

* 2 tbsp peanut butter
* 1 ½ tbsp soy sauce
* ½ tbsp toasted sesame oil
* 1 tbsp packed light brown sugar, optional
* ½ tbsp Sriracha, add more to taste as desired
* ½ tbsp lime juice
* 1 tsp freshly minced garlic
* ½ tsp grated ginger, or sub ¼ tsp powdered ginger
* ½ tbsp cornstarch

**Instructions**

1. Peel the shallot and thinly slice it across the short end, creating rings. Separate the rings with your hands.
2. Warm 1 tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the shallots and cook, stirring frequently, for two minutes. Add the garlic, coleslaw mix, and broccoli slaw mix and cook, stirring frequently, for another minute, then add the soy sauce and cook for one more minute. Remove mixture from heat and transfer to a plate or bowl to cool. (You can jump ahead and prep the sauce for step 4 as the mixture cools, but don’t start the heat)
3. Once the mixture has cooled, make each spring roll one at a time. Prepare a wide bowl of water, large enough to dip the rice paper. Briefly dip the rice paper, turning it so every part touches the water. Place the rice paper on a clean, smooth surface and fill with ¼ cup of filling. Roll the spring roll (if you're unfamiliar with this technique, see the video on the website or google how to roll a spring roll). *\[The rice paper softens more overtime. If it feels rigid, wait a minute and try again. Try to make the rolls as tight and cylindrical as possible, wide/flat rolls don’t fry as nicely.\]*
4. Once the rolls are prepped, prepare the sauce. Combine the cornstarch with ¼ cup warm water and mix until dissolved. Combine this and all the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan and place over low heat as you pan fry the spring rolls, mixing occasionally. If needed, add a splash of water to the sauce to maintain a silky consistency as it simmers.
5. Warm 2 tbsp of oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Once hot, add 5 spring rolls (make sure they don’t touch, they will stick together). Pan fry the rolls, turning occasionally, until the outside is crispy, about 3 minutes. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate and repeat with the next 5 rolls, adding a little more oil if needed. Serve immediately with peanut sauce on the side.

y35grf,Crispy Gnocchi in Pumpkin Sauce,3251,75,"# Crispy Gnocchi in Pumpkin Sauce

Time: 25 mins

Makes: 4 servings (pictured is 2 servings, 1/2 batch)

Original recipe: [https://craftycookbook.com/crispy-gnocchi-in-pumpkin-sauce/](https://craftycookbook.com/crispy-gnocchi-in-pumpkin-sauce/) 

**Ingredients**

* 7.5 oz pumpkin purée, half of a standard 15 oz can
* 1 lb gnocchi, from 1 standard package
* ¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for topping
* 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, optional, for topping
* ¼ cup half-and-half
* 1 cup chicken or veggie stock
* 3 tbsp salted butter
* 1 tbsp light brown sugar
* 1 tbsp cornstarch
* ½ tbsp freshly minced garlic
* ⅛ tsp ground thyme optional
* ⅛ tsp ground nutmeg
* ¼ tsp salt

**Instructions** 

1. Dissolve the cornstarch in the chicken/veggie stock. Make sure your parmesan is grated and ready to go.
2. Melt 2 tbsp of butter in a medium skillet over medium to medium-low heat. Add the gnocchi, breaking up any that are stuck together. Toss until all the pieces are lightly coated in butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the gnocchi is golden and crispy on the outside, and soft in the center, about 10 minutes. (Note, you start with gnocchi straight out of the package, don't boil them first!)
3. Meanwhile, melt 1 tbsp of butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Once melted, stir frequently until the butter browns and gives off a nutty smell, about 1 to 3 minutes depending on the temp of your stove. Once the butter is lightly browned, add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 more minute.
4. Quickly add the pumpkin to the skillet and mix to incorporate it into the butter and garlic mixture. Add the stock/cornstarch mixture and half-and-half, and bring the skillet to a simmer.
5. Allow the pumpkin mixture to cook down, stirring occasionally, until the consistency is similar to the photos, about 7 minutes. Meanwhile, add the brown sugar, ground thyme, salt, and ground nutmeg. Remove from heat and mix in the grated parm, stir until it is fully melted and incorporated.
6. Plate the pumpkin sauce directly onto the serving dish, then top with crispy gnocchi. Add a little fresh thyme and grated parm if desired, and serve immediately.

w4ik9j,Easy Quinoa-Corn Chowder,1874,54,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Vegan Quinoa-Corn Chowder Recipe**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/vegan-quinoa-corn-chowder/)

This is for an upcoming project for 5-ingredient vegan meals thus the sparse ingredients! 5 ingredients do not include water, cooking oil, salt, or pepper.

It was still super tasty and is a great recipe to build upon. You could easily add garlic, roasted poblano peppers, or extra plant or meat protein to the soup.

For extra plant protein, I would add white beans or tofu crumbles or top with fried tofu chorizo crumbles.

If you want to do meat, I would do something light like shrimp or chicken.

You can also get creative with toppings like what I suggested below or add some crispy tortillas, crushed crackers, finely chopped tomatoes, or minced red onion.

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced
* 1 cup quinoa, rinsed
* 5–6 cups of water or vegetable stock
* 2 ears of sweet corn, husked and cut from the cob
* 1 cup loosely packed cilantro, minced
* 6 ounces plant-based cream or coconut milk
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Sliced jalapeño
* Lime
* Cilantro

**Method:**

Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook in the oil for 6–7 minutes, turning occasionally, until they just begin to soften.

Add the quinoa to the potatoes and cook for 1 minute.

Pour in 5 cups of water or vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Once boiling, reduce heat to a hard simmer and cook for 20 minutes or until the quinoa is tender. If the soup is too thick, add the remaining 1 cup water or stock.

Add the corn, cilantro, and cream to the soup and simmer for an additional 5–6 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Ladle the chowder into bowls. Garnish with jalapeño slices, a lime wedge, and a few more cilantro leaves if you like.

\* 1 medium potato, cut into fine matchsticks

\* 1tbsp of garlic and ginger paste

\* a handful of chopped fresh coriander

\* 1tsp of salt

\* 1tsp of mild chilli powder

\* 1tsp of ground coriander

\* 1tsp of turmeric

\* 1tsp of ground cumin

\* 1 large egg (you can skip for the vegan version, reduce the flour by 50g)

\* 150g (5.3oz) of gram flour (made of chickpeas)

\* 1L of vegetable oil for deep-fat frying

**Ingredients for chilli sauce:**

\* 1 red chilli, seeds removed and sliced

\* 1 red bell pepper, diced

\* 1 garlic clove

\* juice of a half lemon

\* 50ml of water

\* 1/4tsp of salt

\* 1/4tsp of sugar

\* 1/4tsp of ground cumin

**Instructions for Bhajis:**

1. Preheat a deep fat fryer or a small pot with oil to 170C (340F) (you can check pot oil temperature with an electric probe)
2. Mix sliced onions with potato matchsticks, green chilli, garlic ginger paste, fresh coriander, salt and spices. Do so until all onions are coated with colours.
3. Mix in one egg to coat the onions then add chickpea flour, combine until no signs of dry flour is left.
4. Use gloves for protection, take a small amount of Bhaji mix and shape in your hands into a ball (do not compress the mix) put it gently into the hot oil. Cook Bhajis until golden-brown then flip upside down for another minute or so to colour the topside. I recommend using a spider strainer or tongs to remove Bhajis from the oil. Place them onto a kitchen paper to drain excess fat.
5. Do it in a few batches until all Bhajis are done, serve straight away or reheat in the oven later before serving.

**Instructions for Chilli sauce:**

1. Place all the ingredients in the bullet like this one and blend into a smooth chilli sauce.
2. Transfer into a bowl to allow air bubbles to escape, then transfer into a serving dish.

Smacznego!

- 3 medium potatoes

- 200g cooked chickpeas

- 150g butter

- 500 ml vegetable broth

**Preparation:**

1. Prepare your veggies: finely dice the onion and chilli. Mince the garlic. Cut the apple and potatoes into cubes, 2 by 2 cm should be ideal. I actually like to peel the potatoes but leave the skin on the apples.

2. Begin by heating the butter in a pot over medium heat. Once it’s melted, add the onion and immediately salt it so it releases some moisture. Sweat for 4 minutes, then add your chilli and garlic. Cook for 2 minutes, then add the curry powder and cook for another 2 minutes.

3. Add the apples and broth. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. 

4. Remove half of what’s in the pot, blend it and return to the pot.

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 15 minutes

Inactive Time:: 1 hour

Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes

Servings: 6

Calories: 425kcal

## Equipment

* Large pot
* Sieve or colander
* Skillet

## Ingredients

* 1 pound small dry white beans, soaked according to package instructions; or use 2 15-ounce cans navy beans and drain and rinse them first
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 2 shallots peeled and diced, or use any onion variety
* 3 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and diced
* 2 tablespoons butter plant-based or dairy, optional
* 12 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and thinly sliced
* 2 teaspoons silk chili flakes (or use 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper/cayenne powder plus a little paprika)
* 1/2 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1/2 teaspoon dry parsley
* 6 cups water or vegetable stock plus more if needed
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Mushroom topping (optional):

* 2 tablespoons butter plant-based or dairy
* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 4 ounces mushrooms of your choice such as beech, cremini, or shiitake
* 1 ounce pine nuts, almonds, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, or your favorite nut/seed of choice
* Salt to taste

## For serving:

* Fresh parsley minced

## Instructions

## Soak the beans (optional):

* If using dry beans, soak them according to package instructions in a large pot. Small beans may only need an hour or two of soaking time. Drain them and set them aside. Return the pot to the stovetop and wipe it out.

## Cook the aromatics:

* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in the large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the shallots and celery and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 6-7 minutes. Season lightly with salt.

## Cook the mushrooms:

* Melt the butter into the shallot and celery. Once frothy, add the mushrooms. Cook for 8-10 minutes until the mushrooms release all their liquid and begin to brown and crisp up around the edges. Season with salt.

## Cook the beans:

* Add the silk chili, thyme, and parsley and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the soaked beans and toss to coat.

## Simmer the beans:

* Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for at least 30 minutes or until the beans are tender. Small beans, like the Alubia Blanca, take around 1 hour to become tender. If using canned beans, simmer for only 30 minutes. Add more stock or water as necessary if the broth evaporates too quickly—taste and season with salt and pepper.

## Cook the topping:

* Once the beans are ready to be served, prepare the topping. Heat the oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat until melted and frothy. Add the mushrooms and cook for 3 minutes until they begin to brown. Add the pine nuts and cook for an additional 2 minutes until browned. Be careful not to burn the pine nuts! Turn off the heat and season lightly with flaky sea salt.

## To serve:

* Ladle the cooked beans into bowls and garnish with minced parsley. Scatter the warm mushroom and pine nuts on top. Enjoy!

p9aojf,Polish Wild Mushroom Soup,2026,35,"The best time of the year is just around the corner and the first fruit of the fungi can be found almost everywhere. The high humidity and cold temperatures of this season work in favour of mycelium, bringing us a vast variety of delicious mushrooms. On my short staycation in Lake District, I found a few beautiful Porcini mushrooms that you can see in the picture as well as multiple Larch Boletes referred to in my country as butter mushrooms. They have slimy caps and are perfect for sauces, soups or pickles. As the name suggests Larch Bolete can be found growing in symbiosis with Larch trees starting in July till November.  
  
This is my family recipe for a delicious and filling mushroom soup, perfect after a fungi hunt. It contains pasta and a variety of vegetables that elevate the mushroom flavour. The recipe works with Boletus mushrooms but if not available you can prepare them with chestnut mushrooms instead.  
  
In Poland, mushroom picking is very popular among families and the knowledge is passed from generation to generation. Make sure to always pick mushrooms with someone who knows what they doing, or pick specimens that are hard to confuse, I always recommend signing up for a foraging experience! It is great fun and you can learn something new! :)  
  
This recipe makes 4 portions  
  
  
  
**Ingredients:**  
  
\- 400g (14.1oz) of sliced Boletus mushrooms (or chestnut mushrooms)  
  
\- 1 medium-size onion, diced  
  
\- 4 garlic cloves, sliced  
  
\- 2 medium carrots, small dice  
  
\- half celery stick, small dice  
  
\- 3-inch piece of leek, small dice  
  
\- 1 large potato small dice  
  
\- 1tbsp olive oil  
  
\- 1tsp of butter  
  
\- 1,5L of vegetable stock  
  
\- 150g (5.3oz) of penne pasta  
  
\- 100ml of double cream  
  
\- 1 bay leaf  
  
\- black pepper  
  
\- parsley to garnish  
  
\- 1tsp of yoghurt per plate mixed in before serving (optional)  
  
  
  
**Instructions:**  
  
1.In a frying pan, preheat 1tbsp of olive oil. Add diced onion and 4 sliced garlic cloves, cook on medium heat for 5 minutes or until softened. Add sliced mushrooms with 1tsp of butter and turn up the heat to medium-high, cook for another 5 minutes. Once mushrooms are done remove from the heat and set aside ready for later.  
  
2.In a large pot add 1,5L of vegetable stock, carrots, celery, leek, potato and bay leaf. Bring to the boil and reduce to simmer. Cook for 10 minutes.  
  
3.Next, add 150g of penne pasta and cook for another 10 minutes.  
  
4.Add fried mushrooms, onions and garlic. Continue cooking for another 5 minutes.  
  
5.At this point, pasta should be cooked through and mushrooms should hold the shape, if the soup seems too thick add a little bit more water.  
  
6.Take one ladle of soup with no solids out of the pot and mix it with 100ml of double cream. Pour the mixture back to the pot. (This prevents the cream from splitting)  
  
7.Check the seasoning and serve garnished with freshly cracked black pepper and chopped parsley. You can mix in 1tsp of yoghurt just before serving to increase the sourness to your liking. Enjoy!

\- 1 tsp celery seed  
\- 1 tsp salt

\- ¼ teaspoon sugar  
\- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper  
\- 1 leek thinly sliced  
\- 1 pound Asparagus trimmed of tough ends  
\- 2 tablespoons olive oil  
\- 1 cup frozen peas  
\- Salt and pepper to taste  
**Instructions**  
1. Prep the pie crust at least 30 minutes in advance. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, celery seed, and salt. Add cold butter, and using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut the butter into the flour until there are only small, peas sizes pieces of butter visible in the flour. Next add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing with your hand or a spatula after each addition, until the dough begins to stick together. Using your hands, form the dough into a flat disk. Cover with plastic wrap, and chill at least 30 minutes.  
2. Preheat oven to 400°F. Toss asparagus with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper. Roast until slightly fork tender, about 10-15 minutes. Once the asparagus is out of the oven, raise the temp to 425°F.  
3. Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat in a medium skillet. Add leeks and a pinch of salt, and sauté until softened and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add frozen peas, and sauté until thawed completely, another 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.  
4. On a floured surface, roll out the dough until it's large enough to line a 9 inch round pie pan. Line pie pan with pie dough, prick bottom with a fork several times, then crumble half of the goat cheese and spread along bottom. Next add leeks and peas and spread evenly throughout the dish. Then crumble the rest of the goat cheese. Lastly arrange asparagus on top of the fillings.  
5. Add eggs to a mixing bowl, and beat slightly. Then add heavy cream, 1 teaspoon salt, sugar, and cayenne and whisk to combine. Pour egg mixture evenly over other ingredients in the pie dish.  
6. Bake at 425°F for 15 minutes. Then lower the temperature to 300°F and bake 35-40 minutes, or until set with just a slight wobble in the middle.

For the full recipe with step by step pictures: [http://meza-blog.com/recipe/beetroot-risotto/](http://meza-blog.com/recipe/beetroot-risotto/)

**INGREDIENTS**

**Risotto:**

 

* 2 medium beetroots
* 170 gr rice, arborio or carnarroli
* 140 ml water
* 1 onion
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 dl white wine
* 0.5 liter vegetable stock, (more if needed)
* 1 tablespoon butter, preferably room temp
* 20 gr grated parmesan cheese

**garnish:**

* 50 gr fresh goat cheese
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* pinch of salt
* 1/2 teaspoon orange zest

**METHOD:**

 

1)Start by making the puree for your risotto. Simply place your beetroots in a baking tray, cover with aluminum foil and place inside a pre heated oven on 180\*C.

2)Bake the beetroots until fork tender (piercing a fork inside without applying any pressure). Time may vary from 45 minutes to 2 hours.

3)Once fork tender, peel the skin off, dice the beets roughly and blend with a stix mixer.  
your beatiful beetroot puree is now ready to use!

For the garnish:

1)Place your cheese, olive oil and salt into a shallow mixing bowl and blend well with a stix mixer.

2)Pass the creamy mixture through a fine sieve to assure a more stable texture.

3)Mix well with the orange zest and set aside for further use.

For the risotto:

1)Start by preparing the rice. Take a skillet or shallow pot and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your rice.

2)Stir constantly for about 2-3 minutes until the edges of the grain start becoming translucent.

3)Now that we build a protective layer around the grain, pour in your water and stir frequently until all the water has evaporated.

4)Transfer the rice onto a tin, and let cool.

5)Once cool, your rice is ready to use. This is a neat little step worth making when cooking risotto as it helps release more of that starchy goodness later on when cooking the risotto. Par-cooked rice like this can last up to a week in a food container in your fridge and will greatly shorten your time preparing risotto.

6)Now take your skillet and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle over a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your diced onions.

7)Saute the onions until soft and translucent. It will probably take in between 7-10 minutes.

8)Once your onions are beautifully tender, add in your finely minced garlic and stir for another minute.

9)Now add in your rice and season with salt and pepper. (This is the perfect time to add salt as it will drain any extra juices which will be absorbed by the rice.)

10)Stir constantly for another minute or two and proceed to pour in your wine.

11)Keep stirring (from this moment on, you’ll have to be stirring most of the time as more motion the rice makes, the more starch it releases, creating a creamy texture.) until all the wine has evaporated.

12)Now that your wine has evaporated, add 3 tablespoons of your beetroot pure and stir until incorporated.  


13)Now start adding your vegetable stock (hot! so it doesn’t prevent the rice from continuing to cook.) a little at a time as the rice absorbs the liquid. The reason you don’t pour it all at the same time is because you don’t know how much liquid the rice will absorb.  


14)When the rice is cooked al-dente  it should still have a slightly “runny to watery” texture, we don’t want it thick.

15)Now turn off the heat and add the butter, preferably room temperature so it blends more quickly

16)Once you add the butter, now is the time to really work your hand, and give the rice a good beating, stirring it vigorously until all the butter has blended with the dish.  


17)After the butter has blended add the parmesan cheese and beat again, this time not as vigorously until the cheese has melted.",1610287492000,0.9799804688,Fruit\Vegetarian,Zamezi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kuezx3,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kuezx3/beetroot_risotto_with_creamy_goat_cheese/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kuezx3/beetroot_risotto_with_creamy_goat_cheese/,Beetroot risotto with feta,727.0,1.9,24.0,19.0,9.0,93.0,22.0,8.0,0.96

jzevyd,Sweet and tangy pineapple and cucumber pickle,1372,33,"This is an old favourite. My mom use to make this, it’s called Acar Timun dan Nenas 🇲🇾. Some variations include carrot, and others use more vinegar and sugar but I find this ratio of vinegar to sugar the best since it doesn’t result in an overly watery Acar (pronounced Achar like Charmander). It’s fantastic on a very warm day. 

**Ingredients** (can be amended to suit your tastes)

* One cucumber. Roughly peel the cucumber so you get that lovely variation in green colour. Score lengthways with a fork. Slice lengthways once through the middle and then chop thinly. 
Realistically you can cut them up however you like but a thin slice is best imo.

* Half a small pineapple, chopped. 

* Half a red onion (or one shallot), sliced as thinly as possible. 

* One red chilli, thinly sliced. Or more if you like spicy stuff.

* Two tablespoons of white vinegar 

* Two teaspoons of white sugar 

* Half a teaspoon of salt 

**Directions**

Chop up ingredients. Mix in bowl thoroughly (very thoroughly) with vinegar, sugar and salt. Don’t add any water, there will be quite a bit of liquid from the pineapple and cucumber. Put in fridge for a bit, 30 mins or so. Eat.

Someone asked what this normally goes with. It’s usually a side to some white rice and spicy curry. The heat from the curry goes really well with the coolness of the pineapple and cucumber.

2 Gala apples

4 clovesgarlic

8 sliceswhole grain bread

1 mediumyellow onion

 black pepper

 tbsp butter, unsalted

 tsp oregano

 salt

&amp;#x200B;

Directions:

1. Wash and dry the fresh produce.

2. Quarter the apples lengthwise, then cut out the core and stem from each section. Cut 2 of the quarters lengthwise into thin wedges and transfer to a small bowl. Medium dice the other 2 quarters and transfer to a medium bowl.

3. Trim off and discard the ends of the onion and remove the outer layer; small dice the onion (cut into ¼-inch pieces) and add to the bowl with the apples.

4. Preheat a medium saucepan over medium heat.

5. Trim off and discard the root ends of the garlic; peel and mince or press the garlic. Add to the bowl with the apples and onion.

6. Once the saucepan is hot, add butter and swirl to coat the bottom. 

2 tbsp butter, unsalted

7. Add the apples, onion, and garlic to the saucepan; season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the apples and onion are softened, 4 to 6 minutes.

1 tsp dried oregano

½ tsp salt

¼ tsp black pepper

8. Coarsely grate 2 cups of cheddar.

9. Add the diced tomatoes and broth to the saucepan; season with additional salt and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 8 to 10 minutes.

½ tsp salt

¼ tsp black pepper

10. Add butter to a nonstick skillet and heat over medium-low heat.

1 tbsp butter, unsalted

11. Place the bread slices on a clean, dry work surface. Divide the apple slices and cheese between 4 of the bread slices, then top with the remaining bread slices.

12. Once melted, spread the butter around the skillet, then season the bottom of the skillet with salt.

¼ tsp salt

13. Place the sandwiches in the skillet and cook until golden brown and crispy on the first side, 3 to 4 minutes. Then, add more butter and salt, and carefully flip the sandwiches; cook until golden brown on the other side and the cheese has melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Once done, transfer to a cutting board. Cook in batches if necessary.

1 tbsp butter, unsalted

¼ tsp salt

14. Using a hand blender, purée the soup until smooth. Alternatively, use a potato masher to mash the tomatoes and apples (the soup will be chunkier).

15. Cut the grilled cheese sandwiches in half diagonally.

16. To serve, divide the soup between small bowls and serve with the grilled cheese on the side.

How to Vegetarian Pumpkin Meatballs :

Ingredients

* 500 gr pumpkin
* 100 gr parmigiano
* 100 gr breadcrumbs
* 1 egg
* 60 gr assorted cheese
* 3 sage leaf
* salt &amp; Black pepper

**INSTRUCTION**

* Cut the mozzarella in slices of 1 cm thickness. Arrange them gradually on a tray lined with absorbent paper and cover with other sheets of paper towels.
* Cut 500 gr pumpkin in slices, remove the peel and put on a oven tray
* Season with olive oil and salt
* cook for 30 minutes at 140°
* mash the cooked pumpkin in a mixing bowl with a fork
* Add 100 gr parmigiano and 100 gr breadcrumbs
* add 1 egg, salt, pepper and 3 sage leaf finely cut
* make a ball with the dough and put in the fridge for 30 minutes
* Cut the mozzarella and the other cheese in small dices. This time i made these pumpkin meatball in three variations, mozzarella, cheddar or fontina cheese. For all the meatballs you will need a total of 60 gr of cheese
* take the dough in the fridge and form balls of about 40 gr inserting in the center some cubes of the chosen cheese.
* Close the meatball as to seal the cheese inside and work with your hands to give it a round shape.
* Don't make the meatball too big or the cheese inside will not melt from these doses you should get about 15 meatballs
* put every meatball in the breadcrumbs
* At this point, bring frying oil to a temperature of 140° and immerse the meatballs in oil for a couple of minutes, so that the cheese inside melts
* When they are golden brown, drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil

That's all! Like i said this recipe is very easy and remember : Eat while it's still hot!

## Equipment

* Large pot
* Small pot

## Ingredients

## Tomato Risotto

* 1 pound ripe tomatoes, halved or chopped cherry, heirloom, or vine
* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced
* 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil divided
* 1 lemon juiced and zested; zest reserved for garnish
* Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste
* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 2 cups arborio rice
* 6 cups vegetable stock
* 1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese plus more, for serving
* Salt and pepper to taste

## For Serving:

* Grated parmesan cheese
* 8 cherry tomatoes halved
* Flaky sea salt
* Extra virgin olive oil

## Instructions

## Marinate the Tomatoes:

* In a bowl, combine the tomatoes, minced garlic, 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Set aside for 15 minutes.

## Start Risotto:

* Heat the stock in a small pot on the stove until warm. Keep the heat on low.

## Sauté the Onion:

* In a large pot, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring often, for 5-7 minutes until it begins to soften and turn golden brown.

## Cook the Tomatoes:

* Add the marinated tomatoes and cook for 8-10 minutes until they just begin to soften.

## Cook the Rice:

* Melt 2 tablespoons of butter into the tomatoes and add the rice. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring gently occasionally.

## Incorporate the Stock:

* With the heat on medium, spoon 1-2 ladles of stock into the rice. Stir gently until the liquid is absorbed. Repeat, adding 1-2 ladles of stock and stirring gently until the stock is absorbed. Continue on until the rice is al dente. You may not use all 6 cups of stock.

## Finish the Risotto:

* Once the rice is tender, turn off the heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Add the grated parmesan cheese and stir to incorporate. Allow the risotto to rest for 5 minutes before serving.

## To Serve:

* In a small bowl, combine the reserved halved cherry tomatoes, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper and toss to combine.
* Divide the cooked risotto between shallow bowls. Garnish with the halved cherry tomatoes and more parmesan cheese, if desired. Sprinkle with lemon zest. Enjoy!
