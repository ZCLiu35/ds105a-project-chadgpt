I use Frank's, but you can use your favorite cayenne-based hot sauce, or like my dad...you can make a little wing sauce concoction of all your favorite random hot sauces in your fridge.

**Ingredients:**

* 1¼  pounds chicken tenderloins
* ½ cup flour
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons Frank’s RedHot Original Hot Sauce, or use your favorite cayenne-based hot sauce
* 2 cups panko
* 4 scallions, trimmed and minced
* Neutral oil, for frying
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the chicken:**

1. Pat the chicken tenderloins dry and season with salt and pepper.

**Set up your dredging station:**

1. Set out three shallow dishes. To the first dish, add flour, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and a pinch of salt. To the second dish, add 2 eggs plus 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and whisk until smooth. Add panko with a pinch of salt and pepper to the third dish.

**Preheat the oil:**

1. Add about ¼ inch of neutral oil to a wide pot or skillet. You only need enough oil to come up to half the thickness of a chicken tender. Turn the heat to medium-low to preheat the oil.

**Dredge the chicken:**

1. Dip a chicken tenderloin into the flour and shake off the excess. Next, dip it into the egg mixture and shake off the excess. Finish dredging the chicken by rolling it gently in the panko; gently press it into the tender to ensure it adheres. Transfer to a baking rack. Continue until all tenders are dredged.

**Heat the sauce:**

1. Simmer the remaining 1 cup of hot sauce over low heat as you fry the chicken tenders.

**Fry the chicken tenders:**

1. Turn the heat on the oil to medium. If you drop a piece of panko into the pot, it should bubble and sizzle but not overly vigorously. You can use a meat thermometer to ensure it is 350ºF.
2. Once the oil is hot, fry the chicken tenders in batches, about 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown. Once the tenders reach 165ºF, transfer them to a cooling rack or paper towel-lined plate.

**Sauce the tenders:**

1. Once all the chicken tenders are fried, pour the warm sauce into a large bowl.
2. Add the chicken tenders to the bowl in batches and toss gently to coat in the sauce.

**To serve:**

1. Transfer the sauced tenders to a serving platter and sprinkle with minced scallions.

* .5 ounces dry porcini mushrooms
* 1 cup boiling water
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 leek, white and light green part only; trimmed, scrubbed thoroughly, and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 1 cup arborio rice
* 5–6 cups warm water or vegetable stock, more or less as needed
* 4 ounces Taleggio cheese, rind removed
* ½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
* 2 tablespoons finely minced parsley
* 1 lemon, juiced
* Sweet pea tendrils, optional, for serving
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the porcini mushrooms:**

1. Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl. Pour 1 cup boiling water over the mushrooms and soak for 20 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the water and finely chop them. Reserve the soaking liquid for the risotto.

**Fry the cremini mushrooms:**

1. Place a large pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium. Add the sliced cremini mushrooms to the dry pot and cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes. The mushrooms will release water and begin to dry out.
2. Once all the liquid evaporates from the pot, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 8–10 minutes more, turning regularly, until browned and crisp. Season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the leek:**

1. Add the leek and chopped porcini mushrooms to the pot. Cook, turning occasionally, for 5 minutes until the leek softens.

**Toast the rice:**

1. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot. Add the rice and cook for 2–3 minutes until it begins to toast. Season with salt and pepper.

**Begin adding liquid:**

1. Add the porcini soaking liquid and stir to incorporate and lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring periodically until the rice absorbs all the liquid.
2. Add warm water or vegetable stock in ladleful increments, stirring after each addition and adding more liquid once the rice absorbs what’s in the pot. Stir occasionally, but not constantly. You may need to adjust the heat between medium and medium-low to prevent the risotto from sticking.
3. After 20–25 minutes, the rice should be tender and the liquid creamy. You may need 4–5 cups of liquid, give or take. Taste and add more salt and pepper.

**Finish the risotto:**

1. Turn the heat to low. Add the Taleggio cheese and stir to incorporate. Continue stirring until the cheese melts completely. Add the Parmesan cheese, minced parsley, and lemon juice. Simmer for 2–3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Taste and season, and let the risotto stand for 5 minutes.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the risotto into a large serving bowl. Garnish with sweet pea tendrils and a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese if you like.

* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper

**Prepare the broth:**

**Shred the chicken:**

1. Turn the heat off. Using tongs, carefully transfer the chicken into a large bowl. Pick the meat from the bones once the chicken is cool enough to handle. You can add the skin to the soup if you like or discard it. Reserve the carcass for stock if you like.
2. Strain the broth into a large bowl through a fine mesh sieve. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop. Discard the spent broth aromatics.

**Make the soup:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook for 8–10 minutes. Season with salt. Add the garlic and scallion whites and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
2. Add the ginger and turmeric and toss to coat. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the lentils and cook for 1 minute. Add a big pinch of salt.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Pour in the reserved broth–you should have about 8–10 cups. Add the shredded chicken and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes until the lentils are tender. Taste and add crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper to taste. Stir in half the minced scallion greens and the lemon juice. Simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.

5. Heat a skillet well over a heat just below high. Add vegetable oil. Place the meat and do not stir until it has set. After that you can stir. Cook for 5-7 minutes.
6. For the dressing, mix together: scallion, chili pepper, garlic, sesame seeds, sesame oil and paprika. Pour in the boiling vegetable oil. Then add soy sauce, rice vinegar, salt and sugar.
7. Cook the glass noodles according to the recipe on the package. In my case, pour boiling water over it and leave it for 5-7 minutes. Afterward, drain the water.
8. Transfer the glass noodles to a salad bowl. If desired, cut with scissors. Add the roasted carrots and bell pepper, cucumber, beef and pour the dressing over them. Mix well.

This salad took me about 25 minutes to make. It's best to eat it right away because it tastes better when it's warm. It will keep in the refrigerator for about 2-3 days.",160,0.9501953125,Recipe,Yummyronica,1700482264000,https://i.redd.it/k2cymncfuh1c1.png,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/17zn5bx/warm_thai_glass_noodle_beef_salad/,Warm Thai chicken & noodle salad,336.0,1.7,10.0,0.0,1.0,40.0,24.0,2.0,0.98

* 6 cups water or chicken stock
* 1 pound butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into bite-sized cubes
* 1 cup dry orzo
* Salt and pepper
* Sour cream, optional, for serving

**Cook the chicken:**

1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 8–12 minutes, breaking it up as it cooks until completely cooked through.
2. Add the chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne powder, and white parts of the scallions. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the soup:**

Add the green chilies and salsa verde. Pour in the water and add the butternut squash. Add a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 30 minutes until the squash is tender.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Taste the soup and add more salt and pepper if needed. Use the back of your spoon to mash up some of the squash to make a thicker broth.
2. Return to a boil and add the orzo. Cook for 10–12 minutes until the orzo is tender. Stir regularly to prevent the orzo from sticking. See note.
3. Turn the heat to low. Add half the minced scallion greens. Simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and season once more. Turn off the heat.

If you don’t have time to make chicken broth, simply shred up a rotisserie chicken and use 32 ounces of store-bought chicken broth!

**Chicken broth:**

* 3–4 pound whole chicken, neck and giblets reserved for another use
* 10–12 cups water
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt

**Soup:**

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 small carrots, peeled and diced
* 4 ribs celery, trimmed and diced

* Salt and pepper

**Make the broth:**

1. Place the chicken in a large pot and cover with water. Add the salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour.
2. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl. Turn the heat on the broth to medium and low boil for 20 minutes or until the liquid reduces to about 8 cups. Strain the broth through a sieve into a large bowl. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.
3. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bird and shred or dice it into bite-sized pieces. Reserve the skin for another use (like snacking on it or frying it up for a crispy garnish) and reserve the carcass for stock if you like.

**Start the soup:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook for 8–10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Add the garlic powder, thyme, and crushed red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the ditalini and cook for 1-2 minutes under al dente. Drain.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Taste the soup once more. Stir in the cooked ditalini, heavy cream, and baby spinach. Simmer for 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and season a final time. Turn off the heat. Note: You can also serve and store ditalini separately from the soup if you're averse to pasta swelling the next day.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with freshly grated Parmesan and a few basil leaves. Finish with freshly cracked black pepper, if you like.

**Short ribs:**

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 pounds boneless beef short ribs
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 cups low-sodium beef stock
* 3 cups Cabernet Sauvignon or similar full-bodied red wine
* 10 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly crushed
* 2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Parmesan mashed potatoes:**

* 4 large Yukon gold potatoes, about 1½ pounds
* 2 tablespoons butter
* ⅓ cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
* ⅓ cup heavy cream or whole milk
* 2 tablespoons chives, minced
* Salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika to taste

**Prepare the short ribs:**

1. Pat the beef dry and season with salt and pepper.
2. In a large, wide pot, heat the oil over medium-high until hot. Add the short ribs in an even layer and cook without moving for 3 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 2-3 minutes per side until browned all over. Remove from the pot. Turn the heat to medium.
3. Add the garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and, using the back of your spoon, gently press the paste into any browned bits left in the bottom of the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes until the paste deepens in color.
4. Pour in the red wine and lift up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the beef stock. Bring to a boil. Add the beef short ribs back to the pot and reduce heat to a low simmer. Simmer, covered, for 3 hours. Taste and season.
5. Remove and discard the garlic cloves. Skim off as much fat from the top as you can. If you can refrigerate the short ribs overnight, you can remove the fat the next day before proceeding with the recipe. If you don't want to wait, just skim off what you can while it's still warm and proceed with the recipe as-is.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Remove the ribs from the broth and bring the broth to a rapid simmer over medium-low. Cook for 25 minutes until the broth reduces by half and thickens. Mount the cold butter into the sauce, whisking to incorporate until glossy. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
2. Using your fork, tear the ribs into large pieces. Add them back to the sauce and toss to coat.

**Prepare the mashed potatoes:**

1. Peel and quarter the potatoes. Cover with salted water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 20-25 minutes until fork-tender.
2. Drain the potatoes and return them to the warm pot. Allow any residual water to evaporate for 5 minutes. You can turn the heat to low to speed up this process.
3. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl with the butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and heavy cream. Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes until they reach your desired consistency. Add the chives, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and paprika, and mash to incorporate. If the potatoes seem dry, add a few more splashes of heavy cream.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the potatoes between plates. Add a few pieces of the beef on top and drizzle the sauce all over.

Here's my recipe! I've been eating so much chicken and rice...this variation was SO good!

**Broth:**

* 2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 8 cups water, plus more if needed
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and quartered
* Salt

**Soup:**

* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 3 ribs celery, trimmed and diced
* 4 carrots, peeled and sliced into rounds
* 2 teaspoons dry thyme
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more if desired
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 cup dry white wine or water
* 1 cup jasmine rice, rinsed well
* 1 lemon, juiced
* 4 ounces baby spinach, chopped
* Salt and pepper

**Make the broth:**

1. Place the chicken in a large pot and cover with water. Add the onion and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Remove foam and scum as it floats to the top of the broth while the chicken cooks.
2. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl. Return the broth to a low boil over medium heat. Simmer for 10–15 minutes or until the broth reduces and darkens a bit in color. You should be left with about 5–6 cups of broth.
3. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the spent onion. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.

**Prepare the chicken:**

1. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, carefully pick the meat from the bones and shred it with two forks or your fingers.
2. Discard the bones and skin. You can also dice the cooked skin and air-fry or pan-fry it to make a crunchy garnish for the soup if you like.

**Cook the mushrooms:**

1. Turn the heat on the pot to medium. Add the mushrooms and cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes. The mushrooms will release water, and that water will evaporate.
2. Once the water evaporates and the mushrooms begin to “squeak” in the pot, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and cook for 2 minutes until golden brown. Season with a pinch of salt.

**Sauté the aromatics:**

1. Add the onion, celery, and carrots to the mushrooms and cook for 5–7 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, thyme, paprika, and crushed red pepper to taste. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Deglaze the pot with 1 cup of white wine or water. Stir well to lift up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes.
2. Pour in the prepared broth and bring to a boil. Stir in the chicken. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the rice:**

1. Return the soup to a boil. Stir in the rice and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes or until the rice is tender. Add another cup or two of water if the rice absorbs too much liquid. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Add the lemon juice and spinach. Simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

Serves: 4

Cook time: 1 hour

**Ingredients**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 medium onion peeled and diced
* 2 small leeks white and light green parts only, scrubbed and thinly sliced
* 4 ribs celery trimmed and finely diced
* 1 fennel bulb cored and thinly sliced, fronds reserved
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 5 cups water or low-sodium vegetable stock
* 1 pound potatoes scrubbed and peeled (or leave skins on, if you prefer), cut into 1″ cubes
* 1/4 cup heavy cream optional
* ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped sage
* Salt and pepper

**Cook the aromatics:**

1. Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften about 6–7 minutes.
2. Add the celery and fennel and cook for an additional 5 minutes—season with salt and pepper.

**Bloom the spices:**

1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the thyme, paprika, and garlic powder—Cook for 45 seconds.

**Prepare the roux:**

1. Sprinkle the flour over the aromatics. Cook, stirring regularly, for 3–4 minutes.
2. Slowly whisk in the water or stock in 1-cup increments. Whisk after each addition until smooth. Turn the heat to medium-high. Continue adding the liquid and whisking until all the liquid has been incorporated. Taste and season generously with salt and pepper.

**Cook the potatoes:**

1. Once the liquid is bubbly and simmering rapidly, add the potatoes. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 30 minutes until the potatoes are fork-tender. Taste and adjust the seasonings once more.

**Prepare the sage oil:**

1. As the potatoes simmer, prepare the sage oil. Pour the extra virgin olive oil into a small saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Once the oil is hot, add the sage. The oil should bubble as soon as the sage is added. Next, turn the heat to low and allow the oil and sage to bubble lightly over low heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Be careful not to burn the sage!
2. Turn off the heat and add a sprinkle of salt. Set aside.

**To serve:**

1. Once the potatoes are fork-tender, turn off the heat. Spoon the soup into bowls and garnish with reserved fennel fronds. Drizzle the sage oil on top. Enjoy!

 * immersion blender    
 * wide mouth mason jar (with lid to store)  
 * small rubber spatula to stir  
   
Ingredients  
* 1 egg.  
* 1 cup oil (I use canola)  
* 1/2tsp-3/4tsp pink salt depending on preference (use 3/4tsp if using regular salt)  
* 1/2 tsp dry mustard  
* 2tsp lemon juice    
* 2TBSP white vinegar    

1.  Put all ingredients in a wide mouth mason jar (Check that your immersion blender fits, if not you may need a separate container.)  
  
2.  Put immersion blender at bottom of jar, turn on. 
  
3.  When you start seeing Mayo form at bottom of jar start rocking blender off the bottom a little at a time and slowly raise up as Mayo forms until the whole jar has emulsified.  Shouldn’t take more than 30 seconds total with a good immersion blender.  
  
4. Scrape extra Mayo out of immersion blender into the jar and stir to check for any small pockets of oil.  
  
5. Put the lid on and refrigerate until ready to use.  

  
I had to start making my own Mayo because of a soy allergy and I don’t miss store bought at all. The flavor and texture on this are way better than even the name brand Mayo I was using almost exclusively.  Keeps in the fridge at least 2 weeks, possibly longer but I’ve used it all up by then every time. Tastes best after resting an hour or 2 in the fridge as the salt dissolves and lemon juice and vinegar mellow out, but is still better than store bought when fresh made.",25,0.8701171875,Recipe,speshuledteacher,1693794259000,https://i.redd.it/zeyy7et855mb1.jpg,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/169ea7n/easy_homemade_mayonnaise/,Basic mayonnaise,267.0,0.17,29.0,0.2,4.0,0.2,1.0,0.0,0.76

* 1 tsp Baking Powder
* ½ tsp Ground Ginger
* ½ tsp Ground Cinnamon
* ¼ tsp Table Salt
* 50 g Sour Cream

**To Grease The Moulds**

* 10 g Unsalted Butter - Softened

**Method**

**Custard**

1. Place the milk, cream, half the sugar, vanilla pod &amp; salt into a medium sized saucepan. Set over a low heat &amp; warm until steaming (don't boil!).
2. In the meantime, add the egg yolks, remaining sugar, milk powder &amp; cornflour into a heatproof mixing bowl &amp; whisk to combine.
3. Pour a third of the warm milk into the yolks &amp; whisk them together.
4.  Pour the tempered yolks into the pan of remaining milk &amp; cook over a low heat until thickened &amp; has reached a temperature of 82°c. Make sure to stir the custard constantly with a rubber spatula to stop it from catching. 5. Pass the custard into a jug, through a sieve then serve immediately.

**Toffee Sauce**

1. Place the cream, sugar, butter &amp; golden syrup into a medium sized saucepan then place over a low heat.
2. Cook until the butter has melted &amp; the sugar has dissolved then increase the heat &amp; bring to the boil. Cook for 2-3 minutes then remove from the heat &amp; stir in the vanilla &amp; salt. Set aside &amp; leave to cool. 2. Next, grease the pudding moulds with softened butter then add a tablespoon of toffee sauce into the bottom of each one. Set aside in the fridge until ready to use.

**The Sponge**

1. Preheat an oven to 170°c/150°c fan (340°f/300°f fan).
2. Chop the dates into small pieces &amp; place into a bowl with the bicarbonate of soda &amp; boiling water. Leave to soak for 10-15 minutes then blitz with a stick blender/food processor until smooth.
3. In the meantime, sift together the flour, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon &amp; salt. Set aside.
4. Place the softened butter &amp; sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer then use the paddle attachment to beat until light &amp; fluffy. This will take at least 5 minutes on a medium speed.
5. Next, mix in the egg, followed by the black treacle.
6. Add in half of the flour &amp; half of the date puree &amp; mix until just combined.
7. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula then add in the remaining flour, dates &amp; the sour cream. Mix until just combined.
8. Transfer the cake batter into a large jug then pour an equal amount into each mould.
9. Place the moulds onto a baking tray then bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes. A skewer inserted into the centre should come out clean.
10. Once cooked, leave to cool for 5 minutes then use a sharp, serrated knife to trim each sponge level to the top of the mould.
11. Tip each sponge out onto a plate then pour over some hot toffee sauce.

**Preparation Time:** Approximately 30 minutes.

**Cooking Time:** 3-4 on high setting, 6-8 hours on the low setting (or overnight)

**Number of Portions:** 6-8

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for Slow Cooker Chilindrón:**

\* 500g (1.1 lbs) of chicken pieces (bone-in and skin on pieces like thighs or drumsticks)

\* 500g (1.1 lbs) of lamb or beef pieces (like shoulder chunks)

\* 200g (7 oz) chorizo sausage, sliced into rounds (iberico is the best)

\* 4 large red bell peppers, deseeded and sliced

\* 2 large green bell peppers, deseeded and sliced

\* 4 large onions, thinly sliced

\* 8 ripe medium tomatoes, chopped (800g)

\* 8 garlic cloves, minced

\* 240ml (1 cup) white wine

\* 4 bay leaves

\* 4 tbsp olive oil

\* 3tsp of salt

\* black pepper, generous amount

\* 4 tsp paprika

\* 200ml stock or broth (meat or vegetable)

\* Jar of Guindillas (pickled chilli)

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Slow Cooker Chilindrón:**

**1. Browning the Meat:** In a large skillet over high heat, add 2 tbsp of the olive oil. Once hot, add the chicken, lamb pieces, and chorizo slices. Brown them on all sides (you might need to do this in few batches). Transfer the browned meat to the slow cooker.

**2. Sautéing the Vegetables:** In the same skillet, add the remaining olive oil. Sauté the onions until translucent. Add the garlic and sauté for another minute. Transfer the onion and garlic mixture to the slow cooker.

**3. Slow Cooker Layering:** On top of the meat and onions in the slow cooker, add the sliced red and green bell peppers, chopped tomatoes, and bay leaves. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika.

**4. Deglazing the Skillet:** Pour the white wine into the skillet and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour this mixture into the slow cooker.

**5. Cooking:** Add stock, the vegetables will release moisture as they cook. Cover and cook on the low setting for 6-8 hours or high setting for 3-4 hours (or until the meats are tender and flavours melded).

**6. Final Adjustments:** Once done, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. If you desire a thicker sauce, you can thicken it with cornflour mixed with water.

1. Preheat oven to 425F. Roast potatoes in 1 tbsp butter and 1tbsp olive oil, ½ tsp salt, and 1 tsp thyme for about 25 minutes, stirring as needed. Reserve. Then roast the celery root in 1 tbsp olive oil, ½ tsp salt, and 1tsp thyme for 20-25 minutes. Add the roasted celery root to the reserved potatoes.

2. While the celery root is roasting, melt 2 tbsp butter in a large stock pot, then the chopped onion with ½ tsp salt. Sauté for 10 minutes, then add the chopped carrots and sauté 10 minutes more. 

3. Add the garlic cloves with the tomato and pepper paste, stir to fully incorporate and cook 2 minutes. Then mix in the reserved roasted vegetables with ½ tsp salt, ½ tsp pepper, 1 tbsp thyme, 2 tbsp vadouvan, and 1 tbsp butter. Toss in the bay leaf and pour in the corn and seafood stocks. Stir and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. 

4. Cover the pot and gently simmer for 45 minutes. Turn off the heat, **remove** and reserve the bay leaf. Blend the ingredients completely with an immersion blender. Taste. Return the bay leaf to the pot if desired, and heat the blended soup over low heat. When starting to simmer, add the corn, juice of ½ lemon, and ½ tsp salt to the pot, and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the heavy cream and ½ tsp black pepper.

Serves: 4

**Ingredients:**

* 1¾ pounds Yukon gold or russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
* 1 cup ricotta cheese
* ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving
* 2 tablespoons fresh chives or 1 tablespoon dry chives
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon white pepper
* 4 tablespoons butter, divided
* Splash of heavy cream or whole milk, if needed
* 2 ounces diced pancetta
* 1 medium shallot, peeled and sliced into rounds
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 pound pork tenderloin
* 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* ¾ cup chicken broth
* 8 ounces baby spinach
* ½ lemon, juiced (about 1½ tablespoons juice)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* Minced parsley, optional, for garnish

**Boil the potatoes:**

1. Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Add a liberal pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are fork-tender. Scoop out ½ cup of the cooking water and set it aside. Drain the potatoes.
2. Combine the ricotta, Parmesan cheese, chives, garlic powder, white pepper, and 2 tablespoons butter in a large bowl. Add ¼ cup of the potato cooking water and whisk until combined. The butter does not need to be completely melted. 
3. Add the cooked potatoes and use a masher to mash until mostly smooth. Taste and add salt and pepper. Add more of the potato cooking water or a splash of heavy cream as needed and continue mashing until the potatoes reach your desired consistency. Cover the bowl with foil and keep the potatoes warm.

**Cook the pancetta:**

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. Add the pancetta to a large, cold oven-proof wide pot and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook for 6–8 minutes, stirring frequently, until the pancetta is very crispy. Remove the pancetta from the pot using a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan.

**Caramelize the shallots:**

1. In the same pot over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once hot and shimmering, add the shallots, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes until the shallots begin to brown. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of sugar on top and continue cooking over low to medium-low heat (adjust the heat periodically as they cook) for 10 minutes more until evenly browned. Shallots burn very easily, so keep an eye on them!
2. Remove the shallots from the pot and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate. Season to taste with a sprinkle of salt. Carefully wipe out the skillet.

**Cook the pork tenderloin:**

1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the pot over medium-high. Once hot, add the pork tenderloin and cook for 3–4 minutes per side until the entire tenderloin is well-seared.
2. Transfer the pot to the oven and cook for an additional 15–18 minutes or until the pork reaches 135ºF at the thickest part. Remove the pot from the oven, transfer the tenderloin to a cutting board, and rest for 10 minutes. After the pork has rested, thinly slice and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.

**Make the spinach:**

1. Return the pot used for the pork tenderloin to the stove over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Once melted and bubbly, add the minced garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
2. Pour in the chicken broth and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Add the spinach and cook for 2–4 minutes, stirring regularly, until the spinach wilts. Add the lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and black pepper. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving platter and top with the spinach and a few spoonfuls of the pan sauce. Arrange the sliced pork tenderloin on top. Garnish with the crispy pancetta, browned shallots, and minced parsley. Spoon the remaining pan sauce on top of the pork.

•  1 whole Hokaido Pumpkin, skin on, seeds removed, and cubed (or a squash of your choice)

• 7 Diva apples, skin on, cored and cubed (or an apple variety of your choice)

• 3 Tbsp fresh sage, chopped (divided)

• 2 Tbsp Walnut Oil (divided)

• 2 tsp Sea Salt Flakes

• 1 tsp Fresh Ground Pepper

• 2 Tbsp Dark Maple Syrup (the darker the better)

• 2 Tbsp Brown Mustard

• 1/2 tsp Raw Apple Cider Vinegar

• Optional Garnishes: a sprinkle of Cinnamon or Sumac, Chopped Fresh Chives, Fresh Nasturtium Flowers

Method:

1. Preheat oven to 425 F
2. Prepare Squash: Toss cubed squash with 1 Tbsp Walnut Oil, 2 tsp salt, ground pepper, and half the chopped sage. Spread evenly on a baking sheet.
3. Place baking sheet in the oven and cook until squash begins to brown and becomes tender and delicious looking, about 20 minutes.
4. While the squash is cooking, toss the chopped apples in the remainder of the Walnut Oil and Sage (I add a dash of salt and pepper too).
5.  Add the diced apples onto the sheet pan, and stir to combine everything evenly. Place in oven for another 10 minutes.
6. During this cook time, immersion blend or stir together the Maple Syrup, Brown Mustard, and Apple Cider Vinegar. 
7. At this point the apples should still have some firmness, and the squash should be very tender. Take the Maple Syrup and Mustard mixture and drizzle it over the apples and squash. Place back in the oven and cook for 5 more minutes.
8. Remove from oven and plate! I garnished mine with some fresh Nasturtiums from the garden, but any fresh addition on top would be nice. Tarragon or Chives would be lovely! I've also garnished with sumac or cinnamon in other variations.

Cook Time: 40 minutes

Total Time: 50 minutes 

Servings: 4

Note: this is a vegan recipe so the ingredients use plant-based butter and parm. If you don't keep vegan, you can replace with dairy butter and cheese instead!

**Ingredients:**

* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 6 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
* ½ cup roasted red bell peppers, diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
* ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste
* 1 cup arborio, carnaroli, or any short-grain white rice
* ¼ cup vegan white wine, or use water and juice from 1 lemon
* 3 cups water or vegetable stock
* 15-ounce can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 3 tablespoons plant-based butter (or use dairy if you don't keep vegan)
* ½ cup freshly grated plant-based parmesan (or use dairy if you don't keep vegan)
* Salt and pepper

**Sauté the aromatics:**

1. Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion to the pot and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook, occasionally stirring, for 8-9 minutes until golden brown. Adjust heat as needed. Add the roasted red peppers, garlic, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Season all over with salt and pepper. Cook for 1 minute.

**Cook the rice:**

1. Add the rice to the pot and toss to coat. Season with salt. Cook for 1 minute until it begins to toast lightly.
2. Pour in the wine and bring it to a boil. Cook for 1–2 minutes.

**Simmer the rice:**

1. Add water or vegetable stock and chickpeas and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20–25 minutes. Turn the heat to medium and partially remove the lid (the pot should be half-covered). Rapid simmer for 5 minutes.

**Finish the rice:**

1. Turn the heat on the rice to medium-low and stir regularly. Continue simmering and stirring to cook off any excess liquid if needed. Stir in the plant-based butter and parmesan and simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring regularly, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Consistency should be creamy, not soupy! Add salt if needed.

**To serve:**

1. Sprinkle a few basil leaves on top of the pot and serve immediately.

2. Reduce heat to low and stir once. Crush the saffron between your fingers and sprinkle on top of the rice. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let stand for 10 minutes. Remove the cover and fluff with a fork.

**Make the salad dressing:**

1. Place the Greek yogurt, lemon juice, and parsley in a food processor. Pulse until smooth. Add the olive oil and blend until combined. Taste and add salt. Add a few splashes of water until the dressing reaches a drizzling consistency. Set aside.
2. Combine the Romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, shredded carrots, and avocado in a large bowl. Toss to combine. Pour the dressing on top and toss gently to coat evenly. Add salt and pepper, if needed.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the rice onto a serving platter. Pile the chicken thighs and vegetables on top. Garnish with minced parsley or mint leaves. Serve with Aleppo pepper, sumac, or dukkah on top if you like.

COOK TIME: 25 minutes

TOTAL TIME: 55 minutes

SERVINGS: 4

CALORIES: 285kcal

**Ingredients**

* 3 cups day-old rice; see note below
* 2 cups water
* .5 ounce dry shiitake mushrooms
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 8 ounces baby bella mushrooms trimmed, wiped clean, and thinly sliced
* 5 scallions minced; white and green parts separated; reserve a pinch of scallion greens for garnish
* 1 small yellow onion peeled and small-diced
* 1 green bell pepper trimmed, seeded, and small-diced
* 2 small carrots trimmed, peeled, and small-diced
* ¼ cup light soy sauce or use low-sodium soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 2 tablespoons mushroom soaking water
* 1 teaspoon minced ginger
* Pinch of white pepper, optional
* Pinch of crushed red pepper
* Salt to taste

**Prepare the mushrooms:**

1. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Turn off the heat and add the mushrooms. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and dice them.

**Prepare the vegetables:**

1. Dice all of the vegetables needed for the fried rice. Place the baby bella mushrooms in one bowl and combine the white parts of the scallions, the yellow onion, bell pepper, and carrots in a bowl.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Combine soy sauce, sesame oil, 2 tablespoons mushroom soaking water, minced ginger, white pepper, and crushed red pepper in a bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside.

**Make the fried rice:**

1. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sliced baby bella mushrooms and cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes until golden brown.
2. Add the bowl of diced vegetables (scallions, onion, pepper, and carrots) to the wok with the mushrooms and season lightly with salt. Cook, turning often, for 3–5 minutes until the carrots soften and the onions are translucent.
3. Add the diced shiitake mushrooms and cook for 1 minute.
4. Add the cooked rice to the wok and break it up with a metal spatula. Turn regularly, being careful not to mush up the rice too much. It should make good contact with the skillet or wok. Cook the rice for 5 minutes until it crisps up in spots.
5. Make a well in the middle of the rice. Pour in the sauce, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat back to medium. Use your spatula to toss the rice in the sauce for 1–3 minutes until well-coated. Stir in green scallion parts and cook for 1 minute. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the fried rice between shallow bowls and serve the remaining scallion greens on top. Enjoy!

**Recipe notes:**

\*If you don’t have day-old rice, make 3 cups cooked rice from 1 cup dry. Rinse 1 cup of dry rice and combine with 2 cups water and a few shakes of salt in a small pot. Bring to a boil, stir once, cover, and simmer on low heat for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let stand for 5–10 minutes. Transfer to a sheet pan or pour into a large bowl and spread into an even layer (up the sides of the bowl if not using a sheet pan). Transfer to freezer for 15 minutes.

**Ingredients**

* 5 ounces spinach, rinsed thoroughly
* 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped
* ½ cup loosely packed fresh basil, plus a few leaves for garnish
* ½ cup loosely packed fresh parsley
* ¼ cup shelled pistachios, unsalted
* 1 lemon, juiced
* ½ cup marscarpone or ricotta cheese
* ¾ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, divided
* 12 ounces tagliatelle
* 1 cup pasta cooking water
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Blanch the spinach:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add the spinach and boil it for 30 seconds. Transfer to an ice bath and set aside.

**Sauté the onions and garlic:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small pot over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10–12 minutes until very soft.
2. Add the roughly chopped garlic and cook for 1 minute. Season with a pinch of salt and turn off the heat. Set aside.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. To the pot of boiling, salted water, add the pasta and cook until al dente. Scoop out 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and set aside.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Drain the spinach and squeeze out as much of the excess water as possible. Place the basil, parsley, pistachios, spinach, and lemon juice in a food processor or blender. Pulse until finely minced. Add 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil and pulse again until incorporated.
2. Add the mascarpone, cooked onions and garlic, and ½ cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano to the food processor along with a big pinch of salt. Pulse until smooth. Add half of the pasta water and continue blending until smooth. Transfer the sauce to a bowl.
3. Sauce the pasta: Add the cooked pasta to the bowl of sauce. Toss to coat, adding more pasta cooking water as needed until the pasta is completely coated.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls. Garnish with the remaining grated parm and a few basil leaves. Finish each bowl with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil if you like.

**Ingredients:**

Crust:

* 4oz (120g) Digestive biscuits
* 4 tbsp (60g) of melted butter

Cheesecake:

* 5 sheets of gelatin
* 3 tbsp (50ml) of water
* 7tbsp (100ml) of lemon juice (2-3 lemons)
* 1/2 Cup (100g) of granulated sugar
* 12oz (350g) Philadelphia cream cheese (room temperature)

Decoration:

* 3 tbsp (45ml) lemon juice
* 2 tbsp (30ml) water
* 2 tbsp (25g) sugar
* Thinly sliced lemon

**Preparation:**

1. In a food processor, add 4oz (120g) digestive biscuits. Crush them until they are totally crushed, or no big chunks left (0,2 inches-0,5 cm). Add 4 tbsp (60g) of melted butter, and process until totally combined. You can also do this whole process by having the biscuits in a zip bag, and crushing them with a rolling pin, and then combining it with the melted butter in a small bowl with a spoon.
2. Add the mixture into a 8inch (20cm) spring pan or a removable bottom pan, and flatten it with a spoon or the bottom of a cup. Leave in the fridge for later.
3. In a small bowl with cold water, add 5 sheets of gelatin. Leave for later.
4. In a small sauce pan, add 3 tbsp (50ml) of water, 7tbsp (100ml) of lemon juice (2-3 lemons), and 1/2 Cup (100g) of granulated sugar. Turn it on to low-medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves. Once it starts boiling, add the 5 sheets of gelatin, turn off the heat, and stir for 1min before taking of heat, and leaving it to cool down for 5mins.
5. In a big bowl, add 12oz (350g) of Philadelphia cream cheese (room temperature), the zest of 2 lemons, and the lemon mixture from before, and whisk until combined.
6. In another big bowl, add 12oz (350ml) of heavy cream (35% fat, and better if it's chilled), and beat until medium-stiff peaks.
7. Add the Philadelphia mixture to the Heavy Cream mixture, and beat everything until combined. Then pour the mixture in the pan with the crust, flatten it out, and leave in fridge for at least 2 hours.
8. For the decoration, into a bowl with cold water, add 1 gelatin sheet. Leave it for later.
9. In a small sauce pan, add 3 tbsp (45ml) lemon juice, 2 tbsp (30ml) water, and 2 tbsp (25g) sugar. Turn it on to low-medium heat, and stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the gelatin sheet and stir for 1min. Then let the mixture cool down for 5min.
10. After those 5mins, you can add 1 or 2 drops of yellow coloring.
11. Pour the mixture into the Philadelphia pan. Pour it on top of the pan, on the back of table spoon, so it doesn't damage the surface of the cake. At this point you could also decorate with very thinly sliced lemon before putting it in the fridge for at least 2 hours.",185,0.9702148438,Dessert,OlegsKitchen,1693253788000,https://i.redd.it/zgq916p4iwkb1.jpg,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/163v5hv/nobake_lemon_cheesecake/,Lemon cheesecake (no-bake),470.0,0.5,37.0,22.0,23.0,31.0,4.0,1.0,0.94

**Ingredients:**

* Crust
* 5.5 oz (154g) Oreo cookies
* 1/4 cup (60g) melted butter Chocolate layer
* 5 oz (150g) dark chocolate
* 1/4 cup (60g) + 1 cup (240g) heavy milk (35% fat)
* 2.5 gelatin sheets
* Strawberry layer:
* 10.5 oz (300g) strawberries
* 1/4 cup (50g) sugar
* 1 + 1/4 cup (300g total) heavy milk (35% fat)
* 3 gelatin sheets 

**Recipe:** 

1. For the crust, add the oreos to a food processor and crush for around 1 minute. Add the melted butter and process until it's evenly wet. You can also crush the cookies by placing them in a zip bag and using something like a rolling pin to crush them, and then mix them with the melted butter in a bowl. 
2. Add the mix to an 8-inch (20-cm) pan and even it out with a spoon or the bottom of a cup. It's better if it's a springform pan, but you can also use a pan with a removable bottom. Put it in the fridge until the first layer is ready. 
3. Place 2.5 gelatin sheets into a small bowl of cold water. 
4. Add the dark chocolate and 1/4 cup (60g) of heavy milk into a heat-proof bowl. Place it over a saucepan with simmering water, and at low heat, stir it until the chocolate is melted. 
5. Add the gelatin sheets to the bowl with the chocolate and mix it really well. Then let everything cool down to room temperature or until it doesn't feel warm to the touch (be careful not to leave it too long so the mixture doesn't set). 
6. Whip the cup (240g) of heavy milk (better if it's chilled) in a big bowl until stiff peaks, and then add the melted chocolate and mix until combined. 
7. Add the mixture to the pan with the crust, and even it out. Leave it in the fridge until the next layer. 
8. For the strawberry layer, add the strawberries to a food processor and blend until they are liquid. (Optional: After it's liquid, pass it through a sieve in case you don't want seeds.) 
9. Place three gelatin sheets into a small bowl of cold water. 
10. Add the strawberry liquid and 1/4 cup (50g) of sugar to a medium-heat pan and stir until the sugar is mixed (a few mins).
11. Place the resulting liquid into a bowl, add the gelatin sheets, and mix it really well. Then leave it in the fridge until it's not warm to the touch, around 30–60 minutes. If the gelatin has started to set, whisk well until smooth and loose again. 
12. Whip the 1 + 1/4 cup (300g in total) of heavy milk (better if it's cold) until stiff peaks, and then add the strawberry mixture and mix until combined. 
13. Add the mixture over the first chocolate layer and leave it for at least 3 hours. 
14. To remove the cake from the pan, run a knife along the edges of the pan.
15.

&amp;#x200B;

**Preparation time:** 15 minutes

**Baking time:** 40-45 minutes

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for cake:**

\* 11.3oz plain flour, sieved (all purpose flour) 320g

\* 7oz of butter (room temp) 200g

\*8.8oz eggs (4 large, room temp) 250g

\* 6.3oz granulated white sugar, 180g

\* 2 flat tsp of baking powder

\* pinch of salt

\* 1tsp vanilla bean paste

\* 800g of fresh fruit (Strawberry, blueberry, rhubarb, apricots)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for crumble topping:**

\* plain flour 150g

\* granulated white sugar 120g

\* butter 120g

&amp;#x200B;

**Equipment:**

\* 13x9 inch baking tray (33cm x 23cm) If you prefer, you can also use a slightly smaller tray for this recipe. However, keep in mind that in that case, the baking time may be longer.

\* parchment paper

\* mixing bowl

\* standing mixer or hand mixer

\* spatula

\* cooling rack (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Polish Summer Fruit Cake:**

**1.** Preheat the fan-assisted oven to 365°F (180°C). Prepare a baking tray by greasing it lightly with oil and lining it with parchment paper to keep it in place.

**2.** For the cake batter, in a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until pale and fluffy. Reduce the speed to medium and gradually add the eggs one by one, ensuring they are well incorporated. Then, add the vanilla bean paste.

**3.** Stop the mixer and add the sifted flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix on low speed until the ingredients are fully incorporated. If the mixture appears too thick, add two tablespoons of milk or water and incorporate it.

**4.** Using a spatula, transfer the batter to the prepared baking tray and spread it evenly. Arrange the fruit on top; you can halve the strawberries, cut the rhubarb into chunks, and quarter the apricots.

**5.** To prepare the crumble topping, place all the crumble ingredients in a bowl and rub the mixture between your fingers until it is almost combined. Sprinkle the crumble evenly over the fruit.

**6.** Place the baking tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 40-45 minutes.

**7.** Once the cake is ready, allow it to cool for 10 minutes before serving. You can transfer it to a cooling rack, using a sheet of paper and the help of another person to expedite the cooling process.

**8.** Enjoy your delicious cake with a cup of coffee! Smacznego!

Serves: 10 | Cook time: 2 hours (plus 4 hours inactive time)

**Tart filling:**

* 1½ pounds rhubarb, trimmed and chopped (4 cups chopped rhubarb total)
* ½ cup sugar
* ½ cup water
* 4 drops of red food coloring, optional
* 6 egg yolks
* ½ cup sugar
* 6 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter; cut into cubes

**Rhubarb ice cream:**

* 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 16 ounces heavy cream
* ½ cup prepared rhubarb (from above)

**Tart crust:**

* ½ cup (53 g) whole pecans
* 1 cup flour
* ¼ cup (32 g) powdered sugar
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* For serving:
* Powdered sugar, optional

**Prepare the rhubarb:**

1. Combine the chopped rhubarb, ½ cup sugar, and ½ cup water in a medium pot and bring to a boil.
2. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30–45 minutes until very soft.
3. Use an immersion blender to blend until completely smooth. You may also use a traditional blender or food processor. Just pour the mixture back into the pot.
4. Let the rhubarb cool completely. Add the food coloring, if using, and mix well to incorporate.
5. Remove ½ cup of the rhubarb mixture from the pot and reserve for the homemade ice cream.

**Make the ice cream:**

1. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a medium mixing bowl and add the vanilla extract. Stir to combine.
2. Pour the heavy cream into a large mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, mix on medium speed until thick, stiff peaks form.
3. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into the heavy cream and gently fold everything together with a rubber spatula. Do not over-mix!
4. Pour the cream mixture into an 8-inch cake pan or loaf pan. Drizzle the reserved ½ cup of rhubarb on top and use the rubber spatula to swirl and mix into the cream gently.
5. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap. The wrap should be completely in contact with the ice cream without air bubbles. Use your hands to pat it down as tightly as possible. If there are air bubbles, ice crystals will form and make the top of your ice cream icy. Be sure the wrap is in contact with the ice cream from edge to edge. Transfer to the freezer until it is completely frozen, at least 4 hours.

**Prepare the tart crust:**

1. Preheat oven to 350ºF.
2. Place the pecans in a food processor and pulse them into a fine meal. Transfer to a mixing bowl with the flour and powdered sugar. Add ¼ teaspoon salt.
3. Melt the butter in the microwave or a small saucepan over the stovetop. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Let stand for 5 minutes. Pour the butter into the bowl of flour and pecans and use a rubber spatula to mix until there are no dry bits of flour and the dough is smooth and moist.
4. Place the dough into a 10” greased pie dish or tart pan. Use your hands to smooth it into the dish and up the sides in an even layer. Transfer to the oven for 15 minutes. Remove and let stand for 30 minutes. Keep the oven at 350ºF.

**Finish the filling:**

1. Add the egg yolks and remaining ½ cup sugar to the pot of the remaining rhubarb. Turn the heat back to medium and whisk until completely smooth.
2. Add the cold, cubed butter and continue whisking until the heat melts the butter completely. It will take 2–3 minutes of regular whisking. Continue whisking until completely smooth. Turn off the heat and immediately pour into the prepared crust.

**Bake the tart:**

1. Transfer the tart to the oven for 15 minutes; carefully rotate the tart once midway through cooking.
2. After 15 minutes, remove from the oven and do a jiggle check. It should be set up around the edges and slightly jiggly in the middle. It should wobble, not slosh. If it’s still very jiggly around the edges, return to the oven and continue baking in 2-minute increments until the tart is set around the edges but still jiggly in the middle. It should not need more than 20 minutes in the oven.

**Finish the tart:**

1. Let the tart stand for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, transfer to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight before serving.

**To serve:**

1. Slice the tart and carefully remove each piece. If you made this in a pie dish, it will be more difficult to serve but not impossible! Dust the tart with powdered sugar and serve with rhubarb ice cream on top.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients for Chocolate Tiffin:**

\* 5 oz butter (cubed (150g)

\* 3 tbsp caster sugar

\* 3 tbsp golden syrup

\* 6 tsp cocoa powder

\* 10 oz digestive biscuits (300g)

\* 4 oz milk chocolate (120g)

\* 4 oz dark chocolate (120g)

\* 1 tbsp icing sugar

&amp;#x200B;

**How to make Chocolate Tiffin:**

**1.** Begin by buttering a 15-20cm tin and lining it with baking parchment.

**2.** Melt the butter, sugar, syrup, and cocoa in a large saucepan, then stir in the biscuits.

**3.** In short 20-second bursts, melt both chocolates in the microwave, stirring frequently. Add half of the chocolate to the saucepan and mix well, reserving the second half.

**4.** Pour the mixture from the saucepan into the prepared tin, pressing down and smoothing the top with a spoon.

**5.** Pour the remaining chocolate on top of the mixture and use a palette knife or spoon to ensure that it is completely coated.

**6.** Place the tin in the refrigerator and leave it to set for around 2 hours or overnight. When set, remove the tin from the fridge and run a kitchen knife under hot water before cutting into squares. Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

**Tips on making Chocolate Tiffin:**

\* Use high-quality chocolate for the best flavour and texture.

\* If you don't have a microwave, you can melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water.

\* You can vary the type of biscuits you use, such as digestives, rich tea, or ginger snaps, to create different flavours and textures.

\* Allow the tiffin to cool and set completely in the fridge for the best results.

\* You can add other ingredients to the recipe, such as chopped nuts, dried fruit, or marshmallows, to create your own unique variations.",50,0.9399414062,Dessert,mienczaczek,1678119716000,https://i.redd.it/tbsfki4x95ma1.jpg,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11k3aob/chocolate_tiffin/,Chocolate tiffin,266.0,0.39,16.0,19.0,9.0,27.0,3.0,2.0,0.94

Serves 8 - 10

If you would like to make your own lemon curd for this roulade my recipe can be found on my website [here](https://www.leviathanfood.com/recipes/lemon-curd). I would also really appreciate any follows on social media channels if you like the site!

**INGREDIENTS**

* 6 large egg whites
* 335g caster sugar (super fine sugar in the US)
* 300ml rich double cream
* 180ml lemon curd
* 250g raspberries
* 250g blueberries
* 70g crushed de-shelled pistachios
* 2 passion fruit
* fresh mint

**METHOD**

1. Preheat oven to 150°C (300°F). Line a flat tray with parchment paper, you will be baking the meringue on this and don't want it to stick to the surface. I use a 38cm × 35cm tray, but you can use any large flat rectangular tray that will fit into your oven. You will be rolling along the longer edge, so this will be the finished length of your roulade.
2. Add the egg whites and half the caster sugar to a bowl, making sure that it's clean and completely dry before beginning. If there is any moisture left in the bowl, the egg whites won't form. whisk the mixture until it's formed light peaks. Once they have formed, gradually add the other half of the sugar until it forms stiff glossy peaks. This will take about 10-15 minutes. 
3. Spread the meringue mixture evenly onto the lined tray, squaring off the edges as best you can. Place in the oven and bake for one hour. It should be a very light golden colour when it's done. 
4. Remove tray from the oven and turn upside down onto a fresh sheet of parchment paper. Carefully peel off the backing sheet, working slowly and with a knife to scrape the paper gently away in one piece. There will be pockets of carmelised sugar stuck to the paper you want to get all those pieces off as they add a lovely gooey texture. 
5. Whip the double cream until thick and gently fold in the lemon curd, keeping the air you've incorporated during whipping. Spread the cream and curd mix over the flat meringue and cover with a layer of raspberries and blueberries, about 2/3 of the amount. 
6. Make a light score with a knife about 2cm in along one long edge of the meringue, this is going to help you as a starting point to roll it. From the indent, gently roll inwards away from yourself, using the paper underneath to help turn it as you go. You shouldn't be touching the surface of the meringue with your hands, use the paper to do that for you. The ""seam' will sit on the bottom once it's rolled. The outer surface will crack a little bit, you can patch it up if need be once it's served. 
7. When the roll is almost complete, grab the paper and use it to help you transfer the roulade to a plate. It's helpful if you have someone to give you a hand shifting it onto the serving plate, they can hold the plate steady while you transfer. Decorate with the remaining berries, crushed pistachios, passion fruit and mint.",1090,0.9799804688,Dessert,leviathanfood,1669688484000,https://i.redd.it/d92lbhgivs2a1.jpg,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/z7gjk9/meringue_roulade_with_lemon_curd_berries_crushed/,Almond & lemon meringue roulade,394.0,0.1,25.0,36.0,13.0,38.0,4.0,0.0,0.96

Method:

1. preheat fan/convection oven to 170degrees Celsius (350 f)

3. Soften or melt 250g (8 oz) butter and cream/whisk with 2 and a quarter cup of sugar (I go 1 cup raw and 1 and 1/4 white - sometimes I make it 1 and half white). (*Melted butter will give a tighter brownie, creamed butter will give a softer crumb, choose your outcome*)

4. Beat in 4 eggs and a teaspoon of vanilla flavouring/extract.

5. Add a pinch of salt. Sift in 3/4 cup of cocoa powder and combine thoroughly using a spatula.

6. Sift in 1 and a third cups of flour with 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. And fold in gently until there are no streaky flour lumps. Add in a cup of chocolate chunks (I chop up a bar of my fave dark chocolate.

You can see how I made them [here](https://youtu.be/2-UHpZe1Qno).

*INGREDIENTS:*

**Sponge**

* 300g all purpose flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 170g unsalted butter, room temperature
* 220g granulated sugar
* 115 Greek yogurt
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 egg, room temperature
* 250ml milk, room temperature

**Frosting**

* 200g unsalted butter, room temperature
* Pinch of salt
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 3 tbs whipping cream

**Coating**

* 400g candy melts, white chocolate, or milk chocolate
* Coconut oil or commercial thinning flakes, to thin the coating if needed
* Sprinkles, if desired.

*METHOD:*

**Sponge**

1. In a bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and salt and mix well. Set aside.with a stand or hand mixer, beat butter and sugar. When sugar is fully incorporated, add yogurt, vanilla, egg, and milk and mix thoroughly.
2. Slowly add the dry ingredients and mix on low until fully incorporated.Pour the batter into two 8’ pans lined with parchment paper.
3. Bake at 350ºF/176ºC for 25-30 minutes. The cake will be done when a toothpick is inserted and comes out clean.
4. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, invert the cakes onto a cooling rack and allow to cool completely.

**Frosting**

1. Beat butter. Sift in powdered sugar in batches and mix well in between.
2. Once sugar is fully mixed into the butter, add the salt and vanilla extract and mix.
3. Add the whipping cream, about a tablespoon at a time, and beat on high until frosting is even and fluffy.

**Cake Ball Assembly**

1. Crumble the cake evenly into a bowl. Remove any tough pieces.Add approximately 75-100g of frosting. Mix until the frosting is evenly distributed among the cake, ensuring the cake retains a crumbly texture.
2. To test, gently squeeze some of the mix into a ball. If it retains its shape, it should be ready.Roll into 30g balls and place onto a lined cookie sheet.
3. Refrigerate for 2 hours minimum.

**Coating**

1. Melt the candy melts/chocolate. If it is too thick, it can be thinned down with refined cocounut oil or commercial thinning flakes. Add just a little at a time and mix well to avoid cracking or an uneven finish.
2. Dip a lollipop stick into the coating and insert the stick into the cake ball.
3. Dip the cake ball into the coating and gently tap the side to remove excess.
4. Spoon sprinkles onto the cake pop.
5. Insert the stick into a styrofoam block and allow the coating to set for 1 hour minimum.",126,0.9702148438,Dessert,shushyum,1663618095000,https://i.redd.it/eelqkz7g6vo91.jpg,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/xiljp1/cake_pops/,Cake pops,295.0,0.4,16.0,28.0,10.0,34.0,3.0,0.3,0.76

wwdx4c,White Chocolate Cheesecake,"['sugar', 'vanilla', 'philadelphia cream cheese', 'butter', 'eggs', 'graham cracker crumbs', 'half-n-half cream', 'nestles white chocolate morsels', 'spray-on oil']",american,"Ingredients:

* ¾ cup sugar (¼ for the crust and ½ for the batter)
* ½ tsp. Vanilla (use real vanilla extract)
* 3 x 8 oz. “bricks” of Philadelphia cream cheese (“full fat”)
* 4 tbsp. (½ stick) butter (not margarine)
* 3 large eggs
* 2 cups graham cracker crumbs (you could try chocolate cookie crumbs)
* ½ pint “half-n-half"" cream
* 24 oz. Nestles white chocolate morsels (4 cups)
* Spray-on oil (Pam)

Let the cream cheese warm overnight. Let the eggs warm for an hour.

1. Set up a double-boiler and add the white chocolate morsels and half-n-half. Stir occasionally.
2. In a small pot, put the butter on a low heat to melt.
3. In a small mixing bowl add the Graham cracker crumbs and ¼ cup sugar, and mix thoroughly.
4. In a large mixing bowl add ½ cup sugar, the vanilla and the cream cheese.
5. Mix in the three eggs one at a time, mixing as little as possible; you just want to distribute the eggs through the mixture. I use a large serving fork, and only “pull” through the cream cheese 3 times for each egg.
6. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
7. Spray a springform pan with a medium-to-heavy coat of spray on oil.
8. Add the melted butter to the smaller mixing bowl and mix thoroughly. “Dump” the small mixing bowl contents into the springform pan, distribute evenly, and tamp down lightly and evenly with something with a flat bottom (I use a drinking glass). Only press down with about 18 to 20 pounds of pressure.
9. Stir the chocolate until it's fully melted. Add the melted chocolate to the large mixing bowl.
10. Using a hand mixer on the lowest setting, mix the batter until the largest “shreds” of cream cheese you can see are about 1/8 inch long.
11. Pour the batter into the springform pan, and cover with aluminum foil. Lightly crimp the foil around the top of the pan all the way around.
12. Place in the oven for 1 hour.
13. After the hour, shut the oven off and prop the door open very slightly; don’t open it to the first “detent” (about 3 inches); I use the handle of a wooden spoon inserted as little as possible to keep it in place. After two hours, take the cheesecake out of the oven and put it on the counter for two hours.
14. Take off the foil; at this point you will think the it's “underdone”. The middle will have the consistency of cheesecake pudding. Release the “lock” on the springform pan and use a dinner knife to separate the cheesecake from the pan by running it around the inside edge of the pan. Then open the lock fully and lift the outer part of the pan off the base.
15. Put it in the refrigerator at least 12 hours, 24 is better.",2112,0.9902343750000001,Dessert,Waldron1943,1661333307000,https://i.redd.it/fpsbxj3jgmj91.jpg,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/wwdx4c/white_chocolate_cheesecake/,White chocolate cheesecake,801.0,0.8,66.0,30.0,40.0,43.0,8.0,1.0,0.9

uk8dl7,4-Ingredient Chocolate Pudding,"['milk', 'sugar', 'agar-agar powder', 'milk chocolate']",japanese,"Ingredients:  
- Milk 500ml  
- Sugar 90g  
- Agar- Agar Powder 7g  
- Milk Chocolate 150g  
  
Recipe:  
1. Mix Milk, Sugar, and Agar-Agar Powder until dissolved in a pot  
2. Cut Milk Chocolate into small pieces, add into pot  
3. Boil the mix until thick  
4. Pour into a rectangular mold, cool down for 1 hour, fridge for a few hours  

TIPS

* Using milk chocolate gives you the unmissable sweetness, but if you're a fan of dark chocolate, then just replace and add a little more sugar to balance things out.
* Use a spatula to help pry it loose from the mold, it should come out pretty easily after the sides have been loosened
* Eat it as is, or with whipped cream for that texture differential.
* The pudding is much much better cold, so be sure to keep it in the fridge for a few hours after it has cooled down. DO NOT KEEP THE HOT PUDDING IN THE FRIDGE, it will raise the temperature of the fridge significantly, giving possibility to spoil other things.

**Method:**

1. Take Fillo Pastry out of the fridge at least 2 hours before use to bring it up to room temperature.
2. Preheat oven to 160 deg. C. Grease a deep 40 cm x 30 cm baking pan with melted butter.

**Syrup**: 

1. Stir sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium heat, until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Stir in orange water, cinnamon, cloves, rinds and lemon juice. 
2. Allow to cool completely. Syrup must be cooled prior to pouring over the cook Baklava at Assembly step 5.

**Filling:** 

1. In a food processor, blend almonds and pistachios until they resemble coarse breadcrumbs. Add the ground cinnamon and ground cloves and mix well.

**Assembly:** 

1. Place one sheet of Fillo Pastry on a clean work surface with the short edge facing you. Drizzle with melted butter. Cover with another sheet of Fillo Pastry and drizzle with butter. Sprinkle 3 tbsp of nut mixture over the top half of the Fillo sheets.
2. Place two bamboo skewers across the middle of the Fillo sheet. Fold Fillo in half over the skewers. Slowly roll the Fillo over the skewers, away from you to form a log. Gently press ends of the log in towards the centre to create a wrinkled effect and to complete the log. Pick up the log, place in the tray and remove the bamboo skewers. Butter each log as you complete to prevent them from drying out.
3. Repeat with remaining Fillo Pastry and nut mixture until the tray is full. Cut the saragli into thirds and then pour over remaining butter.
4. Bake in preheated oven for 45 mins or until golden brown.
5. Remove Saragli from the oven and pour over cooled syrup immediately.

***Preparation:***

1.Preheat the oven to 180C(350F). Prepare a 18cm(7-inch) baking pan; set aside.

2.Sift dry ingredients together. Place sugar, eggs and salt into a mixer bowl and whisk until light and fluffy. Add dry ingredients(in 2 batches) into the batter and mix on a low speed. Add milk and melted butter and continue mixing. At the end add boiling water and mix until well combined.

3.Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and put it in the oven and bake for 40min until done. Insert a toothpick into the center of the cake if it comes out clean, it is done. Remove from the oven and turn the cake over onto the cooling rack. When the cake is completely cooled, cover it with plastic cling wrap and put in the fridge to rest overnight.

4.Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Put the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring it to a gentle boil. Do not stir the caramel. Gently swirl the pot to even out the sauce. Cook the caramel until it is a golden-brown color. Remove from the heat and add hot milk while whisking. Leave it aside to cool down a little then add the butter and salt, mix well till everything is incorporated.

5.Beat heavy cream with powdered sugar, cream cheese and vanilla extract until thick and smooth.

6.Using a large serrated knife, level the top of the cake and split into 3-4 layers of equal thickness.Using a palette knife, spread about 3-4 tablespoons of the frosting evenly across the bottom layer. Using a round piping nozzle, pipe a ring of frosting around the edge of the cake.Spread a layer of the caramel in the middle of the cake, then sprinkle with crushed shortcake biscuits. Repeat for the next layer.

7.Top the cake with the final layer, and spread the cream cheese frosting on the top and sides of the cake. Use a palette knife or cake side scraper to take off the excess buttercream and give a smooth finish. Chill the frosted cake for 15 minutes in the fridge, to allow the layer of frosting to firm up.

8.Add another layer of frosting to the top and sides of the cake, and remove the excess. Chill the frosted cake for another 15 minutes in the fridge.

9.Pour heavy cream into a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave on high until very hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chocolate chips to heated cream; whisk until smooth. Set aside to firm up a little – you want the ganache to be pourable but not too runny.

10.Fill the piping bag or squeeze bottle with the ganache you’ve made. Place the edge of the piping bag on the edge of the cake and gently squeeze the bag – the more you squeeze the more it will drip. Make it all around the cake.

11.Using a star nozzle, pipe swirls of frosting around the top of the cake; then spread another layer of the caramel, and sprinkle with crushed shortcake biscuits.

12.Top each swirl with a piece of Twix mini-bar.

Yield: 12 Rolls

If you'd like to see any part of this process, I've made a video, divided by chapters and you can click [here](https://youtu.be/COqDYsxOpHw) to go directly to it.

**Ingredients:**

Dough:

* 350g all-purpose flour
* 200g pumpkin puree
* 60g warm water
* 60g warm 2% milk
* 3 tbsp butter
* 2 1/4 tsp (1 pkg) dry active yeast
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt

Pumpkin Pie Spice:

* 1/2 tsp cloves
* 1 tsp allspice
* 3/4 tsp nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp ginger
* 1 tbsp cinnamon

Filling:

* 1/4 cup margarine (or butter, but I always forget to leave extra out)
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1 recipe \^\^\^ of pumpkin pie spice (roughly 2 tbsp)

Maple Cardamom Icing:

* 4 oz. warm cream cheese
* 1/4 cup 2% milk
* 60g maple syrup
* 1/4 tsp cardamom seed, ground
* 2 tbsp icing sugar

**Preparation:**

1. Mix together water, milk, yeast and 1 tbsp brown sugar.
2. When yeast is nice and foamy, add in all remaining dough ingredients except for 175g (or half) of flour and use a wooden spoon or paddle attachment to mix until combined.
3. Add remaining flour and knead in stand mixer on medium-high for about 5-6 minutes.
4. When dough is smooth and elastic, set aside in greased bowl to rise until doubled in size, approximately 1 hour.
5. While the dough is resting, you can make the spice mixture and icing by just combining the ingredients listed.
6. When dough has doubled in size, flour the top lightly, press out majority of the gas, and flip out onto a generously floured table.
7. Roll dough into a rectangle roughly 1/8 inch thick. You can either flour the top of the dough lightly or a rolling pin for this. I floured my dough.
8. Brush rolled out dough with 1/4 cup of margarine or soft butter, (I used margarine because my memory is similar to that of a goldfish and it's spreadable straight from the fridge) then evenly spread brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice overtop of the margarine.
9. Starting with one of the long sides, gently roll the dough up tightly, trying to avoid large gaps or air bubbles that may make the rolls fall apart.
10. Cut the resulting log into 12 equal pieces and set them cut sides down in a 9 inch oven-safe pan, covered, for 45 minutes to proof.
11. Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 20-25 minutes, until nicely browned and cooked through.

​

TIPS:  
\- If your dough is too soft to be worked with at any point, place it in the freeze for \~10 minutes before continuing, this helps to set it, although you must work quickly as it becomes soft very fast. 

  
\- Oranges contain natural pectin, if you don't have pectin I suggest to use the peels of the oranges themselves (look up how on the internet). However pectin makes the it really easy to make any sort of jams, so i highly recommend to buy it from the store.

  
\- You can make dehydrated/candied Orange slices by placing slices into the oven for around 2-4 hours at around 100°C. Lovely for decoration.

  
\- You can definitely use a normal baking pan for this recipe. However, the perforated ring helps to make it look super professional. If you plan on using a normal baking pan, I suggest the blind bake method

Desserts and Baking Cookbook"" by Ysanne Spevack. 

**Ingredients:**

160 g Pitted Dates

120 ml Hot Tea

1 cup Whole Wheat flour

1 cup All -Purpose Flour

2 tsp baking powder

1/2 tsp sea salt

3/4 cups cold unsalted butter

1 egg

2 tsp vanilla extract

1/2 cup almond milk

1 egg

Powdered Monk Fruit Sweetener for topping (optional)

&amp;#x200B;

**Recipe:**

Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit 

Chop or grind dates and pour hot tea over them. Let them sit for 5 minutes.

Sift flours, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Rub the butter quickly and lightly into flour with fingers until the consistency of bread crumbs. 

Drain dates  and discard the liquid. Mix in dates using fingers

Beat egg, vanilla and almond milk together in a small town. Gradually pour egg mixture into the flour mixture a bit at  time. Dough should be wet and sticky but still hold form. Set aside extra egg mixture. 

Dust contour with flour and flatten dough using hands into a rectangle about 2.5cm/1in thick and 6cm/2.5in wide. 

For American-style scones, cut the dough in quarters, and then on a reverse diagonal, cut into eights. Pick up each one, and quickly dust each side so scone is completely dusted. 

Put scones on baking sheet spaced at least 2.5cm/1in apart, as thy will spread when baked. Quickly brush the scones with the remaining egg mixture. 

Bake 14-20 minutes in the preheated open until rise and golden. Dust with powdered monk fruit sweetener with a sifter or eat as is or with butter.

*For the pastry:*  
\- 300g plain white flour

\- 100g caster sugar  
\- 110g unsalted butter at room temperature  
\- 2 eggs  
\- 1 teaspoon almond extract  
   
  
**Method**  
  
1. For the pastry, start by adding the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor. Cut the cold butter (it needs to be cold and firm) into medium cubes (approximately 1x1 inch) and distrbute the cubes on top of the dry ingredients. Pulse 16 times.  
  
2. Turn off the food processor, add the egg yolk and turn it back on its lowest setting. While it is running, add 2-3 tablespoons of water and process for up to 10 seconds, just enough to combine.

Each spoonful asks for another and when everything is gone you look for more, addiction? Very likely!

Preparation is simple but it takes a little bit of waiting for the layers to set. Everything that takes time tastes a lot better and we are here for the quality of flavour! Enjoy cooking friends!

**The Biscuit Base**

For the base layer of the Tiramisu Cheesecake, you can use any type of digestive biscuits. I choose one cover with chocolate to add another layer of love to the recipe.

Be very careful not to add too much butter to the base as this will solidify it too much and you will not be able to dig in. We finish this layer with a nice shot of espresso but you can try different things to your liking.

**Chocolate Middle**

This layer is basically thick chocolate ganache with the liquor, you can skip alcohol completely and substitute it with almond extract or other baking aromas.

**Cheesecake Topping**

For this creamy layer, I like to use full-fat Philadelphia cheese, you can opt for a lighter version and lower the amount of sugar by half but why would you do this? It is a sin worthy dessert! I always recommend vanilla bean paste over the extract but use what's in your cupboard and it will still taste superb. You can also add any type of citrus zest that you like to create another layer of freshness in this dessert.

**Garnish**

If you go for simplicity and a more classical look cocoa powder is just fine. To elevate more use crushed dark chocolate or super tasty chocolate espresso beans.

**Ingredients for base:**

150g (5.3oz) of chocolate digestive biscuits

30g (1oz) of melted butter

3tsp of strong espresso

**Ingredients for chocolate layer:**

250g (8.8oz) of milk chocolate (drops or finely chopped)

150ml of double cream

100ml of coffee flavoured liquor like Tia Maria or Kahlua

**Ingredients for the cheesecake layer:**

150g (5.3oz) of cream cheese

100ml of double cream

1tsp vanilla bean paste

50g (1.7oz) of icing sugar

Total Cook Time: 1 hour

Servings: 4

Calories: 544kcal per serving

**Ingredients**

* 1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined
* ½ teaspoon sumac
* 1 teaspoon Aleppo pepper
* 1 lemon, juiced and zested; juice and zest kept separate
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1 shallot, peeled and diced
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* 3 heaping tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 cups water, plus more if needed
* 2 teaspoons brown sugar, more or less to taste
* 12 ounces linguine
* ⅓ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, a pinch reserved for garnish
* ⅓ cup loosely packed parsley, minced, plus more for serving
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the shrimp:**

1. Place the shrimp in a bowl and season with sumac, Aleppo pepper, salt, and pepper. Add half the lemon juice and all of the lemon zest. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.

**Make the sauce:**

1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the butter. Add the shallot once the butter is melted and cook for 3–5 minutes until soft.
2. Add the garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper. (Note: I like it spicy, so I add a good amount of crushed red pepper; add as much as you like, and you can always add more later!) Cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.
3. Add the tomato paste to the pot and mash it into the aromatics for 2–3 minutes until it deepens in color and sticks to the bottom.
4. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, add 1 teaspoon brown sugar, and simmer for 30 minutes until reduced by half. Add more water if the liquid evaporates too quickly. After simmering, taste the sauce and add the remaining 1 teaspoon brown sugar if needed. Add salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a generous pinch of salt. Once boiling, add the linguine and cook until al dente. Reserve ½ cup pasta water and then drain the linguine and set aside.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings once more. Add half the pasta water and bring to a boil. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and minced parsley and stir until the cheese melts into the sauce.
2. Reduce the heat to medium and add the shrimp and the remaining lemon juice to the sauce. Cook for 5–8 minutes until almost opaque.
3. Add the linguine to the sauce and toss to coat, adding the remaining pasta water only as needed to loosen up the sauce. Once the shrimp are completely opaque, turn off the heat and transfer to a serving platter.

**To serve:**

1. Garnish the pasta with a pinch of freshly grated Parmesan and more minced parsley if you like.

I love it because it's no-mess...you don't have to dice them or blanch them and you won't have skins in the sauce.

You just grate on the large holes of a box grater and you can whizz through a bunch of tomatoes in like 5 mins. You want to use juicy, super ripe tomatoes...avoid Roma tomatoes as they are too dry/firm.

I use this process for homemade salsa because honestly, i just hate chopping up tomatoes (I have slight eczema on my fingers and the acidity of tomatoes really effs up my fingers) so grating is a really nice way to prep them for me!

Just be mindful that there's a LOT of water in the grated tomatoes so you want to cook it off. I don't like straining them because I like cooking down the liquid; I think it makes a more flavorful sauce.

**Ingredients:**

* 1½ pounds large, ripe tomatoes (or use 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes)
* 1 pound hot Italian sausage
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2 small zucchini, trimmed and diced
* Crushed red pepper to taste
* Pinch of sugar optional
* 16 ounces rigatoni
* 5 ounces baby spinach
* 1 lemon, juiced
* ½ cup Parmesan, finely grated; a pinch reserved for garnish
* Salt and pepper

**Prep the tomatoes:**

1. Cut off a very thin slice from the bottom of the tomatoes.
2. Grate the tomatoes into a large bowl using the large holes of a box grater. Discard the skins.

**Cook the sausage:**

1. Heat a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the sausage and cook, breaking it up periodically, for 12–15 minutes until cooked through. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and drain off all but a teaspoon of the oil in the pot.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the onion. Cook for 5–7 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and zucchini and fry for 1–2 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper to taste.
2. Return the sausage to the pot and pour in the grated tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20–30 minutes or until the sauce is thick. Stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from sticking. The grated tomatoes make quite a bit of excess water, so you want to cook it all off!  Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Boil the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add a generous amount of salt and the rigatoni. Cook until 1-2 minutes under al dente. Scoop out 1/2 cup pasta water and drain the pasta.

**Finish the pasta:**

1. Taste the sauce and season once more. Add the baby spinach, lemon juice, and cooked pasta. Toss to coat for 2–3 minutes until the spinach is wilted. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and toss to coat for 1 minute more. Add pasta water if needed to loosen up the sauce and coat the pasta. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls. Sprinkle more Parmesan on each plate.

1. Remove the parmesan rind from the sauce and discard it. Sprinkle a bit of mozzarella on top of each piece of chicken. Drizzle the mozzarella with a touch of extra virgin olive oil, if you like. Transfer the pot back to the oven under the broiler, and broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Turn off the broiler and remove the pot from the oven.

I think pasta al forno may typically have pork, veal, or sausage in it...I made mine with mushrooms, but you can add whatever meat you want. just cook it first, then do the mushrooms, and so on...and add the cooked meat back with the tomatoes.

**Mushroom-tomato sauce:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil, plus more if needed
* 1 pound mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1/2 teaspoon dry thyme
* Crushed red pepper, to taste
* 1/4 cup sweet vermouth
* 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
* 8-ounce jar tomato sauce of choice
* Pinch of sugar
* 10 basil leaves, roughly chopped
* 1/3 cup fresh parsley, minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Béchamel:**

* 1/4 cup butter
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 2 1/2 cups whole milk, warmed in the microwave for 1–2 minutes
* Pinch of white pepper
* Salt

**For assembly:**

* 16 ounces rigatoni
* 6 ounces grated mozzarella
* 4 ounces grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
* Freshly ground black pepper
* Fresh basil, for serving

**Prepare the mushroom-tomato sauce:**

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF.
2. heat neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add half the mushrooms and cook for 8–10 minutes until they turn golden brown and crisp up around the edges. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl. Add a bit more oil and the remaining mushrooms, and cook an additional 8–10 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of mushrooms.
3. Add the onion to the pot and cook for 5–6 minutes until it begins to soften. Return the mushrooms to the pot and add the garlic, dry thyme, and a big pinch of crushed red pepper.
4. Turn the heat to high, and as soon as the mushrooms begin sizzling hard in the pot (be careful not to burn them!), pour in the sweet vermouth. Stir to lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat and cook for 3–4 minutes.
5. Add the crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce to the pot and bring to a boil. Add a pinch of sugar if you like. Reduce heat and stir in the basil and parsley. Simmer, uncovered, for 30–40 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the pasta:**

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Add 3/4 of the sauce from the pot and toss to coat. Set aside.

**Prepare the béchamel:**

1. Melt the butter in a pot over medium heat. Once bubbly and melted, add the flour. Stir it into the butter and cook for 1–2 minutes until nutty and fragrant.
2. Add a ladle of the milk and whisk constantly until a slurry forms. Continue ladling in the milk, whisking after each addition, until all the milk has been incorporated and the sauce is smooth. Simmer over medium-low for 5–10 minutes or until the béchamel is thick. Season with white pepper and salt. Turn off the heat.

**Assemble the casserole:**

1. Add half the remaining sauce to the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Add half the pasta and smooth it into an even layer. Pour half the béchamel on top. Sprinkle with half the mozzarella and half the Parmigiano-Reggiano.
2. Pour the remaining half of the pasta on top and cover with the remaining sauce. Use the back of your spoon to smooth everything into an even layer. Finish with the remaining béchamel and smooth it out. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmigiano-Reggiano on top. Finish with freshly cracked black pepper.

**Bake the pasta:**

1. Transfer to the oven and bake for 30 minutes until bubbly. At the end of cooking, turn on the broiler and broil the top for 1–2 minutes until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let stand 5–10 minutes.

**To serve:**

1. Sprinkle fresh basil on top of the pasta and serve.

It’s not on the menu currently, but it was orecchiette in a red sauce and topped with small pieces of pan-fried eggplant. It was then topped with grated ricotta salata (the traditional way to serve pasta alla norma!). I didn’t have ricotta salata, so I omitted it for this recipe.

For the eggplant, you can follow the Ottolenghi approach to peeling which involves alternating peeling off strips so the eggplant ends up looking like a zebra. Or, you can follow the Tram Tram (and my) approach and leave the skin on completely.

This pasta alla norma is a yummy take on pasta with crispy eggplant. Serve it with orecchiette and simple marinara for a delish dinner!

I absolutely LOVE corn salsa, and every time I have it I wish it was acceptable to just skip the chips and eat it with a spoon! 😂 So this dish was intended to have all the delicious flavors of corn salsa, but as a pasta salad!  
  
This pasta salad is a perfect side dish for your next summer BBQ! One batch makes around 9-10 cups (so about 10 small side servings) perfect for a gathering. Or, store it in the fridge for a week’s worth of quick lunches! When preparing keep the extra ingredients on hand so you can add more of anything to your liking at the end. Make it your own with your favorite spices or ingredients! 

**Makes: 9-10 cups** (about 10 small side servings)

# Ingredients

* 12 oz orecchiette pasta (or similar)
* 4 ears of corn (makes about 4 cups of kernels)
* 1 ½ cups red onion, finely chopped (about 1 medium red onion)
* ½ cup jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced (about 1-2 jalapeños)
* ½ cup cilantro leaves, roughly chopped
* ½ cup fresh lime juice (juice from 2-3 medium limes)
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tsp chili powder (I use medium heat)

**Ingredients:**

* 2 yellow onions, peeled and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 1 fennel bulb, cored and thinly sliced into wedges
* 1 tablespoon avocado oil
* 1 teaspoon sugar, optional
* 1/2 cup pistachios, crushed
* .6 ounces sage leaves, divided
* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 16 ounces rigatoni. 3/4 cup pasta cooking water reserved
* 12 ounces ricotta
* 1 lemon, juiced and zested
* 1-2 tablespoons whole milk, if needed
* 2 tablespoons butter
* Salt and pepper to taste

Method:

1. Caramelize the onion and fennel: Heat avocado oil in a wide pot over medium-low heat. Add the onions and fennel and cook, stirring regularly, for 30-35 minutes until the onions and fennel deepen in color. Season with salt and pepper. You can add a little sugar, if you like them a bit sweeter.
2. Crisp the sage: Heat 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add half the sage leaves, in batches, and cook for 2-3 seconds until crispy. Immediately transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season  with salt. Reserve the oil.
3. Mince the remaining half of the sage and set aside.
4. Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta til al dente. Reserve 3/4 cup pasta water. Drain pasta. *Note: try to time this so that you're draining the pasta right as the onions finish caramelizing.*
5. Make the whipped ricotta: Combine the ricotta with lemon juice and zest and season with salt. Using a hand mixer, blend until very  smooth and creamy. If needed, add a splash or two of milk. Pour in half the reserved sage oil and continue blending until creamy. Set aside.
6. Finish the pistachios: Crush all but 4 of the crispy sage leaves and toss with the pistachios. Season with salt and set aside.
7. Finish the pasta: Melt the butter into the caramelized onions. Add the minced sage and cook 1 minute. add 1/2 cup reserved pasta cooking water and bring to a boil. Cook for 3-4 minutes until thickened and reduced slightly. If needed, add more water. Add the pasta and toss to coat. Turn off the heat.
8. To Serve: Divide the whipped ricotta between plates and add a touch more of the reserved sage oil on top. Pile the pasta on top and garnish with the pistachios. Place a crispy sage leave on top.

na4j9l,Butter poached lobster with a parmesan herb butter linguine!,"['linguine', 'lobster tail', 'butter', 'garlic', 'oregano', 'parsley', 'parmesan', 'heavy cream']",italian,"RECIPE!!

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------

&amp;#x200B;

\* Linguine

\* 

\* Two small or one large lobster tail

\* 

\* 4 sticks of COLD butter for the poach, +3 tablespoons for the sauce

\* 

\* 4 cloves of garlic

\* 

\* 3 Tablespoons of fresh oregano

\* 

\* 3 Tablespoons of fresh parsley

\* 

\* 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesan, +more for plating

\* 

\* 3/4 cup of heavy cream

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Linguine noodles boiled in heavily salted water to just about al dente.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

FOR THE LOBSTER

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The lobster was butter poached, so I took about a tablespoon and a half of water, boiled it, reduced the temperature to low and added a clove of smashed garlic and some cracked black pepper, adding a tablespoon of COLD butter and whisking maniacally until just about dissolved and then adding another tablespoon of butter, repeat that, whisking nonstop until all of your butter is melted. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason for the nonstop whisking is you're creating a butter emulsification to poach the lobster in. The amount of butter you'll need will vary depending on the amount of lobster you have and the size of your pot. You want the lobster to be fully submerged! 

&amp;#x200B;

The cook time will vary on the size of your lobster tail, so about 5-8 minutes is a safe bet. You don't want to overcook it! 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

FOR THE SAUCE

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Start off with 3 tablespoons of butter on medium low temperature to melt it, add 3 cloves of smashed garlic, let that cook for a few minutes to get that butter all garlicy and junk, add the fresh oregano and parsley and about a cup of the pasta water, bring that to a simmer, add a half a cup of fresh grated parmesan, getting it all melty and delicious, after that's all melted, add 3/4 a cup of cream, bring that to a simmer, add desired amount of pasta to pan, get it all stirred up and junk and let it all get to know each other over medium low heat for about 10 minutes until the sauce thickens up to your desired consistency!

&amp;#x200B;

Plate up and top with some more grated parmesan and some of that delicious lobster poaching butter sauce!

The ingredients are simple and genuine, the making of tortellini requires a little time and commitment but the taste worth the effort without doubt.

Fun fact: Legend claims that Tortellini was inspired by the goddess Venus' navel. One evening after a day of battle between Bologna and Modena, Venus, Bacchus and Mars found refreshment at the inn Corona in Castelfranco Emilia. The next morning Mars and Bacchus moved away from the inn leaving Venus dormant;

When she woke up, she called the other companions to hear where they were. the innkeeper came to see if he could help and saw the little-dressed goddess was so impressed by its splendid shapes that he returned to the kitchen and created a pasta inspired by Venus' navel…and so was born the Tortellini.

Serving for about 6 persons

**INGREDIENTS**

For the filling

* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) pork loin
* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) mortadella
* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )
* 150 gr ( 5.29 ounce ) grated parmigiano
* 10 gr ( 0.35 ounce )  butter
* 2 eggs
* nutmeg
* black pepper
* salt

&amp;#x200B;

For the dough

* 320 gr ( 11.29 ounce ) all-purpose  flour
* 80 gr ( 2.82 ounce ) semolina flour
* 4 eggs
* 25 gr ( 0.88 ounce ) extra virgin olive oil
* salt

&amp;#x200B;

**INSTRUCTION**

* in a pan put 10 gr butter and 100 gr pork loin diced
* let the pork loin brown well and drain from the excess of butter
* in a meat grinder put the pork loin, 100 gr mortadella and 100 gr cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )
* add to the mixture half nutmeg grated, 150 gr grated parmigiano, black pepper and 2 eggs
* Mix well the mixture and add salt if needed ( you should taste the mixture because the flavor can vary depending on the type of cured ham and mortadella)
* cover with a plastic wrap and let it rest for 2 hours

Now let's prepare the homemade pasta as usual so 1 egg every 100 gr flours. For the flours we will use all-purpose and semolina flour in a proportion 4 to 1 so for this filling about 320 gr all-purpose and 80 gr semolina flour

* Put the flours on a pastry board making a hole in the center where you will put 4 whole eggs and 25 gr extra virgin olive oil.
* With a fork amalgamate the eggs and let the flour be incorporated, salt the dough and continue this operation until it will be possible to work it by hand.
* work the dough until it is smooth and even. Leave it to rest in a film in the fridge for 30 minutes at least.
* work the dough with a rolling pin and divide in several part
* now with the help of a pasta machine begin to lower the thickness of the dough
* the dough will be ready when it is less of one millimetre thick. I usually use the lower setting of thickness
* now cut the pasta dough to obtain squares 4 cm long, i use a pasta cutter to obtain several squares at the time and speed up the process
* Take a pasta square and put a little of filling in the middle then fold the square into a triangle. Finally, roll up the triangle and join the angles creating the typical shape of the tortellini like you can see in the video
* if the pasta dries too much you can moisten the edges of the dough square with a finger wetted in a little water. this will help to seal the tortellini.
* Put the tortellini on a tray lined with parchment paper. If you want you can also frozen tortellini, to do so put the tray in freezer a few hours, in this way they will remain intact and will not stick during freezing, when the tortellini are well frozen you can transfer them in bags to save space in the freezer
* Cook tortellini into boiling beef and poultry stock. If frozen, do not unfreeze.
* You can also prepare tortellini without broth. Cook them in abundant salted water, when they are ready ( 4/5 minutes usually) drain them and season with a heavy cream sauce with ham and peas. If you want more precise instruction for this kind of seasoning ask in the comment section

* 2½ pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and quartered
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 head of garlic, top cut off
* Salt

**Stew**:

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 leek, white part only; trimmed, scrubbed, and sliced into rings
* 4 ribs celery, trimmed and diced
* 1 fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced
* 3 carrots, peeled and diced
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme
* 1 cup yellow split peas, rinsed and picked over
* 4 cups chicken broth from above
* 5 scallions, trimmed and minced
* 1 lemon, juiced
* Salt and pepper

**Make the broth:**

1. Place the chicken, onion, bay leaf, and head of garlic in a pot. Cover with 6 cups of water. Add more if needed to submerge the chicken fully. Add 2 teaspoons salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes or until the chicken is completely cooked.
2. Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a bowl. Transfer the garlic to a small plate.
3. Turn the heat on the broth to medium and continue simmering until it reduces and deepens in color, about 10–15 minutes. Reduce the liquid to about 4 cups. It’s okay if you have a little more or a little less.
4. Strain the broth through a fine mesh sieve into a large bowl. Discard solids. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.

**Prepare the chicken and garlic:**

1. Carefully pick the chicken from the bones. Shred the chicken and set it aside. You can freeze the bones for stock if you like. You can fry the chicken skin for a crunchy garnish or discard it.
2. Pop the garlic cloves from the paper and mash them into a paste with a fork. Set aside.

**Make the stew:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the leek, celery, fennel, carrots, and sauté for 10–15 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed to prevent them from burning. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Add the dry thyme, garlic paste, and yellow split peas to the pot. Toss to coat and cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt.

**Simmer the stew:**

1. Pour in 4 cups of broth and shredded chicken. See note.
2. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer uncovered for 30–45 minutes or until the yellow split peas are very tender. Cook for 30 minutes if you prefer a firmer split pea; longer if you prefer a creamier texture. Stir occasionally and gently mash the split peas, adding more water if the broth evaporates too quickly. Taste and add salt and pepper.

**Finish the stew:**

1. Once the stew is thick and creamy, stir in half the minced scallions and the lemon juice. Simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the stew into bowls. Garnish with the remaining scallions. Enjoy!

***Note:*** 

*If you have less than 4 cups of broth, add more water to supplement. If you have more, start with 4 cups of broth and add the remaining as needed. You can also add all the broth and simply simmer it a little longer.*",249,0.9702148438,Poultry,BushyEyes,1702228101000,https://i.redd.it/83o0uony1i5c1.jpg,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18f845w/chicken_and_yellow_split_pea_stew/,Pea and ham hock soup,292.0,3.56,11.0,5.0,4.0,23.0,26.0,5.0,0.9

Prep Time: 10 minutes

Cook Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

Servings: 4

Calories: 413

**Ingredients**

* 3 pounds bone-in chicken
* 8 cups water more as needed
* 1 head garlic halved crosswise
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 yellow onion peeled and thinly sliced
* 2 jalapeños trimmed and sliced into rounds
* 1 large bunch cilantro roughly chopped, a pinch reserved for garnish
* 10 scallions trimmed and minced, a pinch reserved for garnish
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

**Boil the Chicken:**

* Place the chicken into a large soup pot and cover with 6-8 cups of water. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Add the halved garlic head and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes until chicken is completely cooked through and falling off the bone. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl to cool. Remove the garlic and transfer to a plate to cool.
* Bring the broth back to a boil for 15 minutes until it reduces down a bit. (Note: you can skip this step, but I like a very rich, reduced broth).
* Strain the broth into a bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.
* Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat and discard the skin and carcass.
* Pop the garlic cloves out of the paper and discard the paper. With a fork, mash the cloves into a paste and set aside.

**Prepare the Chicken Verde Soup:**

* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the sliced yellow onion and cook for 5 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic paste and cook for 45 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.
* Pour in reserved chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the cilantro, scallions, jalapeño, and shredded chicken. Reduce heat and cook for 15 minutes or until the onion is very soft and the broth is aromatic. Taste and season to your preferences. Add more water if needed. Turn off the heat.

**To Serve**

* Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the reserved cilantro, scallions and avocado. Squeeze lime juice over each bowl. Enjoy!

**Meatballs:**

* ¼ cup heavy cream
* 1 egg
* ½ cup panko, plus more as needed
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* Big pinch of crushed red pepper
* ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
* 1 pound ground turkey
* Salt and pepper
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, for frying; plus more if needed

**Sauce:**

* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* ½ cup sun-dried tomatoes, drained and chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* Crushed red pepper, to taste
* ½ cup water or chicken broth
* 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
* Pinch of sugar
* 15 basil leaves, torn; plus more for serving
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Cooked pasta

**Make the meatballs:**

1. In a bowl, whisk together the cream and egg until smooth.
2. Add ½ cup panko, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, a big pinch of crushed red pepper, and the Parmesan cheese. Mix until combined and add a pinch of salt and pepper.
3. Add the turkey to the bowl and season with salt and pepper. Use your hands to mix until combined, adding more panko as needed. The mixture should hold together but still be moist and not too firm.
4. Heat the olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add a tiny drop of the meatball mixture and fry until cooked through. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Reduce the heat on the pot to low while you roll the meatballs.
5. Roll the mixture into 2-inch balls; you should have about 12 meatballs. If you prefer smaller meatballs, roll them into tablespoon-sized balls, and you should have about 20 meatballs.

**Fry the meatballs:**

1. Return the heat on the pot to medium. Add the meatballs in an even layer and cook without moving for 3–4 minutes per side until browned all over. Depending on the size of your pot, you may need to cook them in batches. Transfer the meatballs to a plate. They need not be cooked through at this stage.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. If the pot is dry, add another teaspoon or two of oil and turn the heat to medium heat. Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and diced onion and cook for 10 minutes until softened. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.
2. Pour in the water or broth and scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and add the tomatoes and salt and a pinch of sugar. Bring the tomatoes to a boil and add the meatballs. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
3. Remove the lid and check the temperature of the meatballs. Once they reach 165ºF, transfer them to a plate and scatter 5 fresh basil leaves on top of the meatballs along with a pinch more Parmesan cheese.

**Finish the sauce:**

1. Tear the remaining basil leaves and add them to the sauce with the cooked pasta and toss to coat. Taste and season.

**To serve:**

1. Serve the sauced pasta at the table with the platter of turkey meatballs.

I use green bell pepper in this ragù because I like the sharper flavor it adds in contrast to the sun-dried tomatoes. If you prefer sweeter peppers, use red or orange bell peppers, or try it with one green and one red bell pepper for a mix. If you’re not a fan of ground turkey, make this with pork or beef instead.

Cook time: 55 minutes | Serves: 5

* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 pound ground turkey
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and small-diced
* 1 green bell pepper, trimmed, seeded, and small-diced
* ¼ cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, chopped
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, divided; plus more to taste
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* Crushed red pepper, to taste
* ¼ cup water
* 14.5-ounce can fire-roasted crushed tomatoes
* ½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, divided
* 16 ounces mezzi rigatoni or another tubular pasta of choice
* Fresh basil leaves, for serving

**Cook the turkey:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the turkey and season all over with salt, pepper, and half the Italian seasoning. Cook for 12–15 minutes, breaking it up as it cooks, until well-browned and cooked through. Add more salt, if needed.
2. Transfer the cooked turkey to a bowl.

**Cook the aromatics:**

1. If the pot is dry, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and turn the heat back to medium. Add the diced onion, bell pepper, and sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 5–7 minutes until the onion and peppers soften. Season with salt.
2. Melt the butter into the pot and add the remaining Italian seasoning along with the garlic powder, paprika, and crushed red pepper to taste. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the ragù:**

1. Return the turkey to the pot and cook for 1–2 minutes.
2. Pour in the water and crushed tomatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes until thickened. Taste and add more salt or Italian seasoning if needed. Stir the ragù occasionally to prevent it from sticking.

I based this recipe off my duck egg roll recipe which I've made several times now, and it's always a huge hit. I made a few modifications to the filling based on ingredients I had readily available, but the filling is fantastic, with or without mushrooms.

You can also use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store - just make sure you finely chop it.

**Roast duck:**

* 4–5 pound duck; giblets, neck, and feet reserved for another use
* 1 orange, quartered
* Salt and pepper

**Filling:**

* 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and minced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 3 scallions, trimmed and minced
* 2 Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced
* 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
* 2 tablespoons thin soy sauce
* 1–2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce, optional, to taste
* ½ orange, juiced
* Salt, if needed

**Dumplings:**

* 24–28 dumpling wrappers
* Sliced scallion greens, optional, for garnish
* Water

**Sauce:**

* ⅓ cup black vinegar
* 1–2 teaspoons chili oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds

**Prepare the duck:**

1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF.
2. Line a roasting pan with foil. Place a raised rack in the pan and set aside.
3. Pat the duck dry and season it all over with salt and pepper.
4. Stuff the cavity with the orange wedges. Truss the legs with kitchen twine.

**Roast the duck:**

1. Place the duck on top of the raised rack and transfer it to the oven for 2 hours.
2. Remove the duck from the oven. Using a sharp knife, create a few shallow slits in the skin across the breast and around the thighs. This will allow the fat to fully render. Be careful not to cut the meat too much. You just need 6–8 slits all over the duck, particularly around the fatty area of the legs and breasts.
3. Return the duck to the oven for 1 hour.
4. Remove the duck from the oven and let cool as you prepare the filling.

1. Gather the minced ginger, garlic, scallions, and Thai chili peppers in a bowl. Add the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, orange juice, and sweet chili sauce if you like.

**Shred the duck:**

1. Once the duck is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones. Avoid any meat that feels very sinewy. You can keep as much of the crispy skin as you like for the dumplings, particularly the skin around the breasts, thighs, and legs. I discard the skin on the back of the duck. Reserve the carcass for stock, if you like.
2. Place the meat and skin on a cutting board and finely dice. Transfer to the bowl of aromatics and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Your filling is finished, and you're ready to make dumplings!

**Fold the dumplings:**

1. First, get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation.
2. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the dumpling wrapper.
3. Wet the edges with water and fold the dumpling in half. Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling closed into a half-moon shape.
4. You can crimp and pinch the edges as you seal it, but it takes practice!

**Steam, pan-fry, or deep fry the dumplings:**

1. To steam: fill your steamer pot with water and place the rack on top. Place a liner on top. Bring the water to a boil and arrange the dumplings on top. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and steam for 10 minutes.
2. To pan-fry: Dip the bottoms of the dumplings into the water just to coat the bottom, then dip into a bowl of sesame seeds to evenly coat the bottom. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high. Add the dumplings, sesame seed side down, and cook without moving for 1 minute. Pour in ¼ cup water and cover immediately. Cook for 3–4 minutes. Remove the lid and fry for an additional minute or so.
3. To deep-fry: Heat a few inches of oil in a large pot until the oil reaches 330ºF. Add dumplings in batches and deep-fry for 3–4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

**To serve:**

1. Make the sauce by whisking together the black vinegar, chili oil, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. Place the sauce in a small bowl in the middle of a serving platter. Arrange the dumplings around the sauce and garnish with sliced scallions.

**A quick tip:**

Typically, you need to only boil pearl onions for 2 minutes. I go a little longer to soften them a bit more so I don't have to sauté them quite as long since you're holding the duck. BUT! If you don't mind dirtying another skillet, feel free to start those mushrooms and onions in a separate skillet as you cook the duck.

Seared duck breast:

* 1 duck breast (1 pound)
* Salt and pepper to taste

Mushrooms and pearl onions:

* 8 ounces gold or white pearl onions
* 12 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons reserved duck fat
* 3 sprigs thyme
* 4 garlic cloves peeled and thinly sliced
* 1 tablespoon freshly minced parsley, plus more for garnish
* Salt and pepper to taste

Sweet potato puree:

* 2 sweet potatoes, about 1 pound, peeled and cubed
* 2 tablespoons butter
* ½ cup whole milk plus more, if needed
* 2 tablespoons sour cream
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper flakes or paprika and a pinch of crushed red pepper
* Salt and pepper to taste

Parboil and peel the pearl onions:

1. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the pearl onions (skins on) and boil for 5 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl of ice-cold water using a slotted spoon.
2. Once the onions are cool enough to handle, carefully cut off the root end of the onion with sharp scissors. Pop the onion out from its skin. Continue on until all the onions are peeled. Discard the skins.

Cook the sweet potatoes:

1. Dump out the water from the pot and add the sweet potatoes. Cover with fresh water and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20 minutes until fork-tender.
2. Turn off the heat. Pour the potatoes into a colander and return the pot to the same burner. Allow the potatoes to dry off for 1 minute using the residual heat from the warm burner.
3. Add the butter, milk, sour cream, garlic powder, and pepper flakes to the potatoes.
4. Using an immersion blender, blend until creamy and smooth, adding more milk if needed. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder or pepper flakes. Set aside and keep warm.

Cook the duck:

1. Pat the duck dry breast dry. Using a sharp paring knife, score the skin at an angle in ⅛-inch increments until the skin has been completely scored from edge to edge. Be careful not to pierce or cut into the flesh of the duck.
2. Place the duck, skin-side down, into a skillet. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 7 minutes or until the fat begins to render out. Adjust the heat periodically as it cooks. You want to stay somewhere between medium and medium-low.
3. If your duck breast is unevenly fatty (for example, the ends may have a thicker fat layer than the middle of the breast), use a small cast-iron press or skillet or a metal flipper to press that part of the duck into the skillet to encourage even browning.
4. After 7 minutes, get the heat back to medium or just slightly above. The fat in the skillet may begin bubbling and sputtering a bit more rapidly. Check the skin and continue frying and adjusting the heat until the skin is deep golden brown and crisp. This may take another 6–8 minutes. Just keep adjusting the heat and peeking at the skin.
5. Flip the duck and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until desired internal temperature is met. For medium-rare, cook the duck to about 130ºF at the thickest part of the breast. Note: Do not take the temperature of the duck through the skin. Pierce the flesh in order to get an accurate temperature read. I prefer to cook the duck until it reaches 135ºF.
6. Transfer the duck to a plate and cover it tightly with foil. Set aside to rest as you finish the rest of the recipe.

Fry the mushrooms and onions:

1. Drain all the duck fat into a heat-proof jar through a small sieve. Wipe out the skillet and place it on the stove over medium heat.
2. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes until the mushrooms begin to sweat and take on a bit of color.
3. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved duck fat, pearl onions, and thyme sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes until the pearl onions are fork-tender and golden around the edges.
4. Stir in the minced garlic and fresh parsley and sauté for 1 minute. Turn off the heat.

To serve:

1. Right before serving, remove the foil from the duck and slice it crosswise.
2. Spoon the sweet potatoes into a rimmed plate and pile on the mushrooms and onions. Arrange a few slices of duck on each plate. Garnish with more parsley and Aleppo pepper flakes if you like.

**Cooking Tips for Massaman Curry:**

Use high-quality ingredients - Massaman curry relies on the flavour of the curry paste, so make sure to use a good-quality one.

Toast the spices - Toasting the spices, such as cinnamon, cumin, and coriander, before adding them to the curry will enhance their flavour and aroma.

Brown the meat - If you're using meat, such as beef or chicken, brown it first to seal in the juices and enhance the flavour.

Use coconut cream - Coconut cream is richer and thicker than coconut milk, and it gives the curry a creamy texture and flavour.

Add peanuts - Traditional massaman curry often includes peanuts, which add a crunchy texture and nutty flavour to the dish. You can also use cashews or almonds.

Don't overcook the vegetables - To retain their texture and nutrients, don't overcook the vegetables. Add them towards the end of cooking and cook just until they're tender.

Adjust the seasoning - Taste the curry as you cook it and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may need to add more salt, sugar, or fish sauce to balance the flavours.",3033,0.9799804688,Poultry,mienczaczek,1678472479000,https://i.redd.it/im7yhtuueyma1.jpg,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/11nwlxk/chicken_massaman_curry/,Beef massaman curry,734.0,1.87,46.0,13.0,21.0,38.0,44.0,3.0,0.9

&amp;#x200B;

* 6 scallions, trimmed and rinsed, divided
* 1 cup dry pinto beans or use 2 15-ounce cans pinto beans
* 1 shallot, peeled and sliced
* 4-pound whole or cut-up chicken, giblets reserved for another use

* 2 tablespoons neutral oil
* 3 poblano peppers, trimmed, seeded, and diced
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 1 tablespoon ancho chili powder (or use another tablespoon of chili powder)

* For serving:
* Sour cream
* Minced red onion

**Prepare the scallions:**

1. Slice 2 scallions into thirds; these will simmer with the beans. Mince the remaining four scallions and set them aside.

**Prepare the beans (if using dry beans):**

1. Place the beans, two sliced scallions, and the shallot in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour until mostly tender.

**Prepare the chicken and broth:**

1. Place the chicken, jalapeños, and halved onion in a large pot and cover with water. Add a generous sprinkle of salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
2. Using tongs, carefully remove the bird and transfer it to a large bowl. Let cool.
3. Turn the heat on the broth in the pot to a rapid simmer. Let simmer for 30 minutes or until it reduces to about 8 cups of broth. It will darken in color as it cooks down. Adjust the heat as needed if it reduces too quickly.
4. Strain the broth into a large bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard solids.
5. Carefully wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.
6. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones and shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Reserve or freeze the carcass for stock later if you like.

**Prepare the soup:**

1. Heat 2 tablespoons neutral oil in the pot. Add the diced poblano peppers and diced onion. Sauté for 8-10 minutes. Add the remaining 4 minced scallions, and drained beans. Season generously with chili powder, ancho chili powder, paprika, cumin, and cayenne. Add a sprinkle of salt.
2. Pour in reserved broth and shredded chicken and bring to a boil.

**Simmer the soup:**

1. Stir in the rinsed rice. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes until rice is tender. Add more salt if needed.

**Broth:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and quartered
* 2–3 jalapeños, trimmed and halved
* 1 head of garlic, halved crosswise
* 4 pounds chicken, whole or cut up
* 8–10 cups water
* Salt

**Soup:**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 2 bell peppers, trimmed, seeded, and diced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 1 tablespoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon cayenne powder
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 14.5-ounce can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
* 10-ounce can diced tomatoes and habaneros (optional)
* 15-ounce can black beans, drained
* 15-ounce can red enchilada sauce
* 4 ounces softened cream cheese, optional
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Cilantro, cotija or grated cheese, avocado, lime wedges, minced red onion, or sliced serrano pepper

**Prepare the broth:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil over high heat in a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the onion and jalapeños and cook for 2–3 minutes until they begin to char. Add the garlic, cut side down, for 1 minute until it begins to brown.
2. Place the chicken on top and pour over 8–10 cups of water, enough to completely submerge the chicken. Season with a teaspoon or two of salt. It will cook down and become quite salty, so there is no need to go too heavy with it.
3. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 1 hour. Check the broth occasionally and skim off any foam or scum that floats to the top.
4. After 1 hour, remove the chicken from the pot and transfer it to a bowl.

**Finish the broth and shred the chicken:**

1. Turn the heat to medium or medium-high. You want it hot enough to maintain a rapid simmer but not boil vigorously. Simmer rapidly for 20 minutes.
2. Strain the broth into a large bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard solids.
3. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat from the bones and add it to the bowl of broth.
4. Carefully wipe out the pot with a damp cloth and return the pot to the stovetop.

**Prepare the soup:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil over medium-high heat in the pot. Add the diced onion and peppers and cook, occasionally stirring, for 5–7 minutes. Season lightly with salt.
2. Melt the butter into the onion and peppers. Once bubbly, add the chili powder, cumin, cayenne powder, and paprika. Toss to coat and sizzle the spices in the butter for about 1 minute.
3. Pour in the reserved broth and shredded chicken. Next, pour in the diced tomatoes, black beans, and enchilada sauce cans. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Taste and season to your preferences.

**Finish the soup:**

1. Stir in the softened cream cheese if using. Continue cooking until it’s completely melted into the broth.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with your favorite toppings.

I used a Thai/Chinese shiitake mushroom which are meatier than the more delicate shiitake caps. If using shiitakes with thinner caps, adjust cooking time as needed as they have the propensity to dry out quickly.

* 1 pound ground chicken
* 2 eggs
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled
* 4 Thai chili peppers, trimmed
* 3 scallions, scrubbed and trimmed, divided
* 1 shallot, peeled
* 1 tablespoon lemongrass paste
* ½–¾ cup panko or plain breadcrumbs
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced

* 15-ounce can of full-fat coconut milk
* Salt and pepper to taste
* **For serving:**
* Lime wedges
* Crispy shallots

**Prepare the meatballs:**

1. Combine the chicken and eggs in a large bowl. Season all over with salt.
2. Place the garlic, Thai chili peppers, shallot, and 2 scallions in a food processor and pulse until minced.
3. Add the minced aromatics to the chicken along with lemongrass paste. Use your hands to combine. Add ½ cup panko or breadcrumbs and mix to combine. If the mixture is too wet, add an additional ¼ cup of breadcrumbs. Mix until combined and let stand 10 minutes.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat in a wide pot. Add a teaspoon of the meatball mixture and fry until cooked through. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.

**Fry the meatballs:**

1. Form the mixture into meatballs and fry for 3–4 minutes per side until browned all over. They need not be cooked through. Transfer to a plate.

**Cook the mushrooms and onions:**

1. If the pot seems dry, add another tiny drizzle of oil. Add the onions and mushrooms and cook for 7–8 minutes. Stir the mushrooms regularly and continue cooking until they brown around the edges. Season with salt.

**Sizzle the paste:**

1. Add the green curry paste and let it sizzle in the pot for 30 seconds. Toss to coat the mushrooms and onions in the paste. Pour in the water or broth.

**Simmer the meatballs:**

1. Add the chicken meatballs to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer 25 minutes or until meatballs reach 165ºF. Taste and season the broth to your preferences.

**Finish the broth:**

1. Mince the remaining 1 scallion, keeping the white and green parts separate.
2. Stir the coconut milk and white parts of the scallion into the broth. Simmer 5 minutes.

**To serve:**

1. Ladle the broth over cooked rice noodles. Garnish with the minced scallion greens, lime wedges, and crispy shallots.

This creamy chicken pasta recipe is a rich, comforting creamy chicken pasta with vegetables like Brussels sprouts and roasted red bell peppers.

This creamy chicken pasta recipe can be made in a few different ways:

* Raw split chicken breasts that you turn into a homemade chicken stock
* Leftover shredded chicken from a homemade or store-bought roasted chicken
* Raw, boneless chicken that you simply chop up and sauté until cooked through before starting the sauce

**Want to make some substitutions? Here’s my handy guide:**

* **Raw chicken:** In a pinch for time? Use a storebought rotisserie chicken and storebought stock.
* **Carrots, celery, and onions:** Use any combination of aromatics. If you don’t have celery, use more carrots! You can even add lots of freshly minced garlic or even sliced fennel.
* **Mushrooms:** You can omit them or swap with something else you have in your crisper. Try adding a soup green at the end (like escarole, spinach, or arugula) or you can add some frozen veggies at the end like green beans, corn, or peas!
* **Barley:** Use wild rice, farro, farfalle, egg noodles, or pearl couscous. Cooking time will vary!

I love the variety of spices used in that cuisine, not to mention their health benefits.  
  
From all the South Asian dishes Chicken Tandoori is definitely one of my favourites, especially when served on fragrant rice like Biryani. Enjoy cooking!  
  
The secret of the best Chicken Tandoori is the meat quality and marinating time.  
  
The longer marinating period the better. It gives the meat enough time to absorb all those beautiful flavours!  
  
Remember to always pick the meat from suppliers that do respect animal welfare, if you cannot afford it try to eat less meat but better sourced.  
  
Making cuts in the meat helps the marinade to penetrate deeper, thus giving a better result.

2 large Chicken Breasts

2 Yellow Onions

2 Portobello Mushroom Cups or 6oz of any Mushroom

5 Cloves of Garlic

9oz of Fresh Mozzarella cheese

4 slices of Prosciutto ham

1 cup of Heavy Cream

1/2 cup of White Wine (optional)

Fresh Thyme

[full recipe with pictures here](https://tasteabroad.com/recipe/chicken-roulade-with-mushrooms-in-creamy-sauce/)

1. Prepare chicken breast

Paper dry chicken breast and slice horizontally from the thicker side to a thinner, but stop about 1/2 inches to it. This way you will ""butterfly"" your chicken breast, which is a well-known technique to make thin and large chicken pieces. 

Cover your butterflied chicken breast with a piece of plastic wrap and roll a pin over it to make it even and thinner. Set aside.

2.  Make mushroom stuffing 

Mince 5 cloves of garlic and sauté it in a frying pan over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add finely chopped 2 onions, keep sautéing for another 2 minutes. Add chopped Portobello mushroom caps to the pan and keep cooking stirring occasionally for 5 more minutes or until all water will evaporate from the pan. 

Add a quarter of a cup of dry White Wine, mix well and cook until stuffing gets almost dry. 

At that point add 1 teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, and some fresh minced thyme. Mix well and set aside to cool down.

3. Roll!

Place your chicken with a wide side down and thin side up like on the pictures below. 
Divide mushroom sauce into 3 parts: 2 for each chicken breast and 1 for the cream sauce for later. 

Using a spoon, evenly spread 1 part of mushroom stuffing over the chicken piece, leaving half an inch on each side uncovered. 

Next, lay some thinly sliced fresh mozzarella, keep sides uncovered.

Gently roll chicken working your way from the wider bottom to the thinner top. Do not add too much pressure, as your stuffing will try to escape! We will secure everything in place with a cooking twine in just a second.

Now it is time to wrap our roulade in prosciutto. Here is what I learned the hard way ( meaning one of the roulades on final pictures is an unsuccessful test, but still the same delicious ha!): lay prosciutto slices parallel to your chicken roll, this way it is much easier to cover the whole roulade, which will look so much better when the dish is done!

Twine up! Using a cooking twine (the cotton string will work just fine!) gently wrap your roulade, starting from one side of it with tying a knot and work your way to the other side. Now you can add some pressure to help twine keep roulade`s shape while searing it. 

4. Sear roulade 

Preheat your skillet pan on medium heat. I used skillet mostly because I  wanted to be able to cook my dish both on a stovetop and in the oven, so if you have a suitable frying pan you can stick it into your cooking stove, - use that! Also, I used 2 tablespoons of canola oil to season my pan. 

Add your chicken roulades into a hot pan and sear for 3 minutes on each of 4 sides.  Let it cool down for 5 minutes before proceeding to the final step.

5. Sauce and bake

Gently remove twine by cutting each layer and pulling it.

Finally, pour half a cup of heavy cream into your pan, add a third of the mushroom stuffing left from making roulades, and a little bit more cheese ( at this point you can use any cheese you love but make sure it is great melting one). 

Place pan into the preheated to 370F oven and bake for 20 minutes.

*Serves ~6 people*

*I eyeballed the ingredient amounts but will try and write approximations.*

Ingredients:

* ~2.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs
* ~20 cloves of garlic finely chopped, ground, or minced
* 5-6 stalks worth of basil leaves (use holy basil or regular basil here)
* 1-2 heads of broccoli
* 1 yellow onion
* 1 red bell pepper

* Oyster sauce (~10 tbsp for marinade and another 4 tbsp for stir fry sauce)
* 2 tbsp Hoisin sauce
* 1 tsp Fish sauce
* 1.5 tbsp Light soy sauce
* 1.5 tbsp Dark/sweet soy sauce
* A few pinches of corn starch
* A few pinches of MSG if you have it although I forgot it this time and still tasted great
* 1 tbsp sugar (also optional - the sauces already add some sweetness)

Procedure:

Slice the chicken into strips and then marinate in plenty of oyster sauce for at least 30 min to an hour but the longer the better.  Fry the chicken strips in peanut oil or another good frying oil on medium heat for ~ 5 minutes on each side or until you see the sauce begin to caramelize on the chicken and it's cooked through.  Set your chicken aside and then, if necessary, add a little more oil to the pan and throw in all of your minced garlic.  Turn up the heat here to high and once the garlic starts to brown slightly, throw in all of your chopped-up veggies.  Fry the veggies until you see them start to brown and then turn down the heat to medium-low and throw in all of your sauces along with the chicken.  Throw in the corn starch, MSG, and sugar, give this a good mix, and cook on medium-low for a minute or two.  Finally, kill the heat or turn down to the lowest setting and add in the basil.  Stir the basil around until it gets all saucy and nice.  It's important not to really cook the basil but to let the very low or residual heat and sauce do their work on it while you mix it in.",1950,0.9902343750000001,Poultry,saybrook1,1619764978000,https://i.redd.it/f6zmdgdk09w61.jpg,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/n1ncb8/thai_basil_stir_fry/,Thai beef stir-fry,178.0,0.55,10.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,22.0,0.0,0.8800000000000001

Oftentimes when people think of Vietnamese food, they immediately think of pho or banh mi. Welp, Vietnamese people eat FAR more than just pho or banh mi, and at home, food is oftentimes far simpler and humbler, like this simple preparation of Vietnamese garlicky roast chicken. 

  
Roast chicken has thousands of iterations across cultures, but this is one of my absolute favorites, and it’s sooo simple: it’s got just six ingredients plus the chicken, and after 30 minutes roasting in the oven, you’ve got a lip-smackingly luscious bird that will beg to have its juices sopped up with some rice!

  
To watch my video on how to make this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90)  
**Viet Garlicky Roast Chicken Recipe (adapted from Andrea Nguyen)** 

  
1 whole 3.5-4 lb chicken, preferably organic and air-chilled, spatchcocked (back bone removed with bird splayed flat), OR 3.5-4 lb chicken parts (thighs, drumsticks, and wings) 

  
*Marinade ingredients:*

* 4 whole garlic cloves, minced finely 
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1.5 tsp sugar
* 1/4 tsp kosher salt
* 1.5 Tbsp neutral oil
* 3.5 Tbsp Maggi seasoning 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Combine all sauce ingredients into a bowl and mix well. 
2. Prepare the chicken: take the chicken (or chicken parts), and using a chopstick or skewer, carefully separate the skin from the meat all over. Then, add the marinade sauce all over the chicken with your hands, making sure to get the sauce between the meat and the skin. 
3. Refrigerate the chicken and allow to marinade for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor penetration. 
4. The next day, preheat oven to 500 F. Place spatchcocked chicken on a cast iron roasting pan or roasting tray. Place chicken in the oven and roast for about 30 minutes, checking about 5-10 min in to ensure the chicken isn’t browning too quickly. If it is, tent the darker parts with foil and lower heat to 450 F. If using parts, roast time may be closer to 40-45 min. 
5. After about 30 minutes, remove chicken from the oven. Check doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer - thighs should register about 165 F when done. 
6. Once the chicken is done, allow to rest for 15 min to ensure optimal juiciness level. Then, cut and serve with rice and enjoy. ",1932,0.9902343750000001,Poultry,yvonnemeetsfood,1606666379000,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/k3by3g,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/k3by3g/simple_vietnamese_garlicky_roast_chicken/,Thai green curry roast chicken,721.0,1.2,49.0,3.0,23.0,5.0,64.0,1.0,0.8400000000000001

Prep Time: 20 minutes

Servings: 6

Calories: 483kcal

**Ingredients**

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil for frying
* 3 pounds chuck or rump roast cut into bite-sized cubes
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 yellow onions peeled and cut into thin wedges
* 5-6 cups low-sodium beef stock
* 1 teaspoon dry thyme or 4 sprigs fresh thyme
* 1 head of garlic halved crosswise, do not remove the garlic skin; the head should remain intact
* 1 red Fresno pepper halved lengthwise, seeds removed, if desired
* 1 large blood orange or navel orange halved
* 1 pound young carrots tops removed and peeled; halved if the carrots are large
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Crushed red pepper to taste

**For Serving:**

* Mashed potatoes crusty bread, noodles, rice, or roasted potatoes
* Parsley for garnish

**Brown the Beef:**

1. Preheat oven to 300ºF. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Pat the beef dry and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook in batches in an even layer until very well-browned, about 4-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

**Cook the Aromatics:**

1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the onions. Cook, stirring regularly, for 4-5 minutes until softened. Add 1 cup of the beef stock and scrape up all the browned bits stuck to bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and stir occasionally for 4-5 minutes until reduced slightly.
2. Return the beef back to the pot and reduce heat to low. Add the remaining beef stock.
3. Add the thyme, garlic halves (cut-side up) and the red Fresno pepper. Squeeze the juice from both orange halves over the beef and add the orange halves to the pot. Taste and season lightly with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Turn the heat off and cover the pot. Transfer to the oven for 2-3 hours until the beef is very tender.

**Cook the Carrots:**

1. Return the pot to the stove over medium heat. Remove and discard the orange and chili pepper. Remove the garlic from the pot. Once cool enough to handle, pop the cloves from the paper and mash them into a paste. Work the garlic paste back into the broth. Taste and season the broth to your preferences. Add the carrots and cook, covered, for 15-30 minutes on low heat until tender. Remove the cover and cook for 5-10 minutes over medium heat to allow the sauce in the pan to thicken.
2. If needed, add a splash or two of water. If a thicker gravy is desired, add a flour slurry to the pan and whisk it in and allow it took for an additional 5-10 minutes to thicken.

**To Serve:**

1. Ladle the beef stew over mashed potatoes or your accompaniment of choice. Garnish with parsley, if desired. Enjoy!

* 3 cups mixed vegetables, such as broccoli florets, shredded or small-diced carrots, snow peas, sliced bell peppers, or shredded cabbage
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil, plus more as needed
* Salt to taste

**Aromatics:**

* 1 small shallot, peeled and minced
* 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2 teaspoons minced ginger
* 1 Thai chili, trimmed and minced; optional or use a pinch of crushed red pepper
* 2 scallions, trimmed and minced

**Sauce:**

* ⅔ cup water or beef stock
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch or sweet potato starch
* 1½ tablespoons brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon light soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil

**For serving:**

* Cooked white rice or cooked noodles
* Sesame seeds
* Minced scallion greens

**Marinate the beef:**

1. Whisk together the cornstarch, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, minced ginger, white pepper, and sesame oil in a bowl. Whisk until no lumps remain, and add the beef. Toss to coat and transfer to the refrigerator for 15–20 minutes.

**Prepare the aromatics and vegetables:**

1. As the beef marinates, prepare all vegetables and aromatics. Keep the mushrooms in one bowl, the mixed vegetables in a separate bowl, and the aromatics in another bowl.

**Prepare the sauce:**

1. Whisk together the sauce ingredients in a small bowl until no lumps remain. Set aside.

**Cook the vegetables:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook for 8–10 minutes until golden brown. Season with a sprinkle of salt and transfer back to their bowl.
2. If the skillet is dry, add another drizzle of neutral oil over medium-high heat. Add the mixed vegetables and spread them into an even layer. Cook, turning occasionally, for 4–5 minutes.
3. Add the aromatics to the skillet with the vegetables and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. At this point, the vegetables should be tender-crisp. Remove them from the skillet and transfer them back to their bowl.

**Fry the beef:**

1. Add 1 tablespoon of neutral oil to the skillet. Turn the heat to medium-high. Once hot, add the beef and cook for 3–5 minutes until just barely cooked through. Turn the beef once or twice as it cooks.

**Finish the stir-fry:**

1. Pour the sauce over the beef and scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the skillet. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 2–3 minutes or until the beef is cooked and the sauce is thick.
2. Add the cooked mushrooms and cooked mixed vegetables. Toss to coat and cook for 1–2 minutes more. Turn off the heat.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the stir-fry over cooked rice or noodles. Garnish with sesame seeds and minced scallions. Enjoy!

**Beef:**

* ¼ cup flour
* 2 pounds beef stew cubes
* 2 teaspoons black pepper (freshly cracked, preferably)
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 1–2 tablespoons neutral oil, for frying

**Beef stew:**

* 8 ounces mushrooms, trimmed and sliced
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil, if needed
* 1 large yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 3 ribs celery, trimmed and sliced on a bias
* 4 carrots, peeled and sliced into rounds on a bias
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 heaping teaspoon dry thyme
* ¼ cup flour
* 4 cups of water or beef stock plus 1–2 cups more
* 1 cup frozen peas
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Brown butter noodles:**

* 16 ounces wide egg noodles
* 5 tablespoons butter, cut into evenly-sized pieces
* ⅓ cup loosely packed fresh parsley, minced
* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prepare the beef:**

1. Add the flour, black pepper, salt, and paprika to a large bowl and stir to combine.
2. Blot off any excess liquid from the beef. Add it to the bowl with the flour and toss to coat.

**Brown the beef:**

1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the beef in an even layer. Do not overcrowd the pot; you will likely need to brown the beef in batches. Cook for 3–5 minutes on each side until browned all over. Transfer to a large bowl and keep the pot on medium-high heat. Add more oil, as needed, while browning the beef.

**Cook the mushrooms:**

1. Add the sliced mushrooms to the pot. Cook, turning occasionally, for 7–8 minutes until lightly browned. Continue cooking for an additional 2–3 minutes until deep golden brown. Season lightly with salt and transfer to the bowl with the beef.

**Sauté the mirepoix:**

1. If the pot is dry, add another drizzle of neutral oil. Turn the heat to medium and add the onion, celery, and carrots. Season all over with salt and pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, for 7–8 minutes until the onions are translucent and the carrots begin to brown around the edges.
2. Melt the butter in the pot and add the garlic and thyme. Toss to coat and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Simmer the stew:**

1. Sprinkle the flour over the aromatics and toss to coat. Cook for 1–2 minutes until nutty and aromatic. Add ½ cup of the water or beef stock and whisk to form a slurry. Continue adding the liquid, in ½-cup increments until all 4 cups of liquid have been incorporated. 
2. Return the beef and mushrooms to the pot. Add the remaining 1–2 cups liquid if needed to ensure the beef is completely submerged with liquid. Taste and season the broth with more salt and pepper, if needed. *Note: You may need to add more liquid as the beef cooks. You can use additional beef stock or continue adding water if the broth of the stew evaporates too quickly.*
3. Reduce the heat on the beef stew to low. Cover and simmer and 1½ hours. Check the stew occasionally and add more liquid as needed.

**Finish the stew:**

1. Uncover the stew and simmer for an additional 15–20 minutes, uncovered. Taste and season once more to your preferences.
2. Add the frozen peas and cook for 5 minutes until warmed through and bright green. Turn off the heat.

**Prepare the noodles:**

1. As the stew finishes simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

**Ingredients for Beef Quesadilla:**

\* 400g (14.1oz) of the diced beef shin (or other cuts high in connective tissue)

\* 150g (5.3oz) Oaxaca cheese or substitute with mozzarella

\* 200g (7oz) sweet bell peppers, seeds removed and sliced

\* 1 medium onion roughly chopped

\* 2 garlic cloves minced

\* 1tsp mild chilli powder

\* 1tsp ground cumin

\* 1tsp cumin seeds

\* 1tsp dried or fresh oregano

\* 2tsp paprika

\* 1tbsp of chipotle paste

\* 500ml (0.52quarts) of beef or vegetable stock

\* 5g (0.17oz) chopped parsley

\* 1tsp of salt

\* 4 medium-size wraps (20cm (8inch) diameter)

\* vegetable oil

&amp;#x200B;

**How to prepare Beef Quesadilla:**

**1.** Marinate the beef in cumin, paprika, chili powder, marjoram, garlic, and 2 tablespoons of oil. You can marinate the beef the day before or at least 30 minutes before cooking.

**2.** Fry the meat with onions on high heat to colour and transfer to the slow cooker (you can use a pot or leave it in the same pan as well) add stock to cover the meat and add one tsp of salt. Set the slow cooker on high setting for 3-4 hours (for overnight cooking, keep the beef in larger pieces and set on low setting)

**3.** While the beef is cooking, fry the sweet peppers on medium heat for about 10 minutes, and set them aside for later.

**4.** When the beef is tender, remove it from the slow cooker, and let it cool for a few minutes in the cooking juices. Then, remove it from the liquid, and shred it with your fingers. Mix the shredded beef with the fried sweet peppers, chopped parsley, tomato paste, chipotle paste and some of the meat cooking juices.

**5.** Brush one side of the tortilla with olive oil and place it on a heated frying pan. Add cheese to one side and top with the shredded beef mixture. Once the tortilla is golden-brown, fold it over and flatten slightly.

**6.** Remove the quesadilla from the pan and cut it in half before serving. Enjoy with your favourite Mexican toppings! Enjoy!

**Beef:**

* 1 tablespoon lemongrass paste
* 2 teaspoons minced ginger
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 4 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 1 red Fresno chili pepper, trimmed and minced, or use a serrano pepper
* 1 teaspoon chili oil
* 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
* 2 teaspoons cornstarch or sweet potato starch
* 16 ounces skirt steak or flank steak

**Stir-fry:**

* 3 tablespoons neutral oil, divided
* 1 yellow onion, peeled and halved lengthwise and thinly sliced into wedges
* 8 ounces snow peas, tough string removed from both sides of the snow peas
* 1 red bell pepper, trimmed, seeded, and sliced into strips
* 1 teaspoon minced ginger
* ¼ cup water
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Cooked white rice
* Fresh cilantro or minced scallions
* Lime wedges
* Crispy shallots

**Make the rice:**

* Before beginning, I recommend making a pot of rice first. Then, keep it warm as you prepare the stir-fry.

**Prepare the marinade:**

* Gather all of the ingredients for the marinade except the cornstarch and beef in a large bowl. Stir until completely combined. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add the cornstarch and stir until smooth. Set aside.
* Pat the beef dry and cut (with the grain) into 4-inch long pieces to make it easier to slice into strips. Next, cut the resulting beef pieces against the grain into ½-inch wide strips. Cutting against the grain will yield the most tender beef, so be mindful of how you slice!
* Add the beef to the bowl of marinade and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator for 15–30 minutes.

**Cook the vegetables:**

* Heat half the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the onion, snow peas, and red bell pepper. Cook in batches if needed. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the pepper begins to char and the snow peas are bright green and tender, about 5–7 minutes. Stir in the ginger and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.
* Remove the vegetables from the skillet and transfer to a bowl.

**Cook the beef:** 

* Add the remaining oil to the skillet over medium-high heat.  Once hot, pour in the beef with all of the marinade. A splatter screen will help with the sputtering! Spread the beef into an even layer. Cook for 3–4 minutes until the beef begins to brown and the marinade is bubbling.
* Crank the heat during the first 3 minutes and watch it closely to develop a sear on the beef without burning the marinade. Then, adjust the heat back to medium-high. It will look like the sauce separates as it cooks, but don’t worry!
* After 3–4 minutes, flip the beef and continue cooking, often turning, for 2–4 minutes or until the beef is mostly cooked through.
* Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and stir to develop a thick sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings. Turn off the heat and stir in the vegetables. Toss to coat.

**To serve:**

* Arrange the cooked white rice on a serving platter and pile the stir-fried beef and vegetables on top. Garnish with cilantro, scallions, lime wedges, and crispy shallots.

* 2 eggs
* 8 ounces ricotta cheese
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 1 cup Italian-seasoned panko, more if needed
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder or a roasted garlic spice blend
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper, more to taste

* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1/2 cup red wine or use beef stock
* 32 oz crushed tomatoes
* 2 sprigs fresh basil
* Salt, pepper, and sugar if needed.

**Prepare the meatballs:**

* Whisk the eggs, ricotta cheese, and heavy cream in a large bowl until smooth. Add the panko and mix until smooth. Let stand for 10 minutes.
* Add the garlic powder, crushed red pepper, shallots, and beef. Season all over with salt and pepper. Mix with your hands until well-combined. Fry or microwave a small pinch of the mixture so you can taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.
* Form the meatballs into tablespoon-sized balls and set aside.
* Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the meatballs in an even layer, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Cook in batches for 3–5 minutes per side until browned all over. It’s ok if they aren’t cooked through! Transfer all of the meatballs to a plate and set aside.
* Drain off excess fat but leave any browned fond stuck to the bottom as you’ll deglaze it with wine later.

**Cook the sauce:**

* Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot and turn the heat to medium. Once hot, add the yellow onion and cook, stirring often, for 5–7 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the tomato paste and mash it into the onion as it cooks. Sizzle the paste for at least 4–5 minutes until it deepens in color and begins to stick to the bottom of the pot.
* Add the red wine and bring to a boil. Stir constantly to lift any of the browned fond from the bottom of the pot.
* Add the crushed tomatoes and bring to a low boil. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and sugar if needed.
* Add the cooked meatballs to the sauce along with the basil sprigs. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for least 45 minutes until completely cooked through.

**Enjoy the recipe and the** [**latest episode of United Cuisines on Youtube!**](https://youtu.be/q6m5z7uF-so)

*INGREDIENTS*

* stewing beef (e.g. shin or chuck) \[1 lb / 450 g\]
* butter \[1 tbsp / 20 g\]
* onion \[1 large / 170 g\]
* caraway seeds \[1 tsp / 2 g\]
* Hungarian sweet paprika \[1.25 tbsp / 10 g\]
* beef broth \[2 cups / 500 ml\]
* diced canned tomatoes \[1 cup / 250 g\]
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 bay leaf
* vegetables of your choice (e.g. bell pepper, potatoes, carrots)

*METHOD*

1. Detach the meat from the bone (if you're using shin) and cut it into small cubes of around one inch, or 2 cm. Leave the fat and tissue on
2. Cut the onion into small cubes, the washed vegetables of choice into bite size pieces
3. Sprinkle some vegetable oil into a stainless pan and sear the meat over high heat. **Salt the meat right before frying** and don’t overcrowd the pan. Sear from two sides till nicely browned and fond starts building up on the pan’s surface. Transfer the browned meat into a big enough pot, in which you will cook the Goulash, set aside
4. Reduce the heat of the pan to medium, add the butter and sauté the onions for a few minutes
5. Coarsely ground the caraway seeds in a mortar &amp; pestle ground, make some space in the pan and dry fry (""wake them up""), together with the sweet paprika. They should turn fragrant after a minute or so
6. Combine with the onions and deglaze with a little bit a of beef broth
7. Scrape the good stuff off the bottom of the pan and mix well before transferring everything into the pot. Add the remainder of the broth, cubed tomatoes, carrots, a bay leaf and crush in the garlic. Put on the lid, reduce the heat to low and let simmer for around 75-90 minutes, occasionally stirring every 15 minutes or so
8. Add potatoes and peppers around 20 minutes before the meat is expected to get tender, which, depending on the cut, might take up to 3 hours. So best ask you butcher here
9. Top up with some hot water, if necessary, cover and let cook till the potatoes are done and the meat is fork tender
10. Season with salt and pepper to taste, turn off the heat and let sit for a few minutes before serving
11. Enjoy!

I make kind of quick and dirty mashed potatoes for this. If you like richer potatoes, feel free to add butter or use heavy cream if you like.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 pound pork tenderloin
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, plus more
* 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed and quartered; peel the potatoes if preferred
* 1 leek, white part only, scrubbed and thinly sliced
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* ½ red cabbage, cored and roughly chopped
* 1 tablespoon whole grain mustard
* 1 tablespoon honey
* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
* ½ cup water
* ¼ cup whole milk, plus more if needed
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* ½ teaspoon paprika
* Pinch of white pepper
* Pinch of crushed red pepper
* 2 teaspoons freshly chopped dill, optional
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the pork tenderloin:**

1. Preheat oven to 425ºF.
2. Pat the pork tenderloin dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in an oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the pork tenderloin and cook for 4–5 minutes per side until browned all over. Transfer to a plate.

**Prepare the potatoes:**

1. While the pork fries, place the potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 20–25 minutes or until fork tender. Scoop out ¼ cup of the potato water, drain the potatoes, and return them to the pot. Keep warm.

**Cook the aromatics:**

1. Heat another teaspoon or two of olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.

**Sauté the cabbage:**

1. Add the chopped cabbage to the leeks and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Cook for 5–7 minutes.

**Ingredients**

* 1 cup low-sodium chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard
* 1 heaping tablespoon dark brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon cooking oil
* 4 thick bone-in pork chops
* 4 firm bosc or red d’anjou pears trimmed, cored, seeds removed, and cut into wedges
* 2 shallots peeled and cut into wedges
* 8 ounces fresh baby spinach
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prepare sauce:**

1. In a bowl, prepare the sauce by whisking together the chicken stock, mustard, and brown sugar.
2. Fry the pork chops: Preheat oven to 400ºF. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the pork chops and cook without moving for 5 minutes until well browned. Flip and cook an additional 5 minutes until golden brown. Do not overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if needed. Transfer the pork chops to a plate.

**Ingredients:**

* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced
* 4 tablespoons butter, divided
* 5 scallions, minced; white and green parts kept separate
* 1 cup carnaroli or arborio rice
* 6 cups warm water or chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 pound broccoli, cut into florets
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
* ¾ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
* ½ lemon, juiced
* 4 boneless, thick-sliced center-cut pork chops (1 pound total)
* Freshly minced parsley, optional, for serving
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the risotto:**

1. Preheat the oven to 425ºF.
2. Turn the heat on a large pot to medium. Add the mushrooms and cook, occasionally turning as they release water. The water will evaporate over 8–10 minutes. Once the water from the mushrooms evaporates, turn the heat to medium-high and add 2 tablespoons of butter. Cook for 4-5 minutes until they brown and crisp up around the edges. Add salt and pepper.
3. Add the scallion whites to the mushrooms. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the carnaroli rice and cook for 1–2 minutes. Add a pinch of salt. *\*See Note*
4. Begin ladling in the warm water or stock, 1 cup at a time. Stir after each addition and only add more liquid once the rice absorbs the liquid in the pot. Continue adding the liquid until 5 cups have been incorporated. Taste the risotto to see if the rice is tender. The liquid in the pot should be creamy. Add the remaining 1 cup of water only if needed and stir after adding it. Taste and add salt and pepper. This process will take 20–25 minutes.
5. Once the rice is tender, turn off the heat. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, half of the minced scallion greens, and the Parmesan cheese until melted. Add the lemon juice. Taste and season once more.

**Roast the broccoli:**

1. Arrange the broccoli florets on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.
2. As soon as you add the carnaroli rice to the pot for the risotto, transfer the broccoli to the oven. Roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover with foil. Keep warm and keep the oven heated to 425ºF.

**Cook the pork chops:**

1. Pat the pork chops dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops and cook for 3–4 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven for 15–17 minutes. Once the pork chops reach 140ºF, remove them from the oven and rest on a cutting board for 5–10 minutes.
3. Slice the pork chops thinly and arrange on a serving platter with the roasted broccoli.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the risotto into shallow bowls. Arrange the sliced pork chop on top and serve with the broccoli on the side. Garnish with freshly minced parsley and the remaining minced scallion greens. Enjoy!

Notes:

Continue with roasting the broccoli and the pork chops as you cook the risotto. While you should stir the risotto regularly, you can take breaks periodically to roast the broccoli and fry up the pork chops.

**Pork chops and braised red cabbage:**

* ½ pound thick sliced bacon, cut into lardons
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 4 thick-cut, bone-in pork chops
* 1 pound head of red cabbage, cored and chopped
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
* 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard
* 1 orange, juiced
* ½ cup water
* Salt and pepper

* ⅓ cup water, plus more if needed

**For serving:**

* Roasted or mashed potatoes

**Preheat oven to 350ªF.**

Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low and simmer for 30–45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the relish becomes jammy and sticky. Add more water as needed to loosen up the relish as needed. Taste and season once more.

**Cook the bacon:**

1. Place the diced bacon in a wide pot over medium heat. Cook, turning often until the fat completely renders from the bacon and the bacon crisps up. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour all but 1 tablespoon of rendered bacon fat into a heat-proof glass.

(Optional: You can slowly add in more cornstarch if you want your sauce thicker


6. Keep your ribs warm in the oven while your sauce thickens. Then when ready remove from oven and carefully remove bones as to not break apart the meat. Then cut ribs into square bite size pieces and add back to pot with sauce.

Recipe lightly modified from here: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/scotcheggs\_85851](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/scotcheggs_85851)

**Ingredients:**

For the sausage meat:

\- 1lb lean minced pork

\- 20g Stuffing Mix (Bland as possible so American style preferably. I used Stove Top pork)- Freshly ground Pepper

\- 2 tsp fresh thyme

\- 1 tsp parsley flakes

\- 1 tsp sage

\- 2 small shallots, very finely chopped

&amp;#x200B;

For the scotch eggs:

\- 6 medium eggs

\- 80g plain flower, seasoned with salt and pepper

\- 1 egg beaten

\- 3 slices of white bread, lightly toasted then ground into breadcrumbs

\- vegetable oil, for frying

&amp;#x200B;

**Method**

\- Combine all the ingredients for the sausage meat together in a medium bowl, mix thoroughly. Meat can be covered and stored in fridge for later use.

\- Place the eggs, unbroken, in cold salted water. Bring to the boil then immediately reduce tempreature and simmer for 9 min. (You may have to do this in stages, if so you only need to let the water cool to warm between batches)

\- When the eggs are finished strain and cool under running water. Then peel off the shells, if you haven't done this before I recommend looking up a video, fingernails help.

\- Take the sausage meet and divide into sixths on a clean cutting board, before flattening each into a shallow oval \~1/4"" thick.

\- Spread the seasoned flower onto a large plate. One at a time take a peeled egg and dredge it in flower until a thin coating sticks to all surfaces, before placing the egg at the center of the flattened sausage meat, and wrapping the meat around it and gently rolling to form a smooth egg shaped ball.

\- Prepare the breadcrumbs, I used a stick blender and a tall cup to get them fine enough. Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate. One at a time coat the meat wrapped eggs in the beaten egg mixture before rolling in bread crumbs enough to ensure a even coating on all surfaces.

\- With all the eggs prepared select a high walled pot and fill with oil, quantity will vary based on pot selection but ideally should be enough to completely submerge the prepared egg. **Important:** Do not fill the pot anywhere near to full, remember when you place eggs in the oil level will rise and we do not want it to boil over. Heat the oil until a loose breadcrumb placed in it will bubble and brown in around 30s. (I found this was around 370F)

\- The eggs will be cooked for \~9 min in the hot oil. I suggest using a slotted spoon to place and remove them. I encourage you to monitor the oil tempreature yourself, either by thermometer or look and feel and suggest you open up the first egg cooked and determine if any adjustments need to be made. It will all be relative to your setup but I cooked the eggs two at a time on alternating cycles, one egg removed every four and a half minutes, my oil temperature remained fairly constant at \~320F, and I rotated the eggs twice to ensure even cooking.

\- **Important:** Usual safety precautions when working with hot oil apply, always use long implements to place eggs into the oil preferably from the side of the pot. Be aware of the temperament of the oil, sizzling is good bubbling is worrying. Be aware of the level of the oil as you add and remove the eggs. Finally as I was working in a small pot I took the step of turning off the gas every time I added a egg to prevent risk of flare up if the oil overflowed.

\- When the eggs are finished place them on a sheet of kitchen roll to absorb excess oil. Personal preference is to serve chilled or at room temperature, though they can be eaten warm after allowing some time to cool.  


  
**Improvements**  
This is probably the simplest least creative recipe for scotch eggs out there, I was deliberately aiming for generic. It does however make it completely open to adaptation/improvement. If I were to make it again I would definitely attempt to address the slightly bland breadcrumbs, I suspect the answer may be more salt but I also want to see if some herbs (perhaps sage) add some complexity to the flavor.",1874,0.9599609375,Pork,EminusVulneratis,1633417037000,https://i.redd.it/ziwqu8xymkr71.jpg,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/q1olns/scotch_eggs/,Scotch eggs,590.0,2.49,41.0,2.0,12.0,27.0,30.0,1.0,0.9

Pork meat is prepared by marinating in a unique spice blend called Red Recado and slow-cooked in fruit juices over a period of 21 hours. The meat is then mixed with the cooking juices, served on a corn tortilla with red onion pickle. Taco is garnished with cilantro or parsley. Sometimes salsa or guacamole is also served as a topping but it is a personal preference.

At home, I used a slow-cooker on a low setting. 8 pm start for the overnight cook, meat was ready lunchtime on the following day. The only side effect of this method of cooking is sleepless night as the delicious aromas keep you awake...

## What kind of meat is used for Cochinita Pibil Tacos?

Traditionally, hairless Mexican pig is used for Cochinitas. For the top-quality meat, pigs are raised in an organic setting, fed with a variety of fruit, grass, grains and vegetables. Papaya is their most beloved feed on the menu giving the pork a unique flavour. Almost all parts of the animal are used for recipe ranging from ears, cheeks, main body to offal.

To prepare Cochinitas at home I choose Pork shoulder as my preference. Next time I will definitely try ribs or belly.

Remember to choose the best quality meat from sources that respect animal life and consumers health!

## What is a Red Recado Spice blend?

The main ingredient of Red Recado is an Annatto that comes from the Achiote tree native to the tropical region of Mexico and Brazil. Their aroma is very unique reminding Roses with a hint of nutmeg and pepper. The whole Annatto seeds can be purchased online and ground at home.

**Ingredients for Red Recado:**

* 3tbsp of ground Annatto seeds
* 1tsp of allspice
* 1tsp of cloves
* 1tsp black peppercorns
* 0,5tsp cinnamon

* 1tbsp oregano
* 2tsp of salt
* 6 garlic cloves
* hot chilli peppers (traditionally tabasco are used, I used 4 birds eye chillis from my home garden)

**Ingredients for slow-cooked meat:**

* 1,5kg (3.3 Pounds) pork shoulder cut into 4 (ribs, belly plus any other part that you like can be used as well)
* 500ml of fruit juice (2 grapefruits, 3limes, 4 oranges) use 100ml for the pickled onion

Someone told me about Chrissy Teigan’s Thai pork stuffed cucumber soup and I knew I wanted to try making my own version of it. 

The woman who posted it to our group shared Chrissy Teigan's recipe and she said she felt like the version she ate growing up had more cilantro or spices in it. I did a little hunting and found a version on Cookpad by Kanya from Thailand which uses LOTS of cilantro. Kanya's version uses tofu, which I didn’t have, so I omitted that.

Obviously, both versions are probably equally tasty, but I was definitely intrigued by the white pepper in the pork from Kanya's recipe, so that's what I used as my starting point.

This is a really easy recipe and a unique take on a really cheap veggie that most of us are probably swimming in this time of year!

# SUBSTITUTIONS:

Ground Pork: Ground chicken or ground turkey

Cucumber: Seedless or seeded, doesn't matter

Ground White Pepper: Use black pepper instead – it won't have exactly the same flavor, but it's ok.

You can follow Kanya's method and add tofu to it, as well!

**Frizzled leeks:**

* 1 leek, white and light green parts only, scrubbed and rinsed
* Vegetable oil

**Guanciale chili oil:**

* 4 ounces guanciale, bacon, or pancetta; small-diced
* 1 small shallot, peeled and finely diced
* 1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more to taste
* ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
* ¼ cup chili oil
* 1–2 teaspoons maple syrup
* Pinch of salt, if needed

**Saffron cod and orzo:**

* Pinch of saffron, lightly crushed
* 2 tablespoons hot water
* 6 4-ounce portions of cod
* 1 fennel bulb with stalks; bulb cored and thinly sliced, stalks trimmed and thinly sliced into rounds, fronds reserved for garnish
* 1 shallot, peeled and sliced lengthwise into thin wedges
* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 16 ounces orzo
* 5½ cups water or vegetable broth
* 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 lemon, juiced
* ¼ cup loosely packed parsley, minced
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Prep the leek:**

1. Before beginning, prepare the leek as it takes the most time. Halve the leek lengthwise and very thinly slice both halves into 1/8-inch wide slivers. You may need to separate some of the layers of the leek and slice each layer separately. If you find bits of dirt deep within the leek, don’t fret. You can place all the leek slivers in a sieve and rinse again once more to remove any stubborn flecks of dirt.
2. Transfer the sliced leek to a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry to remove any excess water.

**Steep the saffron:**

1. Place the crushed saffron in a small bowl and cover it with 2 tablespoons of hot water. Set aside.

**Prepare the guanciale chili oil:**

1. Place the guanciale in a large pot (you’ll use this pot later for the orzo and cod!) and turn the heat to medium. Cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes until the fat renders and the guanciale becomes crispy.
2. Add the shallot, garlic, and crushed red pepper and cook for an additional 3 minutes, turning often and adjusting the heat as needed to prevent the garlic from browning. Once the shallot softens, and the garlic takes on a very light golden color, spoon the mixture into a bowl. Scoop out all but a tablespoon of the fat from the pot and add it to the bowl of guanciale.
3. Pour the extra virgin olive oil, chili oil, and maple syrup over the guanciale. Stir vigorously to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add more maple syrup, chili oil, or crushed red pepper, depending on your preferences.
4. The guanciale oil will keep in an airtight jar for up to 5 days.

**Prepare the saffron cod and orzo:**

1. Pat the cod dry and season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Return the pot of remaining guanciale fat to medium heat. Add the sliced fennel bulb and stalks along with the sliced shallot. Season with salt and cook for 5–6 minutes until the fennel begins to soften.
3. Add the garlic and cook for 1–2 minutes until just fragrant.
4. Melt the butter into the pot and add the orzo. Stir to coat and cook for 1–2 minutes until it begins to lightly toast. Season with salt.
5. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil for 2–3 minutes. Stir often to lift up any orzo that may have stuck to the bottom.
6. Reduce heat to low and arrange the cod on top. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Drizzle the steeped saffron mixture all over, ensuring that each piece of cod gets a little bit of saffron water.
7. Cover and simmer over low heat for 12–15 minutes or until the cod is opaque and the orzo is tender.

**Frizzle the leek:**

1. *Note: Use a saucepan that has somewhat high sides. Generally, you want a saucepan that’s at least 6–8 inches deep. When you add the leeks to the hot oil, the oil will foam up vigorously, and you do NOT want it pouring over the edges.*
2. As the cod simmers, make the leeks. In a saucepan, pour in 2 inches of vegetable oil. Turn the heat to medium-high. Break off a piece of leek and add it to the pot; if it bubbles rapidly, it’s ready to fry.
3. Working in small batches, add a handful of the leeks at a time to the oil. Stir occasionally and fry for 15–20 seconds until golden brown. Remove and–using tongs–transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Continue on until all the leeks are fried. Pat any excess oil off from the tops of the leeks with a paper towel and season with flaky sea salt. Set aside.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the cooked orzo into shallow bowls and place a piece of cod on top. Arrange the frizzled leeks next to the cod and drizzle with the guanciale chili oil. Sprinkle a few bits of fennel fronds on top if you remember (unlike me…).

These are poke bowl style, but use seasoned sushi rice as the base. If you would rather make this as a poke bowl, skip the sushi rice section and just use plain white rice. You can easily customize these with whatever extra toppings you like.

**Original Recipe**: [https://craftycookbook.com/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls/](https://craftycookbook.com/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls/)

**Time:** 50 mins

**Servings:** 2 XL bowls (as pictured) or 3-4 smaller servings

**Ingredients**

*For Sushi Rice:*

* 1 1/2 cups medium grain sushi rice
* 1 3/4 cups warm water
* 6 tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar *(This should have no calories. If it has calories, the vinegar is already seasoned with sugar and salt.)*
* 2 tbsp white sugar
* 1 1/2 tsp table salt

*For Sesame Salmon:*

* 6-10 oz sushi quality salmon (pictured is 5 oz per bowl)\*\*
* 2 green onions
* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp toasted white sesame seeds

*To Finish Bowls:*

* 1/2 medium-sized ripe avocado, optional
* \~1/2 cup shelled, frozen edamame, optional
* \~1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion, optional
* \~1/4 cup daikon sprouts, optional
* other veggies such as carrots, cucumber, nori, bean sprouts, etc optional

\*\*I purchase fish marked for sushi/sashimi from a Japanese grocery store, but this isn't the only option available.

**To Prepare Sushi Rice:**

1. The rice takes about 50 minutes to prepare, but has a lot of hands-off time. The salmon and veggies for this meal can be prepared as the rice cooks. Optionally, you can substitute plain white rice to make this recipe as a poke bowl instead.
2. Place the rice in a large pot (that has a lid). Rinse and drain the rice until the water runs clear, at least 3 times (rinse the rice even if the bag says it's ""prewashed""). Drain as much water as possible.
3. Add 1 3/4 cup lukewarm water to the pot, close with the lid, and place on the stove top.
4. Heat over medium-high heat until the water begins to boil, once boiling cook over medium-high heat for 4 minutes, then reduce heat to very-low and simmer for 15 minutes.
5. After simmering, remove from heat and let the pot stand undisturbed for another 15 minutes.
6. Scoop the rice into a large non-metallic bowl. Dust with sugar and salt, then pour over the rice vinegar. Using a rice spatula or non-stick spatula mix everything together and break up all the clumps of rice. Mix until every grain of rice is separated and coated in vinegar, the sugar and salt should dissolve completely. Don't worry if the rice seems too wet at this point, that will go away as it cools.
7. Allow the rice to cool uncovered, mixing occasionally, until it reaches room temp (about 15 minutes). You can speed this process along by fanning the rice if desired. The rice should be slightly sticky once it's cooled.

**To Prepare Veggies:**

1. Boil the edamame per package",1582,0.9799804688,Seafood,yellowjacquet,1672856231000,https://i.redd.it/015gmv1g04aa1.jpg,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/103an4j/sesame_salmon_sushi_bowls/,Sesame & ginger sushi bowls,449.0,0.8,21.0,6.0,4.0,44.0,17.0,11.0,0.94

If you like this recipe I would really appreciate a visit to my independent website [Leviathan Food](https://www.leviathanfood.com/), where there are plenty more that I developed.

**INGREDIENTS**

* 12 scallops
* 300ml sunflower oil
* 15g fresh ginger
* 2 heaped tbsp. gochugaru
* 1 - 2 heaped tbsp. chilli flakes
* 2 large scallions
* 4 garlic cloves
* 1 1/2 tsp. white sugar
* 2 tbsp. black sesame seeds
* 1 lemon
* 3 star anise
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 2 tbsp. tamari
* 1 tbsp. rice wine vinegar

**METHOD**

1.) Finely chop the scallions, garlic and ginger. Add half the sunflower oil to a pot on a medium heat. When it has come up to temperature add the scallions and cook for about three minutes. The oil will bubble as the water cooks out of them. Make sure they do not brown. Add the ginger, star anise and cinnamon and cook for another two minutes, stirring every so often, before adding the garlic and continuing to cook.

2.) In a bowl combine the gochugaru, sugar, black sesame seeds and chilli flakes. one tbsp. of chilli will give you a milder rāyu. If you like more of a kick you can add an extra spoonful. Add the mixture in the the pot and top off with the remainder of the oil. Stir well, and cook over a low to medium heat on a gentle and constant simmer for 12 - 15 minutes, taking care not to allow anything to burn or brown too much.

3.) Add the tamari and the rice wine vinegar and stir. Turn the heat off and allow to cook before placing in a sterilised jar. This should keep in the fridge for a few weeks.

4.) Remove scallops from the fridge to come to room temperature. Add oil and butter to a pan on a high heat. Pat them dry and season with coarse salt and pepper before placing in the pan flat side down. Push them down slightly and cook for about two minutes until a deep golden colour. Turn and cook or another minute or two. Baste with the butter. They should be springy to the touch and just warm in the centre when tested with a metal skewer.

1. In a pot, bring 5 cups of chicken/shrimp stock to a boil along with the shrimp shells. When boiling, lower to a simmer for about 10-15 min, allowing to stock to reduce a bit. Press the shrimp shells with spatula to extract all the stock through a sieve/colander. Discard the shells. 
2. Add lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, bird's eye chilies, mushrooms, and nam prik pao to the shrimp/chicken stock and bring it to boil.
3. Lower the heat to low and simmer for about 10-15 min. Add in the shrimp and fish sauce; cook until the shrimp are just pink and cooked through (do NOT overcook!).
4. Lastly, add the lime juice (if you add lime juice too early, the soup may turn bitter). Serve and enjoy.

 **Cauliflower curry purée:**

* 2 tablespoons neutral oil
* 2 shallots or 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced
* 1 medium head cauliflower (about 1 pound), trimmed and cut into florets
* 1½ tablespoons curry powder of choice, I used a hot Punjabi masala
* 3 cups water, plus more if needed
* 15- ounce can full-fat coconut milk
* Salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to taste

**Basmati rice (optional):**

* 1 shallot or small yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 cup basmati rice
* 1¾ cups water
* ½ cup frozen peas

**For serving (optional):**

* Lime wedges, cilantro, sliced Serrano or bird’s eye chili peppers

**Sauté the vegetables:**

1. Heat 2 tablespoons neutral oil in a large, wide pot over medium heat. Add the shallot (or onion) and potatoes and cook, often stirring, for 5 minutes. Season all over with salt and pepper.
2. Add the cauliflower florets and arrange them into an even layer. Sizzle in the oil for 4–5 minutes until they begin to char around the edges. Season with salt.
3. Create a well in the middle of the pot and add another splash of oil if the pot is dry. Add the curry powder to the hot oil and let it bloom for 30–40 seconds. Toss to coat the vegetables in the powder and season again with salt if needed. Add red pepper flakes if you like extra heat.

**Simmer the vegetables:**

1. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes or until the cauliflower and potatoes are fork-tender. Stir the vegetables occasionally to ensure they haven't stuck. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.

**Prepare the basmati rice (optional):**

1. While the vegetables simmer, make the rice. First, rinse the rice thoroughly. Set aside.
2. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 3–4 minutes.
3. Add the rice and season all over with salt. Stir for 1–2 minutes until it just begins to toast. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15–17 minutes.
4. Turn off the heat. Remove the lid and quickly add the frozen peas (do not stir them into the rice). Cover and let the residual heat steam the peas for 5–10 minutes. Remove the cover and stir to combine. Taste and add salt, if needed.

**Finish the purée:**

1. Pour in the coconut milk and simmer for 5 minutes. Using an immersion blender, blend until completely smooth and creamy. Add more water in ¼ cup increments until desired consistency is reached. You may need up to 1 cup of additional water if serving as soup. If serving as a purée, you may not need water at all. Taste and season.

## To serve:

1. Spoon the purée into shallow bowls. Pile the rice on top. Garnish with cilantro, lime, and sliced green chilies.

This is for an upcoming project for 5-ingredient vegan meals thus the sparse ingredients! 5 ingredients do not include water, cooking oil, salt, or pepper.

It was still super tasty and is a great recipe to build upon. You could easily add garlic, roasted poblano peppers, or extra plant or meat protein to the soup.

For extra plant protein, I would add white beans or tofu crumbles or top with fried tofu chorizo crumbles.

If you want to do meat, I would do something light like shrimp or chicken.

You can also get creative with toppings like what I suggested below or add some crispy tortillas, crushed crackers, finely chopped tomatoes, or minced red onion.

* 1 tablespoon neutral oil
* 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced
* 1 cup quinoa, rinsed
* 5–6 cups of water or vegetable stock
* 2 ears of sweet corn, husked and cut from the cob
* 1 cup loosely packed cilantro, minced
* 6 ounces plant-based cream or coconut milk
* Salt and pepper to taste

**For serving:**

* Sliced jalapeño
* Lime
* Cilantro

**Method:**

Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook in the oil for 6–7 minutes, turning occasionally, until they just begin to soften.

Add the quinoa to the potatoes and cook for 1 minute.

Pour in 5 cups of water or vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Once boiling, reduce heat to a hard simmer and cook for 20 minutes or until the quinoa is tender. If the soup is too thick, add the remaining 1 cup water or stock.

Add the corn, cilantro, and cream to the soup and simmer for an additional 5–6 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.

Ladle the chowder into bowls. Garnish with jalapeño slices, a lime wedge, and a few more cilantro leaves if you like.

**Ingredients:**

- 3 medium onions

- 1 chilli pepper

- 2 cloves of garlic

- 2 large apples

- 3 medium potatoes

- 200g cooked chickpeas

- 150g butter

- 500 ml vegetable broth

- 400 ml heavy cream

- 2 tbsp curry powder

- A bunch of mint

- Salt to taste


**Preparation:**

1. Prepare your veggies: finely dice the onion and chilli. Mince the garlic. Cut the apple and potatoes into cubes, 2 by 2 cm should be ideal. I actually like to peel the potatoes but leave the skin on the apples.

2. Begin by heating the butter in a pot over medium heat. Once it’s melted, add the onion and immediately salt it so it releases some moisture. Sweat for 4 minutes, then add your chilli and garlic. Cook for 2 minutes, then add the curry powder and cook for another 2 minutes.

3. Add the apples and broth. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. 

4. Remove half of what’s in the pot, blend it and return to the pot.

5. Add the potatoes, chickpeas, and cream, then cook for 15 minutes or until the potatoes are soft.

The high humidity and cold temperatures of this season work in favour of mycelium, bringing us a vast variety of delicious mushrooms. On my short staycation in Lake District, I found a few beautiful Porcini mushrooms that you can see in the picture as well as multiple Larch Boletes referred to in my country as butter mushrooms. They have slimy caps and are perfect for sauces, soups or pickles. As the name suggests Larch Bolete can be found growing in symbiosis with Larch trees starting in July till November.  
  
This is my family recipe for a delicious and filling mushroom soup, perfect after a fungi hunt. It contains pasta and a variety of vegetables that elevate the mushroom flavour. The recipe works with Boletus mushrooms but if not available you can prepare them with chestnut mushrooms instead.  
  
In Poland, mushroom picking is very popular among families and the knowledge is passed from generation to generation. Make sure to always pick mushrooms with someone who knows what they doing, or pick specimens that are hard to confuse, I always recommend signing up for a foraging experience! It is great fun and you can learn something new! :)

For the full recipe with step by step pictures: [http://meza-blog.com/recipe/beetroot-risotto/](http://meza-blog.com/recipe/beetroot-risotto/)

**INGREDIENTS**

**Risotto:**

 

* 2 medium beetroots
* 170 gr rice, arborio or carnarroli
* 140 ml water
* 1 onion
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 dl white wine
* 0.5 liter vegetable stock, (more if needed)
* 1 tablespoon butter, preferably room temp
* 20 gr grated parmesan cheese

**garnish:**

* 50 gr fresh goat cheese
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* pinch of salt
* 1/2 teaspoon orange zest

**METHOD:**

 

1)Start by making the puree for your risotto. Simply place your beetroots in a baking tray, cover with aluminum foil and place inside a pre heated oven on 180\*C.

2)Bake the beetroots until fork tender (piercing a fork inside without applying any pressure). Time may vary from 45 minutes to 2 hours.

3)Once fork tender, peel the skin off, dice the beets roughly and blend with a stix mixer.  
your beatiful beetroot puree is now ready to use!

For the garnish:

1)Place your cheese, olive oil and salt into a shallow mixing bowl and blend well with a stix mixer.

2)Pass the creamy mixture through a fine sieve to assure a more stable texture.

3)Mix well with the orange zest and set aside for further use.

For the risotto:

1)Start by preparing the rice. Take a skillet or shallow pot and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your rice.

2)Stir constantly for about 2-3 minutes until the edges of the grain start becoming translucent.

3)Now that we build a protective layer around the grain, pour in your water and stir frequently until all the water has evaporated.

4)Transfer the rice onto a tin, and let cool.

5)Once cool, your rice is ready to use. This is a neat little step worth making when cooking risotto as it helps release more of that starchy goodness later on when cooking the risotto. Par-cooked rice like this can last up to a week in a food container in your fridge and will greatly shorten your time preparing risotto.

6)Now take your skillet and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle over a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your diced onions.

7)Saute the onions until soft and translucent. It will probably take in between 7-10 minutes.

8)Once your onions are beautifully tender, add in your finely minced garlic and stir for another minute.

9)Now add in your rice and season with salt and pepper. (This is the perfect time to add salt as it will drain any extra juices which will be absorbed by the rice.)

10)Stir constantly for another minute or two and proceed to pour in your wine.

11)Keep stirring (from this moment on, you’ll have to be stirring most of the time as more motion the rice makes, the more starch it releases, creating a creamy texture.) until all the wine has evaporated.

12)Now that your wine has evaporated, add 3 tablespoons of your beetroot pure and stir until incorporated.  


13)Now start adding your vegetable stock (hot! so it doesn’t prevent the rice from continuing to cook.) a little at a time as the rice absorbs the liquid. The reason you don’t pour it all at the same time is because you don’t know how much liquid the rice will absorb.  


14)When the rice is cooked al-dente  it should still have a slightly “runny to watery” texture, we don’t want it thick.

15)Now turn off the heat and add the butter, preferably room temperature so it blends more quickly

16)Once you add the butter, now is the time to really work your hand, and give the rice a good beating, stirring it vigorously until all the butter has blended with the dish.  


17)After the butter has blended add the parmesan cheese and beat again, this time not as vigorously until the cheese has melted.",114,0.9799804688,Fruit\Vegetarian,Zamezi,1610287492000,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kuezx3,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/kuezx3/beetroot_risotto_with_creamy_goat_cheese/,Beetroot risotto with feta,727.0,1.9,24.0,19.0,9.0,93.0,22.0,8.0,0.96

Some variations include carrot, and others use more vinegar and sugar but I find this ratio of vinegar to sugar the best since it doesn’t result in an overly watery Acar (pronounced Achar like Charmander). It’s fantastic on a very warm day. 

**Ingredients** (can be amended to suit your tastes)

* One cucumber. Roughly peel the cucumber so you get that lovely variation in green colour. Score lengthways with a fork. Slice lengthways once through the middle and then chop thinly. 
Realistically you can cut them up however you like but a thin slice is best imo.

* Half a small pineapple, chopped. 

* Half a red onion (or one shallot), sliced as thinly as possible. 

* One red chilli, thinly sliced. Or more if you like spicy stuff.

* Two tablespoons of white vinegar 

* Two teaspoons of white sugar 

* Half a teaspoon of salt
