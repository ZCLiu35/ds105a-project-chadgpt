19d0wfc,Buffalo Chicken Tenders,202,12,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Buffalo Chicken Tenders**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/buffalo-chicken-tenders/)

I use Frank's, but you can use your favorite cayenne-based hot sauce, or like my dad...you can make a little wing sauce concoction of all your favorite random hot sauces in your fridge.

**Ingredients:**

* 1¼  pounds chicken tenderloins
* ½ cup flour
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons Frank’s RedHot Original Hot Sauce, or use your favorite cayenne-based hot sauce
* 2 cups panko
* 4 scallions, trimmed and minced
* Neutral oil, for frying
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the chicken:**

1. Pat the chicken tenderloins dry and season with salt and pepper.

**Set up your dredging station:**

1. Set out three shallow dishes. To the first dish, add flour, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and a pinch of salt. To the second dish, add 2 eggs plus 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and whisk until smooth. Add panko with a pinch of salt and pepper to the third dish.

**Preheat the oil:**

1. Add about ¼ inch of neutral oil to a wide pot or skillet. You only need enough oil to come up to half the thickness of a chicken tender. Turn the heat to medium-low to preheat the oil.

**Dredge the chicken:**

1. Dip a chicken tenderloin into the flour and shake off the excess. Next, dip it into the egg mixture and shake off the excess. Finish dredging the chicken by rolling it gently in the panko; gently press it into the tender to ensure it adheres. Transfer to a baking rack. Continue until all tenders are dredged.

**Heat the sauce:**

1. Simmer the remaining 1 cup of hot sauce over low heat as you fry the chicken tenders.

**Fry the chicken tenders:**

1. Turn the heat on the oil to medium. If you drop a piece of panko into the pot, it should bubble and sizzle but not overly vigorously. You can use a meat thermometer to ensure it is 350ºF.
2. Once the oil is hot, fry the chicken tenders in batches, about 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown. Once the tenders reach 165ºF, transfer them to a cooling rack or paper towel-lined plate.

**Sauce the tenders:**

1. Once all the chicken tenders are fried, pour the warm sauce into a large bowl.
2. Add the chicken tenders to the bowl in batches and toss gently to coat in the sauce.

**To serve:**

1. Transfer the sauced tenders to a serving platter and sprinkle with minced scallions.

18zcqmd,Cinnamon Rolls,256,21,"# Homemade Cinnamon Rolls

For full recipe, tips, &amp; tricks, visit: [https://maplewoodroad.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/](https://maplewoodroad.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/)

**INGREDIENTS**  
***Cinnamon Roll Dough***

* 1 cup warm milk (not hot)
* 2-½ teaspoons instant yeast
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* ¼ cup butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 4 cups all purpose flour

***Filling***

* ¾ cup light brown sugar, packed
* 2 tablespoons cinnamon
* ½ cup butter, softened

***Icing***

* 6 ounces cream cheese, softened
* 1-½ cups powdered sugar
* ⅓ cup butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  


**INSTRUCTIONS**  
***Making the Dough***

1. Place warm milk in a mixing bowl, add yeast, and give it a stir. Let it sit for a minute or two while you’re gathering your other ingredients. 
2. Next, add sugar, eggs, butter, salt, and vanilla, and mix well. Lastly, using a dough hook, add flour and mix until it forms a firm yet tacky dough that pulls away from the edges. Resist adding more flour…the dough should be slightly tacky.
3. Remove dough from the mixer and knead by hand, on a lightly floured surface, for 5 minutes (yes, even if you used a stand mixer).

***First Rising***

1. Grease a large bowl with butter or cooking spray. Place the dough in this bowl, cover with a warm towel, and let sit in a warm spot for 1 to 1-½ hours or until it doubles in size.

***Cinnamon Roll Filling***

1. In a bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until it resembles a paste.

***Rolling out the dough, adding filling, and cutting into shape***

1. For this step, I used silicone baking mats, but you can also roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring approximately 22” x 14”.
2. Drop some of the cinnamon roll filling here and there over the rolled out dough. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently spread the filling all over the dough, keeping away from the edges by about a quarter inch.
3. Starting at a short end (one of the 14” ends), gently but tightly roll the dough into one long roll.
4. Using a sharp knife (I found that a serrated knife worked best), cut the roll into 12 evenly sliced pieces. 

***Second Rising***

1. Preheat oven to 350℉.
2. Place the cut cinnamon rolls into a parchment-lined baking dish, three rows of four.
3. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes, or until they’ve nearly doubled in size.

***Baking Cinnamon Rolls***

1. Remove the plastic wrap and place baking pan in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 20 – 30 minutes. My cinnamon rolls took 30 minutes to bake, but you should start checking on them after 20 minutes. All ovens are different. The cinnamon rolls will be done when the tops have just lightly browned and the dough sounds hollow when you lightly tap on it with a spoon. The rolls will rise even more while they’re baking and will most likely touch each other. This is fine and good…they’ll stay soft in the middle.

***Icing for Cinnamon Rolls***

1. While the rolls are baking, make the icing. Using either a stand mixer or handheld mixer, blend together cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla until smooth. 
2. When the cinnamon rolls are done baking, let them cool about 5 minutes and add icing to the tops, so it will slightly melt and ooze between the swirls. If you prefer the icing thicker on top, wait until they’ve fully cooled.",1704476711000,0.9599609375,Recipe,pangibear,https://i.redd.it/7uef78dbsnac1.jpeg,https://oauth.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18zcqmd/cinnamon_rolls/,https://reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/18zcqmd/cinnamon_rolls/,Cinnamon rolls,415.0,18.0,0.9
18vf164,Mushroom-Taleggio Risotto,184,6,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Mushroom-Taleggio Risotto Recipe**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/mushroom-taleggio-risotto-recipe/)

* .5 ounces dry porcini mushrooms
* 1 cup boiling water
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 leek, white and light green part only; trimmed, scrubbed thoroughly, and thinly sliced into half-moons
* 1 cup arborio rice
* 5–6 cups warm water or vegetable stock, more or less as needed
* 4 ounces Taleggio cheese, rind removed
* ½ cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
* 2 tablespoons finely minced parsley
* 1 lemon, juiced
* Sweet pea tendrils, optional, for serving
* Salt and pepper

**Prepare the porcini mushrooms:**

1. Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl. Pour 1 cup boiling water over the mushrooms and soak for 20 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the water and finely chop them. Reserve the soaking liquid for the risotto.

**Fry the cremini mushrooms:**

1. Place a large pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium. Add the sliced cremini mushrooms to the dry pot and cook, turning occasionally, for 8–10 minutes. The mushrooms will release water and begin to dry out.
2. Once all the liquid evaporates from the pot, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 8–10 minutes more, turning regularly, until browned and crisp. Season with salt and pepper.

**Cook the leek:**

1. Add the leek and chopped porcini mushrooms to the pot. Cook, turning occasionally, for 5 minutes until the leek softens.

**Toast the rice:**

1. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot. Add the rice and cook for 2–3 minutes until it begins to toast. Season with salt and pepper.

**Begin adding liquid:**

1. Add the porcini soaking liquid and stir to incorporate and lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring periodically until the rice absorbs all the liquid.
2. Add warm water or vegetable stock in ladleful increments, stirring after each addition and adding more liquid once the rice absorbs what’s in the pot. Stir occasionally, but not constantly. You may need to adjust the heat between medium and medium-low to prevent the risotto from sticking.
3. After 20–25 minutes, the rice should be tender and the liquid creamy. You may need 4–5 cups of liquid, give or take. Taste and add more salt and pepper.

**Finish the risotto:**

1. Turn the heat to low. Add the Taleggio cheese and stir to incorporate. Continue stirring until the cheese melts completely. Add the Parmesan cheese, minced parsley, and lemon juice. Simmer for 2–3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Taste and season, and let the risotto stand for 5 minutes.

**To serve:**

1. Spoon the risotto into a large serving bowl. Garnish with sweet pea tendrils and a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese if you like.

18tse01,Turmeric Chicken Soup,138,9,"**Recipe here originally:** [**Turmeric Chicken Soup**](https://www.triedandtruerecipe.com/turmeric-chicken-soup/)

**Ingredients:**

* 1 duck breast
* 350 gram sweet potato
* 100 gram spinach
* 100 gram mushrooms (I used Shimei)
* 10 leaves of sage
* 1 shallot
* 4 cloves of garlic
* 100-gram cold butter
* a splash of cream (around 1 tbsp)
* 200 ml port wine (ruby or tawny)
* 200 ml chicken (or poultry) stock
* olive oil for pan-frying

**Directions:**

1. First of all, try to remove your duck breast from the fridge 1 hour before you start cooking to make sure it will be at room temperature when you pan-sear the duck. Then peel your sweet potatoes and cut them into even-sized cubes. Add to a pan, together with 75 ml of water, 50 grams of butter, and a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a simmer and turn low. Let this simmer for about 25 minutes.
2. In the meantime, it is time to prepare the sauce. Finely chop the shallot and saute for 2 minutes on medium heat. Add your stock and port wine and reduce by half or until the reduction thickens. Set this aside, clean your mushrooms and finely chop your garlic. Heat your frying pan and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Fry your sage leaves in the oil for about 20-30 seconds or until crispy and put them on a piece of kitchen paper. 
3. Now we are getting there! Preheat your oven to 160 degrees Celsius. Score the fat side of the duck breast (but not too deep) and add it to the already hot pan with the fat side down. Make sure your pan is on medium heat and let the fat render for about 5 minutes or until evenly golden and crispy. Then turn over the duck breast, add a small knob of butter to the pan, and baste your duck for two more minutes. Now add this to an oven dish and continue cooking for about 8 more minutes or until a core temperature of 53 degrees Celsius. 
4. In the meantime, we fry our mushrooms with half of the garlic and a bit of olive oil until nicely golden, add them to an ovenproof dish, and put them in the oven next to the duck. Now add some olive oil the rest of the garlic and your spinach to the pan. Saute until it is fragrant and welted down and set aside. Now you mash your sweet potatoes with a tbsp of cream and salt and pepper to taste. Since we used only a little bit of water, we didn't have to drain them before mashing them to create the ultimate texture and flavor. reheat your port reduction and cut off the heat again, add 50 grams of cold butter and combine with a whisk. 
5. After your duck hits 53 degrees Celsius you let it rest on your counter for about 10 minutes and then we are ready to plate the dish. Start with a layer of your potato puree and add the spinach and mushrooms on top. Slice your duck into 6 pieces and add 3 pieces to both plates (like in the picture). Finish with the sauce and crispy sage leaves and your dish is finished.

**Ingredients:**

* 4 scallops (as fresh as you can get)
* 100 grams of ""zeeuws spek"" (spiced and smoked pork belly)
* Green asparagus tips
* 200 ml of white wine
* 1 shallot
* 100 grams of cold butter
* A splash of cream (around 1 tbsp)
* Finely chopped chives for garnish
* Edible flowers for garnish
* Bones, head, and skin of one smoked mackerel or eel
* Two sticks of celery
* 1 carrot
* Half a leek
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 onion
* 2 bay leaves

**Directions:**

1. If you are making your stock from scratch, this is where we should start. First clean and rough-chop your vegetables. Add the fishbones and all the vegetables to a large pot and cover with about two liters of water, bring to a simmer and let this simmer on low heat for about 30-40 minutes. In the meantime skim any foam off the pan to create a nice and clear broth. After this 30 minutes simmer, we are going to strain the stock in another pot and put it back on medium-high heat, and continue till the stock is reduced to ⅓ of what you started with. 
2. Now it is time to prepare the sauce. finely chop the shallot and sautee for 2 minutes on medium heat. add 200 ml of white wine and 200 ml of your already reduced stock. let this simmer until reduced by half and then strain out the onions and add your reduction back to the pan. Set this aside for now.
3. Fill a small pan with water and bring to a boil. Then blanch your asparagus for about two minutes. Drain them and cool them down with cold water. Slice your bacon/zeeuws spek in thick slices and trim them until they almost have the size of a scallop. 
4. Now it’s time to finish the dish. Put your saucepan on low heat with your reduction. Start with frying your bacon in a dry pan on medium heat until crispy golden brown. let them drain on a piece of kitchen paper and then sear your scallops for two minutes on the first side, so they turn nicely golden brown. On the other side I usually sear a little bit shorter because you don’t want to overcook them; about 60-90 seconds. 
5. Finish the sauce by adding the cream to your warm reduction and simmer for 30 seconds. then turn off the heat and add your cubed cold butter in small batches while whisking and incorporating the butter in the sauce. serve the scallops and bacon on the asparagus. Add the beurre blanc sauce and the chives and flowers as garnish.

4.	⁠⁠Place the soaked bread slices onto the heated skillet and cook until golden brown on each side, about 2-3 minutes per side.

5.   Serve the French toast warm, topped with a drizzle of maple syrup, a dusting of powdered sugar, and fresh berries if desired. (I personally like it this way)

18ecyxp,Chorizo &amp; Prawns Paella,223,36,"&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

\* 0.7 lbs Chorizo - (300g) sliced

\* 0.6 lbs King Prawns - (250g) You can use raw, frozen.

\* 1.3 cups Bomba Rice - (250g) Spanish Paella Rice

\* 2 Bell Peppers - small dice

\* White mushrooms - (200g) sliced

\* 2 Onions, medium size - small dice

\* 3 Garlic cloves - minced

\* 2.5 cups Vegetable Stock - (600ml)

\* 4 Ripe tomatoes, medium size - cut into wedges

\* 1 tbsp Paprika - Use Hungarian Sheged for best quality

\* 1 tsp Turmeric

\* 1 tsp Ground cumin

\* 1 pinch Saffron

\* 1 Lime - juice only

\* 1 handful Parsley - (optional for garnish)

\* 2 tbsp Olive oil - for frying (no need if chorizo releases a lot of fat)

&amp;#x200B;

**Instructions:**

1. In a large paella pan or a wide frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over high heat. Add chorizo slices and fry until they start to crisp, about 3-5 minutes. Keep the chorizo in the pan.
2. Reduce the heat to medium and add onions to the pan with chorizo and cook for about 5 minutes until they become translucent. Then add bell peppers and mushrooms, cooking until they soften, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
3. Add the Bomba rice to the pan, stirring to ensure it's well coated with the oils and juices.Cook the rice for about 2 minutes until it starts to become translucent. Stir in paprika, turmeric, ground cumin, and a pinch of saffron.
4. Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Let it simmer gently for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to evenly distribute the heat.
5. Add the tomato wedges and nestle the king prawns into the rice. Continue to cook for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and cooked through, and the rice is tender. You can cover the pan at this stage with a lid and do not stir it to develop delicious soccarat.
6. Remove the pan from the heat. Squeeze in the juice of one lime and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan back with a lid and let it rest for 5 minutes.
7. Sprinkle the paella with chopped parsley for a fresh finish. Serve directly from the pan, ensuring each portion includes some of the delicious socarrat (caramelized and slightly crispy layer of rice that forms at the bottom of the pan)
