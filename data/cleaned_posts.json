        "recipe_comment":"# Crispy Jumbo Potato Chips \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 6 Fresh Russets all the same size (150g)\n* 4 Liters Canola oil for deep frying\n* 2 tsp Lye Water (Koon Chun brand)\n* Coarse Salt\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Peel and keep in cold water. \n2. Cut into thirds longways (3 thick slices).\n3. Cut the 2 side slices in half and the center one in thirds.\n4. Rinse and store in water until ready to move on. \n5. Add 2 liters of water and 2 tsp lye water to a large pot.\n6. Bring the water to boil and add potatoes. \n7. Start a timer when the water returns to a boil. \n8. Reduce heat to a soft boil and cook for exactly 7 minutes.\n9. Quickly and very gently ladle chips in to an ice bath. Dry on a rack.\n10. Preheat deep oil to 170C\/340F\n11. Fry in batches until color just starts to change.\n12. Drain and cool on a rack.\n13. Transfer rack to the freezer overnight.\n14. Preheat deep oil to 190C\/375F\n15. Fry in small batches until golden and crispy.\n\nTip: Fresh potatoes is key. They should be very firm and no sprouting eyes. Russets are the best around these parts but other high starch varieties should work.\n\nTip: The water is a very weak lye solution but you should be careful. No splashing and gloves\/eye wear is not overkill.\n\nTip: The lye water helps break down the edges resulting in crispy edges. Baking soda should work but I find the taste a little harsher.\n\nTip: The square center chip tends to break so add them in the water late. There's six of them and can be used elsewhere. \n\nTip: Don't let the ice crystals melt. They cause the chaos for the extra crispy edges. You want super cold into super hot.\n\nTip: After the first fry these will keep in the freezer for a while. Just try not to damage the edges.",

        "recipe_comment":"You could use any curry paste you like. Do you have a favourite shop-bought paste or a homemade Panang curry paste in the freezer? Feel free to use that one. Making use of a curry paste for a marinade is a real shortcut to a flavor-packed BBQ-dish!  \nFull recipe: https:\/\/www.misterspiceguy.com\/recipes\/thai-green-curry-chicken-satay\n\n**Ingredients for chicken satay:**\n\n* 3 tbsp homemade green curry paste (or any other curry paste)\n* 1 tbsp vegetable oil\n* 500g chicken fillet or thighs, cut into thin strips\n* 1 tbsp palm sugar\n* 1 tbsp fish sauce (nam pla)\n* 150 ml coconut milk\n* 2 tbsp lime juice\u200d\n\n**Ingredients for satay sauce:**\n\n* 1 heaped tbsp of green curry paste\n* 1 tbsp of vegetable oil\n* 2 tbsp of peanut butter (preferably crunchy)\n* 4 tbsp of roasted peanuts, coarsely ground\/chopped\n* 150 ml coconut milk\n* 1 tsp fish sauce\n* 1 tbsp palm\/regular sugar\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. \u200dThe first step will be cutting up your chicken thighs in chunks of your preference. I personally like to make the cubes approximately 1cm x 1cm, because I don't like to grill the satay for to long. Most important is that you are consistent in the cutting size, so that your satay will cook evenly. Then put all the other satay ingredients in a bowl and give a whisk, add your chicken and put in the fridge for at least one hour but ideally overnight. If you are using wooden skewers, make sure you soak them in water to prevent burning on the BBQ.\n2. \u200dNow it's time to make the peanut-satay sauce. Start by heating up the vegetable oil in a small saucepan on a medium heat. Fry your curry paste for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. Then add all the other sauce ingredients and make sure you put it on your smallest burner on a real low heat. slowly simmer the sauce for about 5 minutes and your satay sauce will be finished. If you cook your satay sauce too long or on a high heat you will see that al the oil from the peanuts and the coconut milk separate and start floating on top, that is not what we are aiming for!\n3. \u200dSkew your chicken satay on the soaked skewers and now it's time to grill the satay. Ideally we do this on a BBQ but sometimes you want to make this dish in winter or you don't want to start a fire. In this case you can also use a griddle pan. Grill your satays on a medium-high heat and make sure you keep turning them often. After about 5 minutes of grilling (depending on your chunk size) your chicken satay will be ready to eat. Serve with the peanut sauce. Enjoy!",

Otherwise, you can bake them for about 60 minutes for a more firm\/baked texture. Let the brownies cool down completely before removing them from the pan; this is probably the hardest part. Enjoy!",

Pat the chicken tenderloins dry and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Set up your dredging station:**\n\n1. Set out three shallow dishes. To the first dish, add flour, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and a pinch of salt. To the second dish, add 2 eggs plus 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and whisk until smooth. Add panko with a pinch of salt and pepper to the third dish.\n\n**Preheat the oil:**\n\n1. Add about \u00bc inch of neutral oil to a wide pot or skillet. You only need enough oil to come up to half the thickness of a chicken tender. Turn the heat to medium-low to preheat the oil.\n\n**Dredge the chicken:**\n\n1. Dip a chicken tenderloin into the flour and shake off the excess. Next, dip it into the egg mixture and shake off the excess. Finish dredging the chicken by rolling it gently in the panko; gently press it into the tender to ensure it adheres. Transfer to a baking rack. Continue until all tenders are dredged.\n\n**Heat the sauce:**\n\n1. Simmer the remaining 1 cup of hot sauce over low heat as you fry the chicken tenders.\n\n**Fry the chicken tenders:**\n\n1. Turn the heat on the oil to medium. If you drop a piece of panko into the pot, it should bubble and sizzle but not overly vigorously. You can use a meat thermometer to ensure it is 350\u00baF.\n2. Once the oil is hot, fry the chicken tenders in batches, about 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown. Once the tenders reach 165\u00baF, transfer them to a cooling rack or paper towel-lined plate.\n\n**Sauce the tenders:**\n\n1. Once all the chicken tenders are fried, pour the warm sauce into a large bowl.\n2. Add the chicken tenders to the bowl in batches and toss gently to coat in the sauce.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Transfer the sauced tenders to a serving platter and sprinkle with minced scallions. Enjoy!",

Place warm milk in a mixing bowl, add yeast, and give it a stir. Let it sit for a minute or two while you\u2019re gathering your other ingredients. \n2. Next, add sugar, eggs, butter, salt, and vanilla, and mix well. Lastly, using a dough hook, add flour and mix until it forms a firm yet tacky dough that pulls away from the edges. Resist adding more flour\u2026the dough should be slightly tacky.\n3. Remove dough from the mixer and knead by hand, on a lightly floured surface, for 5 minutes (yes, even if you used a stand mixer).\n\n***First Rising***\n\n1. Grease a large bowl with butter or cooking spray. Place the dough in this bowl, cover with a warm towel, and let sit in a warm spot for 1 to 1-\u00bd hours or until it doubles in size.\n\n***Cinnamon Roll Filling***\n\n1. In a bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until it resembles a paste.\n\n***Rolling out the dough, adding filling, and cutting into shape***\n\n1. For this step, I used silicone baking mats, but you can also roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring approximately 22\u201d x 14\u201d.\n2. Drop some of the cinnamon roll filling here and there over the rolled out dough. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently spread the filling all over the dough, keeping away from the edges by about a quarter inch.\n3. Starting at a short end (one of the 14\u201d ends), gently but tightly roll the dough into one long roll.\n4. Using a sharp knife (I found that a serrated knife worked best), cut the roll into 12 evenly sliced pieces. \n\n***Second Rising***\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350\u2109.\n2. Place the cut cinnamon rolls into a parchment-lined baking dish, three rows of four.\n3. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes, or until they\u2019ve nearly doubled in size.\n\n***Baking Cinnamon Rolls***\n\n1. Remove the plastic wrap and place baking pan in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 20 \u2013 30 minutes. My cinnamon rolls took 30 minutes to bake, but you should start checking on them after 20 minutes. All ovens are different. The cinnamon rolls will be done when the tops have just lightly browned and the dough sounds hollow when you lightly tap on it with a spoon. The rolls will rise even more while they\u2019re baking and will most likely touch each other. This is fine and good\u2026they\u2019ll stay soft in the middle.\n\n***Icing for Cinnamon Rolls***\n\n1. While the rolls are baking, make the icing. Using either a stand mixer or handheld mixer, blend together cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla until smooth. \n2. When the cinnamon rolls are done baking, let them cool about 5 minutes and add icing to the tops, so it will slightly melt and ooze between the swirls. If you prefer the icing thicker on top, wait until they\u2019ve fully cooled.",

You don't need the head although if you do buy shrimp whole make sure to save the head for stock later.\n\n\u2022 50 grams Sugar White sugar works well here but you can use brown sugar or palm sugar if you prefer. The main job of sugar in this recipe is to provide a bit of sweetness, and to start the caramelization process so the sauce really sticks to the shrimp.\n\n\u2022 1 Onion Finely diced. You can use yellow or sweet onions or even shallots if you like.\n\n\u2022 4 cloves Garlic Finely minced\n\n\u2022 1 Chili Pepper This is optional but does add some nice spice to the shrimp.

My go to for recipes that are cooked as opposed to dipping is Lee Kum Kee Dark Soy Sauce.\n\n\u2022 1\/2 tsp MSG The best option here is Aji No Moto.\n\n\u2022 1\/2 tsp Black Pepper Freshly cracked.\n\n\u2022 50 ml Fish Sauce There are so many brands of fish sauce you can use and I can honestly recommend a dozen different ones. Yet my best recommendation for tom rim would be Nguyen Gia as I believe Phu Quoc island makes some of the absolute best fish sauces in the world, and especially for Vietnamese food.\n\n\u2022 Spring Onion To taste.\n\n\u2022 Cooking Oil As needed. I use sunflower oil most of the time but you can use soy, vegetable, corn, or whatever you prefer. You won't need much, just a tablespoon or two.\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**\n \n1. Use scissors to remove the head and legs from the shrimp. You can optionally remove the tail as well. Place them in a large bowl.\n\n2. Add the rest of the ingredients to the bowl except the cooking oil, fish sauce, and green onion. Give everything a thorough mix and place in the fridge for 15-30 minutes to marinade.\n\n3. Set a pan on medium high heat and add oil. When shimmery reduce to medium and add in the shrimp along with all the marinade. Cook until the sauce is thickened and glossy and sticking to the shells. Add the fish sauce and green onion, toss the pan to coat, and turn off the heat.\nMove shrimp to a serving dish and enjoy with rice or whatever side dish you prefer.",

First of all, try to remove your duck breast from the fridge 1 hour before you start cooking to make sure it will be at room temperature when you pan-sear the duck. Then peel your sweet potatoes and cut them into even-sized cubes. Add to a pan, together with 75 ml of water, 50 grams of butter, and a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a simmer and turn low. Let this simmer for about 25 minutes.\n2. In the meantime, it is time to prepare the sauce. Finely chop the shallot and saute for 2 minutes on medium heat. Add your stock and port wine and reduce by half or until the reduction thickens. Set this aside, clean your mushrooms and finely chop your garlic. Heat your frying pan and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Fry your sage leaves in the oil for about 20-30 seconds or until crispy and put them on a piece of kitchen paper. \n3. Now we are getting there! Preheat your oven to 160 degrees Celsius. Score the fat side of the duck breast (but not too deep) and add it to the already hot pan with the fat side down. Make sure your pan is on medium heat and let the fat render for about 5 minutes or until evenly golden and crispy. Then turn over the duck breast, add a small knob of butter to the pan, and baste your duck for two more minutes. Now add this to an oven dish and continue cooking for about 8 more minutes or until a core temperature of 53 degrees Celsius. \n4. In the meantime, we fry our mushrooms with half of the garlic and a bit of olive oil until nicely golden, add them to an ovenproof dish, and put them in the oven next to the duck. Now add some olive oil the rest of the garlic and your spinach to the pan. Saute until it is fragrant and welted down and set aside. Now you mash your sweet potatoes with a tbsp of cream and salt and pepper to taste. Since we used only a little bit of water, we didn't have to drain them before mashing them to create the ultimate texture and flavor. reheat your port reduction and cut off the heat again, add 50 grams of cold butter and combine with a whisk. \n5. After your duck hits 53 degrees Celsius you let it rest on your counter for about 10 minutes and then we are ready to plate the dish. Start with a layer of your potato puree and add the spinach and mushrooms on top. Slice your duck into 6 pieces and add 3 pieces to both plates (like in the picture). Finish with the sauce and crispy sage leaves and your dish is finished. Enjoy! \ud83c\udf84",

If you are making your stock from scratch, this is where we should start. First clean and rough-chop your vegetables. Add the fishbones and all the vegetables to a large pot and cover with about two liters of water, bring to a simmer and let this simmer on low heat for about 30-40 minutes. In the meantime skim any foam off the pan to create a nice and clear broth. After this 30 minutes simmer, we are going to strain the stock in another pot and put it back on medium-high heat, and continue till the stock is reduced to \u2153 of what you started with. \n2. Now it is time to prepare the sauce. finely chop the shallot and sautee for 2 minutes on medium heat. add 200 ml of white wine and 200 ml of your already reduced stock. let this simmer until reduced by half and then strain out the onions and add your reduction back to the pan. Set this aside for now.\n3. Fill a small pan with water and bring to a boil. Then blanch your asparagus for about two minutes. Drain them and cool them down with cold water. Slice your bacon\/zeeuws spek in thick slices and trim them until they almost have the size of a scallop. \n4. Now it\u2019s time to finish the dish. Put your saucepan on low heat with your reduction. Start with frying your bacon in a dry pan on medium heat until crispy golden brown. let them drain on a piece of kitchen paper and then sear your scallops for two minutes on the first side, so they turn nicely golden brown. On the other side I usually sear a little bit shorter because you don\u2019t want to overcook them; about 60-90 seconds. \n5. Finish the sauce by adding the cream to your warm reduction and simmer for 30 seconds. then turn off the heat and add your cubed cold butter in small batches while whisking and incorporating the butter in the sauce. serve the scallops and bacon on the asparagus. Add the beurre blanc sauce and the chives and flowers as garnish. Enjoy!",

Reduce the heat to medium and add onions to the pan with chorizo and cook for about 5 minutes until they become translucent. Then add bell peppers and mushrooms, cooking until they soften, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n3. Add the Bomba rice to the pan, stirring to ensure it's well coated with the oils and juices.Cook the rice for about 2 minutes until it starts to become translucent. Stir in paprika, turmeric, ground cumin, and a pinch of saffron.\n4. Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Let it simmer gently for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to evenly distribute the heat.\n5. Add the tomato wedges and nestle the king prawns into the rice. Continue to cook for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and cooked through, and the rice is tender. You can cover the pan at this stage with a lid and do not stir it to develop delicious soccarat.\n6. Remove the pan from the heat. Squeeze in the juice of one lime and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan back with a lid and let it rest for 5 minutes.\n7. Sprinkle the paella with chopped parsley for a fresh finish. Serve directly from the pan, ensuring each portion includes some of the delicious socarrat (caramelized and slightly crispy layer of rice that forms at the bottom of the pan)\n\nOriginally posted: [Chorizo &amp; Prawn Paella](https:\/\/chefsbinge.com\/paella-with-prawns-chorizo\/)",

        "recipe_comment":"Check out my beloved recipe for Polish Krokiety, featuring a delectable combination of mushrooms and sauerkraut. This dish is a cherished winter favorite, traditionally prepared for Christmas and perfectly complemented by Polish Beetroot Soup, known as Barszcz Czerwony. Enjoy the rich flavors and hearty warmth it brings. Smacznego!\n\nRead more about the recipe: [Polish Krokiety - Chefs Binge](https:\/\/chefsbinge.com\/polish-krokiety-mushroom-and-sauerkraut-croquettes\/)\n\nThis recipe makes 10 Croquettes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for 10 Pancakes:**\n\n\\* 2.5 cups All-purpose flour - (300g) Plain Flour\n\n\\* 1.7 cups Milk - (400ml)\n\n\\* 0.8 cups Water - (200ml)\n\n\\* 2 Eggs\n\n\\* 1 pinch Salt\n\n\\* Vegetable oil - for frying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for the filling:**\n\n\\* 10.6 oz White mushrooms - (300g)\n\n\\* 3.5 oz Dried wild mushrooms - (100g) Porcini and Boletus\n\n\\* 1.7 lbs Sauerkraut with liquid - (800g)\n\n\\* 3 Onions, medium-size - diced\n\n\\* 3 Bay leaves\n\n\\* 5 All Spice Berries\n\n\\* 1 tsp Sugar\n\n\\* 1 tsp Vegeta seasoning - you can use salt instead\n\n\\* 2 tbsp Vegetable oil\n\n\\* Salt and Pepper to taste\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for panee:**\n\n\\* 2 Eggs\n\n\\* 2 cups Breadcrumbs - (200g)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Cooking Sauerkraut:** Place sauerkraut with the juice in a pot and add enough water to cover it. Include bay leaves and allspice berries. Simmer on low heat until softened, approximately 3-4 hours. Add more liquid as necessary to keep the sauerkraut submerged.\n2. **Preparing Mushrooms:** Place dried wild mushrooms in a glass jug or a small pot. Pour boiling water over them to cover. After 15 minutes, when they are soft, remove and chop them. Reserve the mushroom water for later use, being careful to avoid any sand at the bottom.\n3. **Frying Onions and Mushrooms:** In a frying pan over medium heat, fry onions until they soften but do not brown, about 5 minutes. Then add sliced white mushrooms, increase the heat, and cook until the mushrooms start to brown. Season with Vegeta and black pepper to taste, then remove from the stove.\n4. **Making Pancakes:** Blend all pancake ingredients until a smooth batter forms. Cook pancakes on a medium-sized non-stick frying pan. Pour a small amount of batter into the hot, oiled pan and spread it around by swirling. Once the pancake is set, remove it and place it on a plate. Repeat until all pancakes are made.\n5. **Combining Filling Ingredients:** Once the cabbage is cooked, strain it from the liquid and remove the spices. Let it cool enough to handle, then chop finely. Mix with both the re-hydrated and fried mushrooms and onions. Season with sugar, black pepper, and salt to taste.\n6. **Rolling Krokiety:** Spread about 2 tablespoons of filling inside each pancake. Fold the left and right sides inward, then roll up the pancake.\n7. **Coating Krokiety:** Whisk 2 eggs in a bowl. Dip each krokiet in the egg, then coat with breadcrumbs. Prepared krokiety can be refrigerated for up to three days before frying if needed.\n8. **Preparing for Frying:** Spread about 2 tablespoons of filling inside each pancake. Fold the left and right sides inward, then roll up the pancake.\n9. **Frying Krokiety:** Shallow fry the krokiety in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry for about 3 minutes on each side, using enough oil to cook the sides of the krokiet.\n\nServe the krokiety with Polish beetroot soup (\"Barszcz\") or enjoy them on their own. Smacznego!",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally:** [**Leftover Turkey Soup**](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/leftover-turkey-soup\/)\n\n**Stock (optional to make; can use chicken broth instead):**\n\n* 1 turkey carcass\n* Water\n* Salt\n\n**Soup:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 4 carrots, peeled and diced\n* 4 ribs celery, trimmed and diced\n* 1 fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced\n* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 5 sprigs thyme, bundled together with kitchen twine\n* 6-7 cups prepared stock from above or use chicken broth\n* 4 cups chopped or shredded leftover turkey; use in addition to any meat you pull off the turkey carcass\n* \u00be cup pastina or ditalini\n* 1 lemon, juiced\n* \u00bd cup fresh parsley, minced\n* Big pinch of fennel fronds, minced\n* Crushed red pepper to taste\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Make the stock:**\n\n1. Place the turkey carcass in a large stockpot and cover with 12 cups water. You may need more depending on the size of the carcass. Try your best to immerse the bird with water, but if your pot isn\u2019t big enough, it\u2019s ok if the back bone sticks out a bit. Add a big pinch of salt to the water.\n2. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 2-3 hours. You may wish to flip the bird once during simmering. The liquid should reduce by almost half.\n3. Cover the pot (with foil, if the turkey is sticking out) and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.\n4. The next day, remove the carcass from the stock. Pick off any remaining meat and set it aside in a bowl to be added to the soup. Discard the carcass.\n5. If the stock is very gelatinous, place it on the heat over medium-high just until the gelatin melts, and the stock returns to a liquid. Turn off the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve.\n6. Give the pot a quick rinse and wipe it out. Return it to the stovetop.\n\n**Cook the soup aromatics:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for 8-10 minutes.\n2. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the bundle of thyme.\n\n**Simmer the soup:**\n\n1. Pour in the prepared stock and the chopped turkey. Add salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove and discard the thyme.\n\n**Finish the soup:**\n\n1. Return the soup to a boil. Add the pastina and cook for 3-4 minutes. Taste and add salt and pepper.\n2. Finish the soup by adding parsley, fennel fronds, and lemon juice.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with lemon wedges and minced parsley on the side. Enjoy!",

        "recipe_comment":"**Ingredients:**\n\n* 400 gram white rice (left-over or freshly cooked)\n* 50 gram carrot\n* 100 gram pointed cabbage\n* 150 gram leek\n* \u00bd tsp turmeric powder\n* 2 tsp cumin powder\n* 1 tsp cilantro powder\n* 50 gram ginger (grated), or 1 tsp ginger powder\n* 2 tbsp neutral oil\n* 1 onion\n* small bunch (10g) of celery leaf\n* 2 cloves of garlic\n* 3 tbsp Kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce)\n* 1 tbsp sambal to taste (Indonesian chilli sauce) (optional)\n* 1 tsp trassi (fermented shrimp paste) (optional)\n* Condiments to serve:\n* Prawn crackers\n* Atjar tjampoer (mixed pickled vegetable)\n* Sambal (Indonesian chilli sauce)\n* 4 eggs, sunny side up\n* Sliced cucumber\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. Cook your rice a minute shorter than what the packaging states. If using freshly cooked rice, spread it out on a tray to cool slightly. If you are using leftover rice - that's even better - break up any clumps.\n2. Cut the leek in half and slice into rings of 1 cm. Dice the carrot, and cut the pointed cabbage and onion. If you use other vegetables, or left-over vegetables, cut them in bite-sized pieces as well. You can basically use any vegetable you like.\n3. Gather the spices: turmeric, ginger, cilantro, cumin, garlic. Chop the shrimp paste, this is optionally. And grab your sambal.\n4. Heat a large pan or wok over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of neutral oil and saut\u00e9 the onion until fragrant and translucent.\n5. Turn your wok down to low heat. Add the spices, the shrimp paste and the sambal to the wok. If using sambal, adjust the amount according to your desired level of spiciness. Wok for 3 minutes.\n6. Add the vegetables to the wok. Heat your wok over medium heat. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened.\n7. Add 1\/3 of the cooked rice to the wok. And then add the kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce). Use a spatula to break up any clumps and mix the rice with the vegetables and spices.\n8. Add the other 2\/3 of the cooked rice and the chopped celery leaves. Continue stir-frying the rice for about 5 more minutes until all the rice has turned brown and yellowish. Optionally you can now make a sunny side up egg in another pan. I really like a sunny side up egg as a condiment to this nasi goreng recipe.\n9. Remove your nasi goreng from heat and serve on the plate with condiments such as: prawn crackers, store-bought atjar tjampoer (mixed pickled vegetables), sambal (Indonesian chili sauce), and your sunny side up egg.Selamat makan!

Cut the beef into slices. Sprinkle with baking soda, stir and leave for 15-20 minutes.\r\n2. Slice the carrots, bell pepper and cucumber. Do not stir. Slice the onion feathers. Finely chop the chili peppers. Set aside.\r\n3. In a little oil, fry the carrots for 1 to 1.5 minute over high heat. Then similarly fry the bell pepper.\r\n4. Rinse the beef several times in cold water. Transfer to a paper towel and remove excess water.\r\n5. Heat a skillet well over a heat just below high. Add vegetable oil. Place the meat and do not stir until it has set. After that you can stir. Cook for 5-7 minutes.\r\n6. For the dressing, mix together: scallion, chili pepper, garlic, sesame seeds, sesame oil and paprika. Pour in the boiling vegetable oil. Then add soy sauce, rice vinegar, salt and sugar.\r\n7. Cook the glass noodles according to the recipe on the package. In my case, pour boiling water over it and leave it for 5-7 minutes. Afterward, drain the water.\r\n8. Transfer the glass noodles to a salad bowl. If desired, cut with scissors. Add the roasted carrots and bell pepper, cucumber, beef and pour the dressing over them. Mix well.\n\nThis salad took me about 25 minutes to make. It's best to eat it right away because it tastes better when it's warm. It will keep in the refrigerator for about 2-3 days.",

While I\u2019ve received many lessons on how to stew chicken throughout my life, none of them came with amounts.\n\nHowever I\u2019m going to break the cycle here and offer a recipe you can depend on to create an amazing pot of stew chicken.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 whole chicken *(cleaned and cut into bite size pieces)*\n* 12 pimentos peppers *(seasoning peppers)*\n* 12 cloves garlic\n* 6 bundles chadon beni *(culantro\/sawtooth coriander)*\n* 1\/4 cup brown sugar\n* 1 tbsp tomato paste\n* 2 tbsp roucou *(annatto extract) or 1 tsp annatto powder*\n* 1 bay leaf\n* A few dashes of Angostura Aromatic Bitters\n* 1 cup coconut milk\n* 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n* salt &amp; black pepper *(to taste)*\n\n**Making The Green Seasoning**\n\n1. Place shadon beni, garlic and pimento into a food processor then grind until a smooth paste is formed\n\n**Seasoning The Chicken**\n\n1. Place chicken in a bowl then add 3 to 4 tbsp of green seasoning.\n2. Add 4 to 5 liberal dashes of Angostura Aromatic Bitters.\n3. Season with salt &amp; black pepper to taste.\n4. Marinate for at least one hour. For best results, marinate overnight.\n\n**Stewing The Chicken**\n\n1. Allow the seasoning chicken to thaw to room temperature.\n2. Add oil to a pot then add brown sugar.\n3. Allow the sugar to start to melt then start stirring the oil and sugar to incorporate air into the mixture using a wooden or silicon spoon.\n4. Continue to stir until the brown sugar mixture gets frothy then turns from light brown to dark brown.\n5. Add seasoned chicken to the pot then toss to ensure each piece of chicken gets coated with the caramelized sugar.\n6. Once all pieces are coated, cover and allow to cook for 5 to 8 minutes on medium\/low heat.\n7. Add 4 to 5 dashes of Angostura Aromatic Bitters to the pot.\n8. Add roucou, bayleaf, tomato paste and coconut milk to the pot.\n9. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.\n10. Reduce heat to low then cover chicken and allow to cook for 10 to 12 minutes.\n11.

Turn the heat on the broth to medium and low boil for 20 minutes or until the liquid reduces to about 8 cups. Strain the broth through a sieve into a large bowl. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.\n3. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bird and shred or dice it into bite-sized pieces. Reserve the skin for another use (like snacking on it or frying it up for a crispy garnish) and reserve the carcass for stock if you like.\n\n**Start the soup:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook for 8\u201310 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\n2.

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally:** [**Wine-Braised Beef Short Ribs**](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/wine-braised-beef-short-ribs\/)\n\n**Short ribs:**\n\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 2 pounds boneless beef short ribs\n* 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n* 2 cups low-sodium beef stock\n* 3 cups Cabernet Sauvignon or similar full-bodied red wine\n* 10 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly crushed\n* 2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Parmesan mashed potatoes:**\n\n* 4 large Yukon gold potatoes, about 1\u00bd pounds\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* \u2153 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\n* \u2153 cup heavy cream or whole milk\n* 2 tablespoons chives, minced\n* Salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika to taste\n\n**Prepare the short ribs:**\n\n1. Pat the beef dry and season with salt and pepper.\n2. In a large, wide pot, heat the oil over medium-high until hot. Add the short ribs in an even layer and cook without moving for 3 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 2-3 minutes per side until browned all over. Remove from the pot. Turn the heat to medium.\n3. Add the garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and, using the back of your spoon, gently press the paste into any browned bits left in the bottom of the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes until the paste deepens in color.\n4. Pour in the red wine and lift up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the beef stock. Bring to a boil. Add the beef short ribs back to the pot and reduce heat to a low simmer. Simmer, covered, for 3 hours. Taste and season.\n5. Remove and discard the garlic cloves. Skim off as much fat from the top as you can. If you can refrigerate the short ribs overnight, you can remove the fat the next day before proceeding with the recipe. If you don't want to wait, just skim off what you can while it's still warm and proceed with the recipe as-is.\n\n**Finish the sauce:**\n\n1. Remove the ribs from the broth and bring the broth to a rapid simmer over medium-low. Cook for 25 minutes until the broth reduces by half and thickens. Mount the cold butter into the sauce, whisking to incorporate until glossy. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n2. Using your fork, tear the ribs into large pieces.

Boil for 20-25 minutes until fork-tender.\n2. Drain the potatoes and return them to the warm pot. Allow any residual water to evaporate for 5 minutes. You can turn the heat to low to speed up this process.\n3. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl with the butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and heavy cream. Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes until they reach your desired consistency. Add the chives, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and paprika, and mash to incorporate. If the potatoes seem dry, add a few more splashes of heavy cream.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the potatoes between plates. Add a few pieces of the beef on top and drizzle the sauce all over.

        "recipe_comment":"Check out my Al Pastor Recipe for Tacos. This homemade version of pork &amp; pineapple tacos is prepared with grilled tenderloin to get the result similar to traditionally used rotisserie, very quick in preparation and absolutely delicious.\r  \n\r  \nThe taco meat recipe includes the use of chipotle paste. However, if you have any traditional Mexican dried chilies like guajillo or ancho chilies, you can incorporate them into the marinade by rehydrating them, removing the seeds, and blending them into a paste.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for Al Pastor:**\n\n\\* 1 lbs Pork tenderloin - (450g) thinly sliced\n\n\\* 2 slices Pineapple - finely chopped\n\n\\* 1 Onion, medium size - cut in half and sliced\n\n\\* 1 Red bell pepper - sliced\n\n\\* 5 Garlic cloves - minced\n\n\\* 2 tsp Chipotle paste - (Instead you can use traditional Mexican dried chilies like guajillo or ancho chilies, rehydrate and use in the marinade)\n\n\\* 2 tbsp Vegetable oil\n\n\\* \u00bd tsp Salt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for Al Pastor spice blend:**\n\n\\* 1 tbsp Paprika\n\n\\* 1 tbsp Ground cumin\n\n\\* 1 tsp Epazote - (optional)\n\n\\* 1 tsp Oregano\n\n\\* \u00bd tsp Black pepper\n\n\\* 1 tsp Annatto seeds - (you can use achiote paste to marinate pork instead)\n\n\\* 2 Cloves\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**To serve:**\n\n\\* 12 Small corn taco tortillas\n\n\\* Salsa\n\n\\* Guacamole\n\n\\* Pickled Red Jalape\u00f1o &amp; Pineapple\n\n\\* 1 handful Fresh coriander - (cilantro)\n\n\\* Cheese - Choose: Oaxaca, Cheddar, Queso Fresco, Mozzarella.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a spice grinder, combine paprika, cumin, epazote (if using), oregano, black pepper, annatto seeds, and cloves. Grind into a fine powder.\n2. In a large bowl, combine the spice blend, minced garlic, half of the vegetable oil, chopped pineapple and salt. Add the thinly sliced pork tenderloin and toss until the pork is well-coated with the marinade. (While refrigerating overnight will enhance the flavour, it's not a necessary step.).\n3. Preheat your grill to 460\u00b0F (240\u00b0C). Place the marinated pork on a tray and grill for about 12-15 minutes or until the pork is cooked through and has a slightly charred exterior. Go to another step while waiting for pork.\n4. In a large skillet, heat the remaining vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Saut\u00e9 the onion and red bell pepper until they are soft and slightly caramelized, about 5-7 minutes. Then add a splash of water, cover with a lid, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for another 5 minutes.\n5. Add grilled pork to the skillet with the saut\u00e9ed vegetables. Add 2 tsp of chipotle paste to the mixture, tossing everything together well to ensure the flavours meld. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on medium heat, stirring occasionally.\n6. Warm the taco tortillas in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side or until they are soft and pliable. To serve, place a few slices of pork and vegetable mixture on each tortilla. Top with your choice of salsa, guacamole, pickled red jalape\u00f1o &amp; pineapple, fresh coriander, and cheese. Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade Al Pastor tacos!\n\nBlog post\/print: [Tacos Al Pastor](https:\/\/chefsbinge.com\/)",

Cook each flatbread until golden-brown spots appear, pressing gently to encourage puffing. Make sure to turn it over constantly while cooking.\n8. Keep the cooked bazlama warm under a cloth. You can spread the melted butter with fresh chopped parsley while the bazlama is hot.\n9. Serve warm with dips, spreads, or alongside main dishes.",

Simmer for 10\u201315 minutes or until the broth reduces and darkens a bit in color. You should be left with about 5\u20136 cups of broth.\n3. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the spent onion. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.\n\n**Prepare the chicken:**\n\n1. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, carefully pick the meat from the bones and shred it with two forks or your fingers.\n2. Discard the bones and skin. You can also dice the cooked skin and air-fry or pan-fry it to make a crunchy garnish for the soup if you like.\n\n**Cook the mushrooms:**\n\n1. Turn the heat on the pot to medium.

Stir in the chicken. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Cook the rice:**\n\n1. Return the soup to a boil. Stir in the rice and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes or until the rice is tender. Add another cup or two of water if the rice absorbs too much liquid. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.\n\n**Finish the soup:**\n\n1. Add the lemon juice and spinach. Simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the soup into bowls.

Preheat the oven to 450\u00b0F \/ 230\u00b0C . If using a cast iron skillet, add 1 Tbsp Shortening and place it in the oven to preheat.\r\n2. Whisk together 2 cups Flour, all-purpose, 1 Tbsp Baking powder, 1\/2 tsp Baking soda, and 1 tsp Salt, fine sea in a large mixing bowl. Note: If you are using milk instead of buttermilk, leave out the baking soda. Baking soda reacts with the acid in the buttermilk to help with leavening, if milk is used then it is not needed.\r\n3. Cut \u00bc cup Butter, unsalted into cubes then using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour mixture. If you do not have a pastry blender you can either use two knives and slash them against each other, use your hands to squish the butter or if you have a food processor you can pulse it a few times.\r\n4. Gradually add 1 cup Buttermilk (or milk) to the dry ingredients, if using milk you will need less of it since it isn't as thick. Depending on your environment, you may not need all of the buttermilk or you may need a bit more. The dough should be sticky but not too wet that you cannot handle it. If it becomes too sticky, simply add a bit more flour.\r\n5. Dust a clean, flat surface with some flour and scoop out the dough. Sprinkle some flour on it then using your hands, knead a few times into a ball then fold the dough over itself 2 \u2013 3 times.\r\n6. Pat the dough to about an \u00bd-inch in thickness. The thicker the dough, the higher the biscuits will be so feel free to adjust to your preference, you will just end up with more or less biscuits depending on thickness.\r\n7. Cut the biscuits out with a biscuit cutter, cookie cutter or a cleaned out empty can. Set the biscuits aside.\r\n8. Take the dough scraps, knead them together, pat it out, and cut out some more biscuits. You should end up with 8-9 biscuits.\r\n9. Once they are all cut, remove the cast iron skillet from the oven and carefully place each biscuit into the hot oil (if using). Carefully flip over each biscuit so both sides are coated in oil, this will ensure both sides get browned. You want to place them closer together but not touching. As they start to expand, they will be forced to expand upwards instead of outwards.\r\n10. Carefully place the pan back into the oven and bake for 10 minutes.\r\n11. Check to see if they are golden brown and if so then remove from the oven. If they need more time, rotate the pan and keep an eye on them as they should be ready to pull within a few minutes.",

Start by bringing a pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles for 5-7 minutes per package instructions. In the meantime, prepare a strainer and an ice bath. \n2. Once the noodles are cooked, immediately strain and add to the ice bath. Agitate and gently scrub the noodles in the bowl to remove any excess starch (prevents them from sticking together; especially important if you're meal-prepping this dish).\n3. Make the sauce by combining the dashi, 1\/4 cup of soy sauce, mirin, grated ginger, and green onion. If you don't have time to make dashi, you can use HonDashi which is like a dashi base. Just combine 1 teaspoon of the HonDashi with 1 cup of boiling water &amp; stir. \n4. Cook the broccoli in a pan over medium-high heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring often. Add in the garlic and toss for about a minute. Set aside. \n5. Wipe out the pan and over high heat, add a drizzle of neutral oil. Toss in the cleaned shrimp and stir fry for 3-5 minutes depending on the size of the shrimp. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and cook for another minute. Pepper to taste.\n6. Plate the noodles, shrimp, broccoli, and garnishes &amp; serve the dipping sauce in a small bowl. And enjoy!",

To prevent them from browning, immerse the diced apples in water mixed with some of the lemon juice.\n\n\n2. **Cooking:** In a large pot, combine the apple dices, sugar, lemon zest, remaining lemon juice, cinnamon, fresh ginger, nutmeg, and water.\n\n\n3. **Boiling:** Bring the mixture to a boil on high heat. Once it's boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer. Cook until the apples are soft and mushy.\n\n\n4. **Blending:** If you like a smoother texture, blend the mixture (an immersion blender works great here). I used a regular blender though. \n\n\n5. **Final Boil:** Transfer the blended mix (or keep it in the same pot if you used an immersion blender) and bring it to a boil once more. Then, reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer until it thickens.\n\n\n6. **Testing:** To check its readiness, place a little jam on a plate and draw a line through with your finger. If it maintains the separation and doesn\u2019t run, it\u2019s ready!\n\n\n7. **Storage:** Sterilize your glass containers by boiling them. For the lids, a trick I learned is to clean them with vodka. Pour the hot jam into the jars, seal them, and let them cool to room temperature.\n\n\nServe it on bread, muffins, or even as a topping for desserts. The fresh ginger gives it a nice kick, and the blend of spices makes it taste like autumn in a jar! \ud83c\udf41\n\nHope you enjoy it as much as I did! If you give it a go, please share your results.",

The batter will still be quite wet when it's all mixed, and this is to be expected.\n* Using an ice cream scoop, spoon out portions of dough and place on a parchment lined baking sheet, about 1 inch apart. I found it helpful to scoop the batter with the ice cream scoop, and hold a smaller spoon in the other hand, to help nudge the sticky batter onto the baking sheet.\n* Bake on the center rack of the oven for about 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly dry and the center springs back when lightly touched.\n* Let the cookies cool completely on a wire rack.\n\n***Making the cream cheese filling***\n\n* To make this filling, you should use either a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or a handheld electric mixer.\n* Place the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla extract into a bowl and mix until creamy, about one minute.\n* Then, add the powdered sugar one cup at a time, mixing each time until smooth.\n\n***Adding the filling to the cookies***\n\n* Once the cookies have completely cooled, you're ready to add the filling.\n* You can either spread the filling with a spoon or butter knife, or pipe it on using a piping bag...the choice is yours.\n* Turn one cookie upside down and spread an even layer of filling across it, as thin or as thick as your heart desires! I prefer somewhere between a quarter- and a half-inch of filling.\n* Then, gently place a similar size cookie on top of the filling.\n* Let chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving (if you have the willpower to wait!).\n* All that's left to do is enjoy your own homemade pumpkin whoopie pies!",

        "recipe_comment":"Check out my cherished family recipe for Polish Potato Pancakes (Placki Ziemniaczane) This is among my favourite potato dishes, ideal when paired with a savoury sauce or enjoyed by itself.  \nMy love for potato pancakes was inherited from my grandfather. Whenever I visited his farm, he would prepare these large pancakes using potatoes he\u2019d grown himself. We would binge on them together, savouring every bite. Those moments really stuck with me, and I\u2019ve loved them ever since. I was hooked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n\\* 2.2 lbs Large Starchy Potatoes - (1kg or 4-5 large potatoes) Russet, Yukon Gold or other floury variety.\n\n\\* 1 Medium Onion\n\n\\* 3 Garlic Cloves\n\n\\* 1 Egg\n\n\\* 2-3 tbsp All-Purpose Flour - (Plain Flour)\n\n\\* \u00be cup Vegetable Oil - (200ml) for shallow frying\n\n\\* 1-2 tsp Salt\n\n\\* Black Pepper - to taste\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**1.** Grate the peeled potatoes using the large holes of a grater. For the onion and garlic, you can mince them using a food processor. Then, add them to the grated potatoes.\n\n**2.** Place the grated potato, onion, and garlic mixture into a fine mesh strainer or cheese cloth, and squeeze out as much liquid as you can. This step ensures the pancakes become crispier. (keep the liquid, read the recipe notes)\n\n**3.** Transfer the strained mixture to a large bowl. Add the egg, flour, salt, and pepper. Mix well until everything is thoroughly combined.\n\n**4.** In a large frying pan, heat half of the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, take a two spoonful of the potato mixture, flatten it into a pancake shape in the hot oil. 5.\n\n**5.** Fry each side until golden brown and crispy, roughly 2-3 minutes per side (You may need to add more oil later).\n\n**6.** After frying, place the pancakes on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.\n\n**7.** Serve the potato pancakes while hot. They pair wonderfully with sour cream or your favourite sauce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes:**\n\n**Best Potatoes for Latkes:** Starchy potatoes, like Russet or Yukon Gold, are ideal for this recipe as they yield a crispier pancake.\n\nBatter Consistency: Ensure the consistency of the batter is thick enough to hold together. If it seems too wet, you can add a bit more flour. Conversely, if it feels too dry, consider adding another egg.\n\n**Potato Starch:** After squeezing the water from the grated potatoes, don\u2019t discard the liquid immediately. Let it settle for a moment. At the bottom of the bowl, you\u2019ll notice some potato starch sediment. This is pure potato starch, and you can carefully pour off the water and then add this starch back into your potato mixture. It can enhance the texture of the pancakes and make them more cohesive.\n\n**Pancake Size:** The size of your potato pancakes can vary based on how you intend to serve them. You can opt for smaller or larger sizes. My grandfather, for instance, used to make them as large as the entire pan! \ud83d\ude42\n\nOriginally posted: [Polish Potato Pancakes - ChefsBinge](https:\/\/chefsbinge.com\/polish-potato-pancakes-placki-ziemniaczane\/)",

Bake sweet potatoes in the air fryer at 180\u00b0C (356\u00b0F) for 15 minutes, flipping occasionally.  \n2. In a bowl, mix the chickpeas with 5 or 6 cloves of garlic, a bit of chili oil, some olive oil, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Put them in the air fryer rack next to the sweet potatoes. After the first 15 minutes of cooking are finished, bake them together with the chickpeas at 200\u00b0C (392\u00b0F) for another 15-20 minutes until fork tender, depending on the size of the sweet potatoes.\n3. While the potatoes and chickpeas are cooking, saut\u00e9 the mushrooms in a pan with the remaining garlic and a little olive oil.\n4. Make a big and deep cut along the potato lengthwise while it is still hot without cutting off the ends. Sprinkle some truffle salt, truffle oil and 2-3 cloves of air fryed garlics (which you put with chickpeas) then insert a fork into the slit and mash the soft potato and mix it with ingredients. Be careful not to damage the skin.\n5. Combine cr\u00e8me cheese, chickpeas, mushrooms, sprinkle a pinch of sesame seed and cucumbers inside the sweet potatoes. Grate some parmesan and ready to dig in!\n\n# Chili Oil\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 4-5 dried chilli pepper, halved\n* 1 cup of olive oil\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1.  Pour the oil and peppers in a small pan and heat the oil on low heat to 100\u00b0C (212\u00b0F), without boiling.\n2. Heat the oil in this way for 5 minutes, then turn the heat off and leave it to cooldown. Transfer to a light-proof bottle or tin  and use it whenever you want. For the oil to last long, I recommend you keep it in a cool place away from sunlight.\n\n# Truffle Salt\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*For medium truffle flavour;*\n\n* 200 g coarse sea or rock salt\n* 20 ml truffle oil\n\n*For high truffle flavour;*\n\n* 4-5 tablespoons coarse sea or rock salt\n* A coupe tablespoons truffle oil\n\n**Directions:**\n\n1. Blend them together in a food processor.",

        "recipe_comment":"Ingredients for the Apple Cider Glaze :\r  \n1 cup apple cider\r  \n2 fresh apples, peeled, cored, and chopped\r  \n2 tablespoons olive oil\r  \n1 tablespoon minced garlic\r  \n1 sprig of fresh rosemary\r  \n2 sprigs of fresh thyme\r  \nSalt and pepper to taste\r  \nIngredients for Apple Cider Glazed Chicken:\r  \n1 whole halal chicken (3-4 pounds)\r  \n2 cups apple cider\r  \n1\/2 cup apple cider vinegar\r  \n1\/4 cup olive oil\r  \n1\/4 cup brown sugar\r  \n3 cloves garlic, minced\r  \n2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\r  \n1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped\r  \n1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves\r  \n1 teaspoon chopped sage\r  \nSalt and black pepper to taste\r  \nFresh herbs and lemon slices for garnish\r  \nApple Cider glaze to pour on the chicken\r  \nSpecific Kitchen Tools and Appliances:\r  \nRoasting Pan: A sturdy roasting pan with a rack is essential for even cooking and proper air circulation around the chicken.\r  \nBasting Brush: This tool will come in handy for applying the apple cider glaze throughout the roasting process.\r  \nMeat Thermometer: To ensure your chicken is perfectly cooked, invest in a meat thermometer. It takes the guesswork out of determining when your chicken is done, ensuring it\u2019s safe to eat without overcooking.\r  \nKitchen Twine: If your chicken isn\u2019t pre-trussed, you\u2019ll need kitchen twine to secure the legs and wings, ensuring even cooking.\r  \nInstructions for the Apple Cider Glaze:\r  \nSimmer the Apple Cider: In a saucepan over medium heat, pour in the apple cider. Bring it to a gentle simmer and let it cook until it reduces by half. This will intensify the apple flavor and sweetness. It should take about 15-20 minutes.\r  \nSaut\u00e9 the Aromatics: In another saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut\u00e9 for a minute or until it becomes fragrant.\r  \nAdd the Chopped Apples: Toss in the chopped apples and saut\u00e9 for about 3-4 minutes until they begin to soften.\r  \nCombine with Reduced Cider: Pour the reduced apple cider into the saucepan with the apples. Stir to combine all the ingredients.\r  \nAdd Fresh Herbs: Place the fresh rosemary and thyme sprigs into the mixture. These aromatic herbs will infuse the glaze with delightful flavors.\r  \nSimmer and Reduce: Let the glaze simmer over medium-low heat for an additional 10-15 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld, and the glaze should thicken slightly. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\r  \nStrain and Cool: Once the glaze has reached your desired consistency, remove it from the heat. Using a fine mesh strainer, strain the glaze into a bowl to remove the solid pieces, leaving behind a smooth, velvety glaze. Let it cool to room temperature.\r  \nInstructions for the Apple Cider Glazed Chicken:\r  \nPreheat the Oven:\r  \nPreheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\r  \nPrepare the Chicken:\r  \nRemove the giblets and any excess fat from the chicken cavity.\r  \nRinse the chicken inside and out with cold water. Pat it dry with paper towels.\r  \nMarinate the Chicken:\r  \nIn a bowl, whisk together the apple cider, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, brown sugar, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, chopped rosemary, chopped thyme, salt, and black pepper.\r  \nPlace the chicken in a large resealable plastic bag or a deep dish.\r  \nPour the apple cider marinade over the chicken.\r  \nSeal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight, turning the chicken occasionally.\r  \nTruss the Chicken:\r  \nIf desired, truss the chicken by tying the legs together with kitchen twine to help it cook evenly.\r  \nBasting and Roasting:\r  \nPlace the marinated chicken on a rack in a roasting pan.\r  \nBrush the chicken with some of the apple cider glaze.\r  \nRoast in the preheated oven for approximately 20 minutes per pound (450g) or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\r  \nBaste the chicken with the apple cider glaze every 20-30 minutes during roasting.\r  \nCrisp Up the Skin:\r  \nDuring the last 15 minutes of roasting, increase the oven temperature to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C) to help crisp up the chicken\u2019s skin. Monitor it to prevent excessive browning.\r  \nRest and Serve:\r  \nOnce the chicken reaches the desired temperature and has a golden-brown, crispy skin, remove it from the oven.\r  \nTent the chicken loosely with aluminum foil and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving.\r  \nCarve and Garnish:\r  \nGlaze with the Apple Cider Glaze.\r  \nCarve the chicken into serving pieces, such as thighs, drumsticks, and breast slices.\r  \nGarnish with fresh herbs and citrus slices if desired.",

If it is just a snack\u2026be prepared to share haha. Typically grape leaves are used so follow your heart ppl. I like it extra ~fresh~. \n\nIngredients:\n\n\u2022 1 cup rice rinsed (using jasmine here bc that is what I had on hand but short grain is ideal)\n\n\u2022  1ish 2 ish cups vegetable broth\u00a0\n\n\u2022  1 yellow onion minced\n\n\u2022 2 garlic cloves minced\n\n\u2022  1 tbsp lemon zest\n\n\u2022 Juice from 3 lemons\n\n\u2022 \u00bc cup pinenuts (roasted on parchment paper at 350 for 5-7 minutes, get it slightly golden)\n\n\u2022  \u2153 cup minced dill\n\n\u2022 \u00bc cup minced parsley\n\n\u2022  2 bundles swiss chard leaves. Could be rainbow, green, red\u2026doesn\u2019t matter hehe.\n\n\u2022  Salt and pepper to taste.\u00a0\n\nDirections:\n1. First we are going to blanch the swiss chard. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and then in batches submerge the swiss chard. It is just for a quick dip and then take them out. Rinsing under cold water when done or can place them in an ice bath if you prefer. Then destem and set aside.\u00a0\n2. Next we are going to parboil the rice. Over medium heat saute onion until slightly browned. Add just a splash of water to prevent sticking and leave undisturbed for a few minutes and str. About 5-7 minutes. Adding more water as needed through the process. Then add garlic allowing this to get fragrant. About 30 seconds. Stir in the rice, \u00bd cup veg broth, and juice of 1 lemon. Bring to a boil then lowering to simmer covered for about 8 to 10 minutes or until liquids are absorbed. You can check on it every so often and stir. Take off heat uncovered and allow to cool.\u00a0\n3. Once cooled stir in herbs, lemon zest, and pine nuts. At this point season to taste with salt and pepper and anything else. Want it more herby? Add more herbs. Or to infuse more flavor add some dried dill\/parsley along with it. Want it more lemony? Add more zest. The world is your oyster.\u00a0\n4. Time to fill these puppies up. For each side leaf of the swiss chard you can tear these into square like pieces like in the video. Add about a spoonful of the rice filling in the center horizontally, then you roll it up like a little burrito. So fold the sides in and then roll forward. Can use my video as a visual reference. Set aside seam side down as you do your thing with the remainder.\u00a0\n5. For any scraps leftover with your chard leaves you can line the bottom of a pan with it to prevent sticking. Now one by one, add in your dolmades seam side down. I go in a circle until the bottom is filled and add any extras on top. Squeeze the juice of 2 lemons over it. Then fill with veg broth until the dolmades are about halfway covered. About 1 \u00bc cup to 1 \u00bd cups. Bring to a simmer over medium heat then lowering to low\/simmer. Cover and let it simmer for 45 minutes to an hour. Basically until the liquid is almost all absorbed and your dolmades are soft\/rice is tender.\u00a0\n6. Take off heat and let cool! Serve it up and have the time of your life!! Can eat it alongside some cucumbers and olives. Allll dipped into some baba ganoush or dip of choice. They taste even more magical the next day when they\u2019ve had a chance to sit in the fridge overnight.\u00a0",

Preheat the oven to 205\u00b0C\/400\u00b0F.\n2. In a large bowl, whisk together the\u00a0**flour**,\u00a0**baking powder**,\u00a0**salt**,\u00a0**black pepper**,\u00a0**crushed dried chilies**, and\u00a0**chili flakes**.\n3. Cut the\u00a0**butter**\u00a0into cubes, then rub it into the flour mixture using your finger tips. Continue until the pieces of butter are pea-sized or smaller, and evenly distributed throughout. Sprinkle in all of the\u00a0**chopped herbs**\u00a0and 100g of the **grated\u00a0cheese**. Mix again until well combined.\n4. Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in 100g of\u00a0**cream**. Stir through the **dijon\u00a0mustard**, then combine the dry and wet ingredients until you arrive at a soft-but-firm dough that just comes together when pressed in your hand. If necessary, add up to 20g more of cream \u2014 a good way to do this is to remove the well-formed dough from the bowl and add liquid only to the dry crumbs remaining at the bottom, bit by bit. This enables you to hydrate only the parts of the mixture that need it, and avoids over-moistening the already-ready parts of the dough.\n5. Tip the mixture out onto a lightly floured surface and use the palm of your hand as little as you can to pat it out into a rough circle, about 2cm\/\u00bein thick. Using a lightly floured 5.5cm\/2\u2033 wide glass or biscuit cutter, cut out 9 or so scones, reforming the dough into a rough disk as needed in between rounds of cutting.\n6. At this point, if you have room in your fridge or freezer, place the scones on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and transfer them to either to cool. In the meantime, bring a small pan of salted water to a boil. Pop in your reserved\u00a0**sage leaves**\u00a0for 30-45 seconds, just long enough to blanch them, then transfer them to a plate lined with a dish towel and pat them dry. Doing this will help prevent the leaves from shrivelling up too much and burning in the oven while the scones bake. At this point you may also want to brush each sage leaf with a bit of\u00a0**olive oil**, although you don\u2019t have to \u2014 it\u2019ll make the leaves extra crisp.\n7. Remove the scones from the fridge or freezer if you left them to chill. Brush each scone top with a bit of\u00a0**cream**, then sprinkle the **remaining\u00a0cheese**\u00a0evenly over each scone, and top each one with a\u00a0**sage leaf**.\u00a0\n8. Bake for 17 minutes or so (every oven is different!), or until the scones have well risen and their cheesy tops look crisp and golden. Once out of the oven, they should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Serve immediately, or enjoy for up to 4 days post-bake: simply store in an airtight container at room temperature and reheat in the oven before savouring again.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n**Notes:**\u00a0When it comes to scones, you want to keep the butter cold until the very end to maximise the level of flakiness in your finished bake. One way to do this is to chill the butter before you combine it with the other ingredients, and then, once shaped, to chill the unbaked scones once more just before placing them in the oven.\u00a0[For more tips and details, feel free to check out the whole post here](https:\/\/www.allo-simone.com\/recipes-en\/savoury-sage-scones\/) :)",

Set aside.\n* Leave the skin on the remaining half of the kabocha and cut it into 2\u201d cubes. Set aside.\n\n**Prepare the soup base:**\n\n* Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon avocado oil in a large pot. Add the onion and cook for 7 minutes until it softens. Add the peeled kabocha cubes to the onion and cook for 3\u20135 minutes until it begins to turn golden brown. Season with salt and pepper.\n* Melt the butter into the pot and add the chili oil and sesame oil. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20\u201330 minutes until completely soft. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Cook the squash seeds:**\n\n* As the broth simmers, prepare the seeds. Rinse the warm seeds under water and remove the stringy bits of kabocha from them. Pat the seeds dry and arrange on the same baking sheet used for the kabocha. Add more oil, if needed.\n* Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the oven for 10 minutes, flipping once midway through. Remove from the oven once the seeds are golden brown and crispy. Set aside.\n\n**Cook the rice:**\n\n* Once the kabocha is very tender, mash it with a potato masher or use an immersion blender to blend until completely smooth. Add the rice and the skin-on kabocha and season with salt. Keep the heat on low and simmer for 30 minutes or until the kabocha cubes and rice are very tender. Add more water as necessary if the liquid evaporates too quickly. Stir the soup regularly to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Taste and season again to your preferences.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n* Ladle the rice soup into bowls and pile a few pieces of skin-on kabocha on top. Garnish with more chili and sesame oil, a sprinkle of shichimi togarashi, and a few microgreens. Sprinkle the crispy kabocha seeds on top.

Place the milk, cream, half the sugar, vanilla pod &amp; salt into a medium sized saucepan. Set over a low heat &amp; warm until steaming (don't boil!).\n2. In the meantime, add the egg yolks, remaining sugar, milk powder &amp; cornflour into a heatproof mixing bowl &amp; whisk to combine.\n3. Pour a third of the warm milk into the yolks &amp; whisk them together.\n4.  Pour the tempered yolks into the pan of remaining milk &amp; cook over a low heat until thickened &amp; has reached a temperature of 82\u00b0c. Make sure to stir the custard constantly with a rubber spatula to stop it from catching. 5. Pass the custard into a jug, through a sieve then serve immediately.\n\n**Toffee Sauce**\n\n1. Place the cream, sugar, butter &amp; golden syrup into a medium sized saucepan then place over a low heat.\n2. Cook until the butter has melted &amp; the sugar has dissolved then increase the heat &amp; bring to the boil. Cook for 2-3 minutes then remove from the heat &amp; stir in the vanilla &amp; salt.

Set aside in the fridge until ready to use.\n\n**The Sponge**\n\n1. Preheat an oven to 170\u00b0c\/150\u00b0c fan (340\u00b0f\/300\u00b0f fan).\n2. Chop the dates into small pieces &amp; place into a bowl with the bicarbonate of soda &amp; boiling water. Leave to soak for 10-15 minutes then blitz with a stick blender\/food processor until smooth.\n3. In the meantime, sift together the flour, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon &amp; salt. Set aside.\n4. Place the softened butter &amp; sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer then use the paddle attachment to beat until light &amp; fluffy. This will take at least 5 minutes on a medium speed.\n5. Next, mix in the egg, followed by the black treacle.\n6. Add in half of the flour &amp; half of the date puree &amp; mix until just combined.\n7. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula then add in the remaining flour, dates &amp; the sour cream. Mix until just combined.\n8. Transfer the cake batter into a large jug then pour an equal amount into each mould.\n9. Place the moulds onto a baking tray then bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes. A skewer inserted into the centre should come out clean.\n10. Once cooked, leave to cool for 5 minutes then use a sharp, serrated knife to trim each sponge level to the top of the mould.\n11.

        "recipe_comment":"These Mexican hot chocolate cookies are my cookie version of the delicious spiced hot chocolate found in Mexico. \n\nThese cookies are quite cake-y, I'd say less dense than a brownie but not as airy or moist as a cake. I'd say it's most similar in texture to European style crackle cookies.\n\n##**Guide with photos:**\n###[Mexican Hot Chocolate Cookies](https:\/\/cookingtoentertain.com\/mexican-hot-chocolate-cookies-recipe\/)\n\n##**INGREDIENTS**\n  \n\u2022 300 grams Flour AP\n\n\u2022 120 grams Dutch Process Cocoa Powder\n\n\u2022 10 grams Cinnamon, ground. Plus more for rolling.\n\n\u2022 10 grams Baking Powder\n\n\u2022 5 grams Baking Soda\n\n\u2022 1 tbsp Chili Powder, more or less to taste. With 1 tbsp you can taste the chili, but it isn\u2019t actually spicy (to me). Make of that what you will.\n\n\u2022 10 grams Vanilla Sugar I used Bourbon Vanilla Powdered Sugar but you can use 2 tsp of Vanilla Extract as a substitute.\n\n\u2022 1\/2 tsp Salt\n\n\u2022 200 grams Butter\n\n\u2022 250 grams Sugar white granulated\n\n\u2022 2 large Eggs\n\n\u2022 2 tbsp Confectioner\u2019s Sugar aka powdered sugar, for rolling. (may need more or less depending on the size of your bowl.\n\n\n##**INSTRUCTIONS**\n \n1. Preheat your oven to 170 Celsius or 350 Fahrenheit with the convection setting.\n\n2. Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, chili powder, and vanilla sugar and then add the salt.\n\n3. In the bowl of a stand mixer add the butter and sugar and cream them together using the paddle attachment. When creamed crack in the eggs and mix to form a paste.\n\n4. On the slowest speed add the dry ingredients to the wet a tablespoon at a time until everything is incorporated.\n\n5. In a bowl whisk together a few tbsp of the confectioners sugar with some ground cinnamon.\n\n6. Use a tablespoon to scoop out a chunk of the cookie dough and roll it into a ball between your palms. I created about a 2 tbsp worth ball (about the size of an egg). Place them on a parchment or silicone lined baking tray.\n\n6. Flatten the balls a bit with the palm of your hand and place the tray in the oven to bake for 12 minutes. Remove and let rest on the tray for 5 minutes before moving to a wire cooling rack.",

Browning the Meat:** In a large skillet over high heat, add 2 tbsp of the olive oil. Once hot, add the chicken, lamb pieces, and chorizo slices. Brown them on all sides (you might need to do this in few batches). Transfer the browned meat to the slow cooker.\n\n**2. Saut\u00e9ing the Vegetables:** In the same skillet, add the remaining olive oil. Saut\u00e9 the onions until translucent. Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for another minute. Transfer the onion and garlic mixture to the slow cooker.\n\n**3. Slow Cooker Layering:** On top of the meat and onions in the slow cooker, add the sliced red and green bell peppers, chopped tomatoes, and bay leaves. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika.\n\n**4. Deglazing the Skillet:** Pour the white wine into the skillet and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour this mixture into the slow cooker.\n\n**5. Cooking:** Add stock, the vegetables will release moisture as they cook. Cover and cook on the low setting for 6-8 hours or high setting for 3-4 hours (or until the meats are tender and flavours melded).\n\n**6. Final Adjustments:** Once done, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. If you desire a thicker sauce, you can thicken it with cornflour mixed with water.\n\n**7. Serving:** Serve the Chilindr\u00f3n with rice, potatoes, or crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce. Garnish with pickled chilli's for extra kick, enjoy your slow-cooked Chilindr\u00f3n!\n\nOriginally posted: [Authentic Spanish Chilindr\u00f3n Recipe](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/authentic-slow-cooker-chilindr%C3%B3n-spanish-lamb-chicken-and-chorizo-stew-recipe)",

To prepare bubble and squeak, start by chopping cooked cabbage or Brussels sprouts, carrots, and any optional meat into small pieces, ensuring the meat is heated through if using leftovers.  \n2. Season the mashed potatoes with salt and pepper if needed. Saut\u00e9 finely chopped onion in a large skillet with butter or oil until soft and translucent. Add the chopped vegetables and meat to the skillet, cooking for about 5-6 minutes to meld flavours.  \n3. Gently fold in the cold mashed potatoes, being careful not to over-mash. Flatten the mixture in the skillet with a spatula and cook over medium heat for 10-15 minutes, allowing the bottom to crisp and turn golden brown. Carefully flip the bubble and squeak using a plate or spatula, adding more butter or oil and crisping the other side for an additional 10-15 minutes. Optionally, melt grated cheese on top during the last few minutes of cooking.  \n4. Once both sides are golden and crispy, remove from heat, cut into wedges, and serve hot. Enhance with a drizzle of Worcestershire sauce or hot sauce, if desired.

If you have fresh kimchi, feel free to chop it up and throw it in instead of dehydrated.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 pound firm tofu\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced\n* 1 shallot, peeled and diced\n* \u00bc cup gochujang\n* 1 tablespoon vegan kimchi paste, optional\n* 6 cups water or vegetable broth\n* 1 tablespoon dehydrated kimchi or \u00bc cup fresh kimchi, chopped\n* 3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce more or less to taste\n* 3 teaspoons sesame oil, divided\n* 8.4 ounces ramen noodles or use 4 blocks of instant ramen noodles\n* 14.5- ounce can full-fat coconut milk\n* 5 scallions, thinly sliced; white and green parts kept separate\n* 1 cup frozen edamame\n* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds\n* Salt to taste\n\n**Press the tofu:**\n\n1. Drain the tofu and wrap it with paper towels. Place on a plate with a heavy-bottomed pan on top. Set aside for 15\u201320 minutes. Cut into bite-sized cubes.\n\n**Cook the mushrooms and shallot:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot. Add the mushrooms and cook, turning occasionally, for 8\u201310 minutes. Add the shallot and cook for 2\u20133 minutes until soft. Add a pinch of salt.\n\n**Fry the gochujang and kimchi paste:**\n\n1. Add the gochujang and kimchi paste to the pot. Cook for 1\u20132 minutes until it begins to deepen in color.\n\n**Simmer the broth:**\n\n1. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil. Add the kimchi, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce if needed. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings.\n\n**Cook the noodles and tofu:**\n\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the ramen noodles according to package instructions. Drain into a colander and rinse. Divide the cooked noodles between four bowls.\n2. Add the cubed tofu to the ramen broth and continue simmering as the noodles finish cooking.\n\n**Finish the broth:**\n\n1. Add the coconut milk and scallion whites to the broth and simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings.\n2. Add the frozen edamame to the pot and simmer for 3\u20134 minutes more until bright green and warmed through. Taste and season. Turn off the heat.\n\n**Prepare the garnish:**\n\n1. In a small bowl, combine the scallion greens, remaining 2 teaspoons of sesame oil, sesame seeds, and a pinch of salt. Toss to coat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the broth over the noodles. Serve with the scallion garnish on top. Enjoy!",

Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Add a liberal pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are fork-tender. Scoop out \u00bd cup of the cooking water and set it aside. Drain the potatoes.\n2. Combine the ricotta, Parmesan cheese, chives, garlic powder, white pepper, and 2 tablespoons butter in a large bowl. Add \u00bc cup of the potato cooking water and whisk until combined. The butter does not need to be completely melted. \n3. Add the cooked potatoes and use a masher to mash until mostly smooth. Taste and add salt and pepper. Add more of the potato cooking water or a splash of heavy cream as needed and continue mashing until the potatoes reach your desired consistency. Cover the bowl with foil and keep the potatoes warm.\n\n**Cook the pancetta:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400\u00baF.\n2. Add the pancetta to a large, cold oven-proof wide pot and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook for 6\u20138 minutes, stirring frequently, until the pancetta is very crispy. Remove the pancetta from the pot using a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan.\n\n**Caramelize the shallots:**\n\n1. In the same pot over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once hot and shimmering, add the shallots, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes until the shallots begin to brown. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of sugar on top and continue cooking over low to medium-low heat (adjust the heat periodically as they cook) for 10 minutes more until evenly browned. Shallots burn very easily, so keep an eye on them!\n2. Remove the shallots from the pot and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate. Season to taste with a sprinkle of salt. Carefully wipe out the skillet.\n\n**Cook the pork tenderloin:**\n\n1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the pot over medium-high. Once hot, add the pork tenderloin and cook for 3\u20134 minutes per side until the entire tenderloin is well-seared.\n2. Transfer the pot to the oven and cook for an additional 15\u201318 minutes or until the pork reaches 135\u00baF at the thickest part. Remove the pot from the oven, transfer the tenderloin to a cutting board, and rest for 10 minutes. After the pork has rested, thinly slice and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.\n\n**Make the spinach:**\n\n1. Return the pot used for the pork tenderloin to the stove over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Once melted and bubbly, add the minced garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n2. Pour in the chicken broth and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.\n3. Add the spinach and cook for 2\u20134 minutes, stirring regularly, until the spinach wilts. Add the lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and black pepper. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving platter and top with the spinach and a few spoonfuls of the pan sauce. Arrange the sliced pork tenderloin on top. Garnish with the crispy pancetta, browned shallots, and minced parsley. Spoon the remaining pan sauce on top of the pork. Enjoy!",

During this cook time, immersion blend or stir together the Maple Syrup, Brown Mustard, and Apple Cider Vinegar. \n7. At this point the apples should still have some firmness, and the squash should be very tender. Take the Maple Syrup and Mustard mixture and drizzle it over the apples and squash. Place back in the oven and cook for 5 more minutes.\n8. Remove from oven and plate! I garnished mine with some fresh Nasturtiums from the garden, but any fresh addition on top would be nice.

It\u2019s often garnished with fresh cucumber slices and drizzled with a savory, sweet sauce before serving.

(Keep the marinade sauce \u2013 don\u2019t discard it!!)\n\n**4.** There are two cooking methods for the pork:\n\n1. Use an air fryer; place the meat in a single layer and cook at 320\u00b0F \/ 160\u00b0C, then flip andcook the other side for 5 more minutes. This is the method I like best.\n2. Grill over charcoal until the pork is fully cooked, flip occasionally to prevent burning.Alternatively, you can use a grilling pan.\n\n**5.** After cooking it, we\u2019ll let the meat rest for a few minutes before slicing, this will increase its tenderness and allows the juices to spread evenly. Meanwhile, we can make the sauce.\n\nAdd palm sugar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, dark soy sauce, and light soy sauce into the leftover marinade sauce and mix thoroughly.\n\n**6.** Move the sauce to a pot or wok over medium heat. Once it starts bubbling, pour in water. If the sauce isn\u2019t your desired thickness, consider mixing the optional tapioca starch with 5 fl oz of water. Add gradually and stir until it\u2019s just right.\n\n**7.** Slice the pork against the grain into long strips. Serve immediately. Scoop a portion of rice onto a plate, top with red pork slices, and drizzle with red sauce.\n\nPS, don't forget to make a batch of jasmine rice.",

Then use a sharp knife to make a cross hatch pattern on one of the surfaces, going down no more than a centimeter.\n\n3. Set a pan on medium-high heat and add your butter or oil. Place your mushrooms down and let them brown before flipping. Cook on both sides until nicely browned. Make sure they end up with the cross hatch pattern facing up.\n\n4. Add the garlic to the pan and quickly fry it for no more than 15 seconds. Then pour in the chicken stock mix. Let the sauce heat up and thicken.

Sterilize a glass bottle in boiling water (pay attention to the capacity), let it dry well. We will use it to bottle the basil oil\n2. Whash the basil\n3. In a saucepan, boil the water and add the salt. Cook the basil for about 2 minutes\n4. Put the basil in a bowl of cold water and ice for 1-2 minutes, then dry it well with paper towels\n5. Blend the basil with oil, garlic and a little salt (3-4 minutes at maximum speed)\n6. Filter with a colander (the narrower the screen, the clearer and more intense the color of the oil will be)\n7. Store for 4-5 weeks max in a cool place away from light\n\nPAY attention: I keep My basil oil 3 months and more, the last month I keep it in the refrigerator, but being homemade it is better to use a lot of precaution to prevent botox and bacteria, so point 7 I suggested you to keep it only for few weeks.",

Pour in the milk, stirring constantly as you pour, until the flour is incorporated and the sauce is smooth. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally as it cooks to prevent sticking. Add more milk as needed if the liquid evaporates too quickly.\n5. After 15 minutes, stir in the cream. Taste and season. If you like, use an immersion blender and blend half the mixture. Simmer for 5 minutes more. The sauce should be thick, and the corn should be creamy and tender.\n\n**Cook the shrimp:**\n\n1. In a large skillet, heat the neutral oil over medium-high until hot.

Melt the butter into the tomatoes and season them with salt and pepper.\n3. Add the shrimp to the tomatoes and immediately spread them into an even layer.\n4. Cook for 2\u20133 minutes per side until almost opaque. The cooking time will depend on the size of the shrimp. Turn off the heat and stir in the parsley and lemon juice. Let stand in the hot skillet for a minute or two to allow the residual heat to finish cooking the shrimp.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the corn into shallow bowls and pile the shrimp on top. Spoon any sauce from the skillet over the shrimp. Garnish with more parsley and a pinch of Aleppo pepper flakes. Enjoy!",

The super concentrated paste in those metal tubes will be far too much.\n\n\u2022 1 cup Vodka\n\n\u2022 360 ml Heavy Cream as you can see I used 33% heavy cream. I would not recommend going below that.\n\n\u2022 50 grams Butter about 3 tbsp or in America a little less than half a stick.\n\n\u2022 Salt for the pasta water\n\n\u2022 1 tsp Black Pepper freshly cracked. If using powdered black pepper then a half teaspoon will be fine.\n\n\u2022 Parmigiano Reggiano to taste\n\n\u2022 Basil for garnish\n\n\n## **INSTRUCTIONS**\n \n1. Start boiling a pot of heavily salted water. Heat up some oil in a pan on medium heat. Add the onion and stir until somewhat translucent. Add in the Calabrian chili and garlic and continue stirring for another minute or so.\n2. Add the tomato paste and stir it around to mix with the other stuff in the pan, then pour in the vodka. Stir the vodka around and let everything reduce a bit, about 3-5 minutes. Here you can add the pasta to the boiling salted water and cook until al dente.\n3. Next add in the butter and chili flakes and stir until the butter is fully melted, then pour in the cream. Stir the pan around until well combined, then lower the heat to low.\nWhen the pasta is ready, about 2 minutes less than what the box will usually say, remove a cup of water from the pot. Set aside. Drain the pasta and add the rigatoni right to the sauce. 4. Give everything a mix and re-add the reserved water to the pan about a quarter cup at a time until you reach desired consistency. You don't need to use all of the water.\n5. Plate the pasta, grate over some good quality Parmigiano Reggiano, and sprinkle over some basil chiffonade. Enjoy!",

In a saucepan on medium high heat add the sugar and allow to caramelize. You don't need to touch it. Once it is just caramelized add in all the walnuts and stir\/toss the pan around so all the walnuts are coated. Pour the contents in one layer onto a sheet of parchment paper and let cool.\n\n2. In a bowl add the chicken pieces along with the soy sauces, rice wine, and potato starch. Mix everything up and let sit while you cook the mushrooms.\n\n3. Back in the pan add the oil and put the heat on medium high. When hot add in the quartered mushrooms and let cook. It's hard to overcook mushrooms so you don't need to worry with the pan too much. I let them brown on the edges and toss the pan every minute or so. After the mushrooms are sufficiently browned add the bowl of chicken and the marinade.\n\n4. As soon as you add the chicken and marinade to the pan start stirring\/tossing the pan. The chicken will only take 2-3 minutes to cook. While the chicken is cooking you can break up the walnuts.\n\n5. Take the parchment paper with the walnuts on it and roll it up into a ball. Smack the ball on the countertop a few times to break up the walnuts fused together with the sugar. Add the walnuts to the pan.\n\n6. Toss the pan around now with the walnuts, just to soften the hard or sharp sugar. I cook this for about a minute and then add the peas. Toss with the peas quickly, add the hoisin and sesame oil and turn off the heat. Give the pan one more good stir and then plate the dish.",

Cook the eggplants in the air fryer for 15 minutes, flipping them occasionally. If using the oven, roast them on the highest rack for about 20 minutes.\n3. While the eggplants are cooking, mix all the kebab ingredients (except parsley) in a bowl. Knead the mixture for 5-6 minutes. Add the chopped parsley and knead for an additional 2 minutes.\n4. Place cling film on your counter. Take 1\/5 (140-150g) of the kebab mixture and shape it into a patty. Spread the mixture on the cling film to coat one eggplant. Place the eggplant on the patty and roll it tightly with the cling film, resembling a wrap. Ensure there are no holes or cracks in the patty; if there are any, patch them up by wetting your hand.\n5. Grease a tray with olive oil or use cooking spray. Arrange the pear-shaped kebabs on the tray, with the head and feet in place. Cook in the air fryer at 200\u00b0C (392\u00b0F) for about 8-9 minutes. If using the oven, cook at 220\u00b0C (428\u00b0F).\n6. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped garlic and cook for 15-20 seconds. Before the garlic changes color, add the grated tomatoes.\n7. Season the sauce with salt, black pepper, sugar, vinegar, and oregano. Stir well and simmer for 10-12 minutes.\n8. Once the kebabs are cooked, let them rest for 5 minutes. Pour the tomato sauce onto the bottom of a plate. Place the pear kebabs on top of the sauce and sprinkle some parsley.

Place your pan on medium-high heat and add a good amount of oil. Add in your sliced mushrooms and let fry until slightly browned. Add in the diced onion and stir until the onion is translucent or browned.    \n\n\n4.

You can add more brown gravy on top of the egg if you like, otherwise you can sprinkle with chopped scallions and chili peppers, or whatever other garnishes you prefer.\n\n * * *",

Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps to remove any excess starch.\n\n\n2. In a pot, add the rinsed rice, vegetable oil, and salt and + 1\/2 water of the quantity of rice measured with cups. \n\n\n3. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.\n\n\n4. Once the water starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer the rice for about 15 minutes, or until it is fully cooked.\n\n\n5. Once the rice is cooked, let it cool down to room temperature. This will help to ensure that the grains separate easily later on.\n\n\n**Step 2: Marinating the Chicken**\n\n1. Cut the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces and place them in a bowl.\n\n\n2. Add salt, black pepper, extra virgin olive oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, and oregano to the bowl.\n\n\n3. Mix well until the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade.\n\n\n4. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes, or for even better flavor, refrigerate it for a few hours.\n\n**Step 3: Preparing the Vegetables**\n\n1. Peel and dice the carrots into small cubes.\n\n\n2. Remove the seeds from the green bell pepper and chop it into small pieces.\n\n\n3. Thinly slice the red onion.\n\n\n4. Finely chop the chives.\n\n\n**Step 4: Cooking the Chicken**\n\n1. Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add oil.\n\n\n2. Add the marinated chicken to the pan and fry until it is cooked through and golden brown. Set aside.\n\n\n**Step 5: Scrambling the Eggs**\n\n1. In a separate pan, heat some oil over medium heat.\n\n\n2. Crack the eggs into the pan and scramble them until they are fully cooked. Set aside.\n\n**Step 6: Stir-Frying the Vegetables and Rice**\n\n1. In the same pan, add some oil, minced garlic, ginger, and 1 maggi cube. Stir for a short while.\n\n\n2. Add the diced carrots to the pan and fry for about 1 minute.\n\n\n3. Add the green bell pepper, red onion, and any other desired vegetables. Fry for about 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally.\n\n\n4. Remove the vegetables from the pan and set them aside.\n\n\n5. In the same pan, add the rest of the ginger, garlic, and 2 maggi cubes. Again, stir fry for a short while and add your cooked rice. Mix well. \n\n6. Add the sesame oil and soy sauce. Give it a good mix.\n\n7. Add the cooked chicken, scrambled eggs and the cooked vegetables. Mix it all together and add the chives. \n\n8. Serve immediately!",

Once the gelatin has bloomed, add it to the pot with the heavy cream and sugar.\n\n\n4. Place the pot on low heat and stir for about 5 minutes to allow the gelatin and sugar to dissolve completely.\n\n\n5. Remove the pot from the heat and let the mixture cool down slightly.\n\n\n6. Pour the creamy mixture into transparent glasses, filling them about halfway.\n\n\n7. Cover the glasses with plastic wrap or lids to prevent the surface of the panna cotta from drying.\n\n\n8. Place the glasses in the refrigerator and let them chill for 2-4 hours, or until the first layer solidifies.\n\n**Step 2: Preparing the Second Layer** \n\n9. In a small bowl, combine 1 teaspoon of gelatin with 1 tablespoon of hot water and let it bloom.\n\n\n10. Cut off the tips of the fresh strawberries and transfer them to a cooking pot.\n\n\n11. Add the sugar and 2 tablespoons of water to the pot with the strawberries.\n\n\n12. Place the pot over medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle boil, stirring occasionally for 7 minutes. This will help release the juices from the strawberries and dissolve the sugar.\n\n\n13. Add the bloomed gelatin to the pot and continue to boil for another minute, stirring constantly.\n\n\n14. Remove the pot from the heat and let the strawberry mixture cool for a few minutes.\n\n\n15. Transfer the strawberry mixture to a blender and blend until smooth.\n\n\n16. To remove the seeds and any pulp, strain the strawberry puree using a fine-mesh sieve.\n\n\n17. Allow the strawberry puree to cool down for a while.\n\n\n18. Take out the chilled glasses from the refrigerator and carefully pour the strawberry puree on top of the first layer, filling the glasses to the brim.\n\n\n19. Once again, cover the glasses to prevent the surface from drying out.\n\n\n20. Return the glasses to the refrigerator and let them solidify for at least 2 hours or until the second layer sets completely.\n\nEnjoy your strawberry panna cotta!\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n**NOTE:**\n\nRecipe for 4 servings",

        "recipe_comment":"#PROSCIUTTO BREAD\n*Yield: 2 loaves*\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 16 \u00bd oz bread flour\n* 1 \u00bd tsp instant or rapid-rise yeast\n* 1 tsp table salt\n* 1 cup mild lager, room temp (such as Budweiser)\n* 6 tbsp water, room temperature\n* 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil\n* 5 oz mild provolone cheese, cut into thick \u00bd\u201d pieces\n* 9 oz assorted cured Italian meats (prosciutto, capicola, pepperoni, mortadella, etc), cut into rough \u00bc\u201d to \u00bd\u201d pieces\n* \u00bd tbsp coarsely ground black pepper\n* Cornmeal\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1. *Make the dough:* Whisk flour, yeast, and salt together in bowl of stand mixer. Whisk beer, room-temperature water, and oil together in 2-cup liquid measuring cup.\n\n2. *Knead the dough:* Fit mixer with dough hook. Mix flour mixture on low speed while slowly adding beer mixture until cohesive dough starts to form and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl, about 8 minutes.\n\n3. *Add meat and cheese:* Reduce speed to low and add provolone, prosciutto, pepperoni, capicola, and pepper. Continue to knead until combined, about 2 minutes longer (some meats and cheese may not be fully incorporated into dough at this point; this is OK). Transfer dough and any errant pieces of meats and cheese to lightly floured counter and knead by hand to evenly incorporate meats and cheese into dough, about 1 minute.\n4. *Let dough rise:* Form dough into smooth, round ball and place seam side down in lightly greased large bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let dough rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1\u00bd hours.\n5. *Separate into two pieces:* Line baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust with cornmeal. Turn out dough onto counter and gently press down to deflate any large air pockets. Cut dough into 2 even pieces. Press each piece of dough into 8 by 5-inch rectangle with long side parallel to counter's edge.\n6. *Shape and second rise:* Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, fold top edge of rectangle down to midline, pressing to seal. Fold bottom edge of rectangle up to midline and pinch to seal. Flip dough seam side down and gently roll into 12-inch loaf with tapered ends. Transfer loaf to 1 side of prepared sheet. Repeat shaping with second piece of dough and place loaf about 3 inches from first loaf on sheet. Cover with greased plastic and let rise at room temperature until puffy and dough springs back slowly when pressed lightly with your finger, about 45 minutes.\n7. *Bake:* Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Using sharp paring knife in swift, fluid motion, make \u00bd-inch-deep lengthwise slash along top of each loaf, starting and stopping about 1\u00bd inches from ends. Bake until loaves register 205 to 210 degrees, 22 to 25 minutes. Transfer loaves to wire rack and let cool completely before serving, about 3 hours. To store, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate, allowing to reach room temperature before serving again. This bread freezes excellently and can be thawed in the oven without issue.",

        "recipe_comment":"Braising in an Instant Pot has probably been one of my favorite methods of cooking - just getting that perfect texture of meat.\n\nFull recipe: [https:\/\/www.theflouredcamera.com\/instant-pot-chinese-braised-beef-and-daikon\/](https:\/\/www.theflouredcamera.com\/instant-pot-chinese-braised-beef-and-daikon\/)\n\n# Equipment\n\n* 1 6 qt Instant Pot\n\n# Ingredients\n\n* 3 lbs beef rough flank\n* 2 lbs Chinese daikon\n* 6 cloves garlic (smashed)\n* 2 stalks scallion (cut into 3 inch pieces)\n* 3 small shallots (quartered)\n* 1 inch ginger (sliced into thin pieces)\n* \u00bd cup Shaoxing wine\n* 3 tablespoon light soy sauce\n* 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce\n* 1 tablespoon oyster sauce\n* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar\n* 5 bay leaves\n* 4 star anise\n* 1 dried orange peel\n* 1 cup low sodium chicken stock\n* 3 tablespoon cornstarch (mixed with 4 tablespoon of water)\n* Salt (to taste)\n\n# Instructions\n\n1. Pat the beef dry. Set the Instant Pot to 'Saut\u00e9' and wait for the pot screen to read 'Hot'. This can take a couple minutes. Add a neutral oil and then the meat. Sear both sides - this will take a couple batches. Even with the oil, you may find that the meat may stick a bit to the pot. Let it sear undisturbed and it will release much more easily.\n2. Remove the meat and add the aromatics to the pot with some oil. Stir-fry until fragrant which should take about 2 minutes.\n3. Add the meat back into the pot with light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine sugar, and oyster sauce. Stir to evenly distribute the sauce. Then add bay leaves, star anise, and dried orange peel.\n4. Add daikon to the IP. Use a spatula to move the daikon towards the bottom of the pot so there's a better chance for the daikon to soak up the sauce. Finally, add the chicken stock.\n5. Secure the lid on the IP. Set IP to Pressure Cook for 10 minutes. Let pot Natural Release.\n6. Once you can remove the lid safely, set the pot back into Saut\u00e9 mode. Add cornstarch mixture (pre-mix this in a separate bowl before adding into the IP) and allow the ingredients to simmer until the sauce thickens. Let simmer for another 5 minutes to slightly reduce the sauce.\n7. Taste and add salt to your preference.\n8. Serve over rice!",

Separating the cabbage leaves slowly and carefully, ensuring not to rip them, take batches at a time and add them into a pot of boiling water.\n2. Simmer the blend for about 5 minutes until the ingredients become soft, and then set aside.\n3. When the leaves have cooled, cut off the thick stems and distribute them at the bottom of the pot. Subsequently, tear each large leaf into halves \u2013 making sure that each piece does not exceed your hand size.\n4. Combine ground meat, rice, seven spice, black pepper, cinnamon, tomato concentrate, salt, and \u00bc cup regular olive oil in a mixing bowl. Mix well and place on the table.\n5. On a large plate, spread out a cabbage leaf as flat as possible.\n6. Start with the stuffing, around two tablespoons should do. Shape it into a cigar shape at the bottom of the cabbage leaf. Finally, just roll it up and your stuffed cabbage is ready to go!\n7. Spread the slices of roughly chopped garlic throughout the cabbage rolls as you peel an entire bulb.\n8. Mix together 2 cups of water, 2 tsp of salt, and the juice from a whole lemon to create a brine.\n9. Once the rolling of the cabbage leaves is complete, put a heatproof plate on top and add the brine water to it.\n10. Bring the brine water to a boil on high heat for 20 minutes. Determine if the lemon and salt levels need adjustment by tasting the liquid.\n11. Once the plate has been removed, reduce the heat to medium-low and add a drizzle of olive oil and pomegranate molasses. Lastly, a pinch of dried mint should be added. This will round off the ingredients, creating a complex and interesting flavor.\n12. Cover the skillet, and simmer for another hour until the cabbage leaves are tender. Be sure to try your Middle Eastern stuffed cabbage leaf before turning off the heat.",

Tuck the lilac blooms into a jar or container. (Snip the lilacs into shorter pieces if you need to.) Pour the cream into the jar over the lilacs. \n\n\n2. Use a spoon to push the lilacs down to completely submerge them. Cover the jar and refrigerate the cream for 24 hours.\n\n\n3. Pop the bowl and whisk attachment (or a mixing bowl and beaters from a hand mixer) into the freezer - do this at least 15 minutes before making the whipped cream.\n\n\n4. Place a small strainer over a bowl, and pour the cream through the strainer to remove the lilacs. Press down on the lilacs with your hand to squeeze out excess cream that's hiding out in the flowers. Discard the lilacs.\n\n\n\n5. Assemble the bowl and whisk onto your stand mixer. Pour the infused cream into the bowl and beat it on high speed for about 1 minute. \n\n\n6. Pause the mixer, pour in the confectioner's sugar, and resume beating the cream on high speed. It should take between 2 and 5 more minutes for the cream to firm up and form peaks.\n\n\n\n7. Serve the whipped cream with your dessert or drink right away, and add a few lilac flowers as a garnish if you wish.\n\n\n\n8. Store leftover whipped cream in a covered container for up to three days. Makes about two cups of whipped cream.\n\n\n\nNOTES\n1.  Choose vibrant lilac blooms that have just opened and that aren't yet turning brown. A few unopened buds are okay. You will get the best flavor from sprigs that have just bloomed.\n\n\n2. Lilac blooms grow in cone-shaped clusters. You want three of these clusters for this recipe.\n\n\n\n3. Give your lilac blooms a gentle wash under cool, running water to rinse off any critters or dust. Gently shake out as much of the waters as you can, and pick off any dead leaves or shriveled petals.\n\n\nRead The Full Post: https:\/\/hungryenoughtoeatsix.com\/lilac-infused-whipped-cream\/",

Place a foil catchment underneath to catch any drippings. If you have one, insert temperature probe into the roast,\n\n3.

Cook under pressure for 15 minutes.  Let the pressure release naturally, and use a wooden spoon to break up the meat. Stir the meat to combine with the liquid over saut\u00e9 for 30 minutes, until the meat reaches the desired texture. Remove from heat.",

Cook the pasta according to the package directions. Rinse the pasta under cold water until it is completely cool. Pour the pasta into a large bowl and hold it aside. \n\n\n\n2. Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally. Season both sides with 1\u00bd teaspoons of salt and \u00bd teaspoon of black pepper.\n\n\n\n3. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot place the chicken pieces in the pan. Cook the chicken for about 3-4 minutes until there is some browning on that first side. Flip the chicken pieces over and reduce the heat to very low.\n\n\n\n4. Add in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice over the chicken and cover the pan. Let the chicken sit in the pan over low heat for 20 minutes. The pieces should be cooked through by this time. Remove the pan from the heat and let the chicken cool.\n\n\n\n5. When cool enough to handle, slice the chicken into cubes and add them to the bowl with the pasta. \n\n\n\n\n6. While the chicken cooks, prepare the veggies: Slice the tops and bottoms off the bell peppers and discard the tops and the seeds and membranes from inside. Slice the peppers into small pieces. Add these to the bowl with the pasta. \n\n\n\n7. Wash the asparagus and snap off the ends. If the stalks are very thick, use a vegetable peeler to peel the bottoms of the stalks.\n\n\n\n8. In a medium skillet add enough water for a depth of \u00bc-inch. Heat the water to a simmer and add in the asparagus. Cover the pan and steam the asparagus for 3-5 minutes until it is just tender.\n\n\n\n9. Remove the asparagus from the water and run the stalks under cold water until they are cool. Slice the asparagus into small pieces and add them to the bowl. \n\n\n\n10. Rinse and dry the basil leaves, then tear them into small pieces and add them to the bowl.\n\n\n\n\n11. Place the following into a jar that has a tight-fitting lid: the \u00bd cup of olive oil, the \u00bd cup of lemon juice, the sour cream, vinegar, mustard, the \u00be teaspoon salt and \u00bd teaspoon pepper. Close the jar and shake the dressing vigorously to blend it.  \n\n\n\n\n12. Pour the dressing over everything in the bowl and stir the salad together with a large spoon. All ingredients should be well mixed and coated with the dressing. \n\n  \n\n13. Spoon the salad into serving bowls and top each bowl with some of the crumbled goat cheese. Serve the salad immediately. Makes about 8 cups.\n\n\n\nGet The Recipe: https:\/\/hungryenoughtoeatsix.com\/lemon-chicken-pasta-salad-with-basil-asparagus-goat-cheese\/",

        "recipe_comment":"Hello friends!\n\nToday, I\u2019m sharing my recipe for chicken meatballs with cream sauce. It\u2019s a delicious dish that can be prepared in a short amount of time. [Original recipe](https:\/\/grillmangal.art\/en\/chicken-meatballs-in-creamy-sauce\/)\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 700 g ground chicken\n* 50 g white bread (crumb)\n* 50 ml milk\n* 120 g onion (1 medium onion)\n* 1 tsp salt (6 g)\n* 1\/2 tsp black pepper (1.5 g)\n* 1\/2 tsp oregano\n* 50 g butter\n* 100 ml 20% cream\n* 100 ml chicken broth\n* 3-4 tbsp sunflower oil (for frying)\n\n**Cooking process**\n\n1. Finely chop the onion.\n2. Heat a frying pan, add 1 tbsp sunflower oil and put the finely chopped onion here.\n3. Fry until soft, stirring so it doesn\u2019t burn. Over medium heat.\n4. Crumble the white bread and pour in 50 ml of milk, let it stand for 5-7 minutes to soak well.\n5. Put the ground meat in a bowl where we will knead it, make a recess and put the onion there, add the bread with the milk. Instead of ground meat, you can take chicken breast and finely chop it. As I usually do.\n6. Add salt, pepper. You can also add various spices, such as turmeric, oregano, etc. I don\u2019t add them to this recipe.\n7. Mix the meat mixture thoroughly.\n8. The amount of meat and other ingredients is not just for nothing) I make meatballs of approximately 80 grams each, 12 pieces in total, and that\u2019s exactly how many fit in a 32 cm diameter frying pan.\n9. Divide the meat mixture into equal pieces, make balls out of them. Do not roll them too hard, so they don\u2019t become too dense inside.\n10. Heat the same frying pan where you fried the onion. Add all the sunflower oil, 2-3 tbsp.\n11. Add 50 g of butter to the same frying pan.\n12. As soon as the butter melts and starts sizzling, place our meatballs in the frying pan.\n13. Put them on the edges of the pan, the center will come in handy.\n14. Fry until golden brown (usually 2-3 minutes) on one side, turn over to the other. All this is done over high heat.\n15. Fry for a couple of minutes, make sure that a crust has formed on the other side as well, reduce the heat to medium.\n16. In the center of the pan, sprinkle 1\/2 teaspoon of oregano, mix, let the aroma develop.\n17. Pour 100 ml of broth into a pan, you can use ready-made broths, but you need to carefully look at their composition (how much salt, spices, etc.).\n18. Add cream.\n19. Stir the resulting sauce in the middle of the pan.\n20. Cook for another 7-8 minutes and turn off.\n21. The dish is ready.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the whole recipe!\n\nCook with pleasure!",

Sear beef in 2 batches so you don't overcrowd the pan.\nRemove beef to a plate and cover to keep warm.\n\n2. Add 2 Tbsp butter, chopped onion and sliced mushrooms. Sautee 6-8 minutes or until liquid has evaporated and onions and mushrooms are soft and lightly browned.\n\n3. Add 1 minced garlic clove and sautee 1 minute until fragrant. Add 1 Tbsp flour and sautee another minute stirring constantly.\n\n4. Pour in 1 cups beef broth, scraping any bits from the bottom of the pan then add 3\/4 cup whipping cream and simmer another 1 to 2 minutes or until slightly thickened.\n\n5. Stir a few Tablespoons of the sauce into 1\/4 cup of sour cream to temper it so the sour cream doesn't curdle then add it to the pan while stirring constantly.\n\n6.

Add beef with any accumulated juices back to the pan and bring just to a simmer or until beef is heated through.\n\nPersonal notes: While searing the sirloin strips, I lightly season it with salt and pepper, which adds more flavor to the beef. Rather than using 1\/2 tsp salt in the sauce, I add just a couple dashes salt and pepper",

Spray a 9\" springform pan with cooking spray then line the bottom with parchment paper. Add a layer of Oatmeal Creme Pies to the bottom to act as the crust of the cheesecake (it took 6 big ones for me). \n2. Add the softened cream cheese, brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, molasses and pumpkin pie spice to the bowl of a stand mixer and mix for about 1 minute until well mixed. \n3. In another large bowl beat the cream until soft peaks form, then add the powdered sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks have formed. \n4. Fold the cream into the cream cheese mixture. \n5. Pour this cream cheese mixture over the top of the oatmeal cookie crust. \n6. Spread out evenly then refrigerate for about 6 hours (I let mine refrigerate over night- which is best if you have time). \n7. After the oatmeal creme pie cheesecake has set, take about 2 more creme pies and chop into pieces then decorate the top of the cheesecake. \n8. When serving, drizzle with the caramel sauce (caramel syrup).",

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon for 15\u201320 minutes until browned and cooked through. Season with salt and pepper.\n2. Transfer the cooked beef to a paper towel-lined plate and discard all but 2 teaspoons of fat in the skillet.\n\n**Cook the onion and peppers:**\n\n1. Return the skillet to the stove over medium heat. Add the onion and both diced peppers and cook until softened, about 5\u20137 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper.\n2. Add the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne powder, paprika, and turmeric. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and mash it into the skillet.

Serve the hot dog sauce on top of your favorite hot dog. Be sure to warm the buns first! I like to microwave them so they\u2019re soft, but toast or grill them if you prefer. Serve with ketchup, mustard, and finely minced yellow onion on top. Enjoy!",

In a stand mixer bowl, or in a bowl with a handheld mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.\n4. Add the egg and vanilla and mix until incorporated. \n5. Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and mix on low, until incorporated.\n6. Roll out the dough to 10mm\/ 3\/8\u201d thickness and chill covered in the freezer for 10 minutes.\n7. Cut the dough into 2\u201d rounds and transfer to baking sheet.\n8. Bake for 13-15 minutes until lightly golden at the edges.\n9.

Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n2. In a bowl, whisk or sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt until well combined. Set aside.\n3. In an another bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes if by stand mixer.\n4. Beat in the oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. On the lowest speed, gradually beat in the eggs until just incorporated. Mix in the flour mixture, until just combined.\n5. Coat a 12-cup bundt pan or two 6-cup bundt pans with cooking spray.\n6. Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan.\n7. Firmly tap the pan against the countertop to knock out any bubbles.\n8. Bake on the middle oven rack for 50-70 minutes for a 12-cup bundt pan (45-65 minutes for two 6-cup bundt pans), or until a toothpick comes out clean near the center. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then loosen the cake by tapping it against the counter. Invert the cake onto a serving platter.\n\nMAKE THE LEMON GLAZE:\n\n1. Stir together lemon glaze ingredients (lemon juice &amp; sugar - if needed, heat them briefly to help dissolve the sugar). Brush on the hot cake until all of the glaze is absorbed (you may not end up using all of the glaze).\n\nMAKE LEMON ICING &amp; SERVE:\n\n\n1. whisk together the icing ingredients (powdered sugar &amp; lemon juice), adjusting the lemon juice amount to make the icing fairly thick but pourable, however not too runny. If the icing is close to the thickness you want, but still a touch too thick to pour, warm it slightly and it will become more fluid when it cools off (perfect for icing the bundt cake). Drizzle the icing over the top of the bundt cake and serve when the icing sets.",

It's better if it's chilled\n\nDecoration:\n\n* 3 tbsp (45ml) lemon juice\n* 2 tbsp (30ml) water\n* 2 tbsp (25g) sugar\n* Thinly sliced lemon\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. In a food processor, add 4oz (120g) digestive biscuits. Crush them until they are totally crushed, or no big chunks left (0,2 inches-0,5 cm). Add 4 tbsp (60g) of melted butter, and process until totally combined. You can also do this whole process by having the biscuits in a zip bag, and crushing them with a rolling pin, and then combining it with the melted butter in a small bowl with a spoon.\n2. Add the mixture into a 8inch (20cm) spring pan or a removable bottom pan, and flatten it with a spoon or the bottom of a cup. Leave in the fridge for later.\n3. In a small bowl with cold water, add 5 sheets of gelatin. Leave for later.\n4. In a small sauce pan, add 3 tbsp (50ml) of water, 7tbsp (100ml) of lemon juice (2-3 lemons), and 1\/2 Cup (100g) of granulated sugar. Turn it on to low-medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves. Once it starts boiling, add the 5 sheets of gelatin, turn off the heat, and stir for 1min before taking of heat, and leaving it to cool down for 5mins.\n5. In a big bowl, add 12oz (350g) of Philadelphia cream cheese (room temperature), the zest of 2 lemons, and the lemon mixture from before, and whisk until combined.\n6. In another big bowl, add 12oz (350ml) of heavy cream (35% fat, and better if it's chilled), and beat until medium-stiff peaks.\n7. Add the Philadelphia mixture to the Heavy Cream mixture, and beat everything until combined. Then pour the mixture in the pan with the crust, flatten it out, and leave in fridge for at least 2 hours.\n8. For the decoration, into a bowl with cold water, add 1 gelatin sheet. Leave it for later.\n9. In a small sauce pan, add 3 tbsp (45ml) lemon juice, 2 tbsp (30ml) water, and 2 tbsp (25g) sugar. Turn it on to low-medium heat, and stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the gelatin sheet and stir for 1min. Then let the mixture cool down for 5min.\n10. After those 5mins, you can add 1 or 2 drops of yellow coloring.\n11. Pour the mixture into the Philadelphia pan. Pour it on top of the pan, on the back of table spoon, so it doesn't damage the surface of the cake. At this point you could also decorate with very thinly sliced lemon before putting it in the fridge for at least 2 hours.",

Line 1-2 baking sheet(s) with parchment paper. Set aside.\n\nBrown Butter\n\n1. In a small saucepan and over medium-low heat, melt butter. Swirl pan every 30 seconds until butter begins to sizzle. Reduce heat to low.\n2. Continue swirling for ~3 minutes or until melted butter becomes foamy, makes popping sounds, and begins to take on a nutty aroma! Mixture will begin to turn golden brown and have brown flakes interspersed. Remove from heat.\n3. Using a wooden spoon or spatula stir butter, lift browned butter bits from the bottom of the pan. Allow to cool slightly before using for the dough steps (below).\n\nHalva Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough\n\n1. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt (note: this process aerates and sifts dry ingredients). Set aside.\n2. In a large bowl with an electric mixer, beat sugars (brown and granulated) with brown butter until smooth. Add heavy cream and continue to beat for another minute on medium-low speed.\n3. Add egg and vanilla extract. Continue mixing on medium-low speed until combined. Scrape the sides of your mixing bowl to incorporate all ingredients.\n4. Slowly add the dry (flour mixture) to the wet (butter\/sugar\/egg mixture), beating on low speed until just combined. Add chocolate chips to the batter. Stir\/mix until just until combined.\n5. Add crumbled halva to the cookie batter. Stir together one final time until evenly incorporated.\n6. Scoop dough into 2 tbsp portions and set on flat plate\/baking sheet. Cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1h.\n\nAssembly\/Baking\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350F (325F if using convection bake).\n2. Once dough is chilled, remove cookie dough balls from the fridge and place cookies onto a baking sheet, spaced 2-3\" apart.\n3. Pro-tip:\u00a0For the perfect, textured, chocolate chip cookie shape after baking \u2013 tear each refrigerated dough ball in half, place the bottom half on the top half, and press the two halves together *slightly* into a fairly round ball. Watch the perfect cookie form while it bakes!\n4. Bake cookies at 350F for ~15 min or until the edges are golden brown and firm.\n5. Sprinkle each cookie with flaked salt upon removing from the oven and allow to cool completely on the cookie sheet.\n6. Enjoy!!",

Put it in the fridge until the first layer is ready. \n3. Place 2.5 gelatin sheets into a small bowl of cold water. \n4. Add the dark chocolate and 1\/4 cup (60g) of heavy milk into a heat-proof bowl. Place it over a saucepan with simmering water, and at low heat, stir it until the chocolate is melted. \n5. Add the gelatin sheets to the bowl with the chocolate and mix it really well.

Whip the cup (240g) of heavy milk (better if it's chilled) in a big bowl until stiff peaks, and then add the melted chocolate and mix until combined. \n7. Add the mixture to the pan with the crust, and even it out. Leave it in the fridge until the next layer. \n8. For the strawberry layer, add the strawberries to a food processor and blend until they are liquid. (Optional: After it's liquid, pass it through a sieve in case you don't want seeds.) \n9. Place three gelatin sheets into a small bowl of cold water. \n10. Add the strawberry liquid and 1\/4 cup (50g) of sugar to a medium-heat pan and stir until the sugar is mixed (a few mins).\n11. Place the resulting liquid into a bowl, add the gelatin sheets, and mix it really well. Then leave it in the fridge until it's not warm to the touch, around 30\u201360 minutes. If the gelatin has started to set, whisk well until smooth and loose again. \n12. Whip the 1 + 1\/4 cup (300g in total) of heavy milk (better if it's cold) until stiff peaks, and then add the strawberry mixture and mix until combined. \n13. Add the mixture over the first chocolate layer and leave it for at least 3 hours. \n14. To remove the cake from the pan, run a knife along the edges of the pan.\n15.  You can add optional cacao powder on top of the cake.",

Turn the oven off, and open the oven door slightly but keep the cheesecake inside for another 1 \u00bd hour so it can gradually cool.\n10. Take the cheesecake out of the oven, using a knife to run around the edges to separate the cake from the pan. Don't take the cake out of the pan though. Place the cheesecake directly into the fridge to chill 6-8 hours, preferably overnight.",

However, keep in mind that in that case, the baking time may be longer.\n\n\\* parchment paper\n\n\\* mixing bowl\n\n\\* standing mixer or hand mixer\n\n\\* spatula\n\n\\* cooling rack (optional)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to prepare Polish Summer Fruit Cake:**\n\n**1.** Preheat the fan-assisted oven to 365\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Prepare a baking tray by greasing it lightly with oil and lining it with parchment paper to keep it in place.\n\n**2.** For the cake batter, in a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until pale and fluffy. Reduce the speed to medium and gradually add the eggs one by one, ensuring they are well incorporated. Then, add the vanilla bean paste.\n\n**3.** Stop the mixer and add the sifted flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix on low speed until the ingredients are fully incorporated. If the mixture appears too thick, add two tablespoons of milk or water and incorporate it.\n\n**4.** Using a spatula, transfer the batter to the prepared baking tray and spread it evenly. Arrange the fruit on top; you can halve the strawberries, cut the rhubarb into chunks, and quarter the apricots.\n\n**5.** To prepare the crumble topping, place all the crumble ingredients in a bowl and rub the mixture between your fingers until it is almost combined. Sprinkle the crumble evenly over the fruit.\n\n**6.** Place the baking tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 40-45 minutes.\n\n**7.** Once the cake is ready, allow it to cool for 10 minutes before serving. You can transfer it to a cooling rack, using a sheet of paper and the help of another person to expedite the cooling process.\n\n**8.** Enjoy your delicious cake with a cup of coffee!

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally: [Rhubarb Tart with Homemade Ice Cream](https:\/\/newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com\/p\/rhubarb-for-the-weekend)**\n\nServes: 10 | Cook time: 2 hours (plus 4 hours inactive time)\n\n**Tart filling:**\n\n* 1\u00bd pounds rhubarb, trimmed and chopped (4 cups chopped rhubarb total)\n* \u00bd cup sugar\n* \u00bd cup water\n* 4 drops of red food coloring, optional\n* 6 egg yolks\n* \u00bd cup sugar\n* 6 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter; cut into cubes\n\n**Rhubarb ice cream:**\n\n* 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 16 ounces heavy cream\n* \u00bd cup prepared rhubarb (from above)\n\n**Tart crust:**\n\n* \u00bd cup (53 g) whole pecans\n* 1 cup flour\n* \u00bc cup (32 g) powdered sugar\n* \u00bc teaspoon salt\n* \u00bd cup (1 stick) unsalted butter\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* For serving:\n* Powdered sugar, optional\n\n**Prepare the rhubarb:**\n\n1. Combine the chopped rhubarb, \u00bd cup sugar, and \u00bd cup water in a medium pot and bring to a boil.\n2. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30\u201345 minutes until very soft.\n3. Use an immersion blender to blend until completely smooth. You may also use a traditional blender or food processor. Just pour the mixture back into the pot.\n4. Let the rhubarb cool completely. Add the food coloring, if using, and mix well to incorporate.\n5. Remove \u00bd cup of the rhubarb mixture from the pot and reserve for the homemade ice cream.\n\n**Make the ice cream:**\n\n1. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a medium mixing bowl and add the vanilla extract. Stir to combine.\n2. Pour the heavy cream into a large mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, mix on medium speed until thick, stiff peaks form.\n3. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into the heavy cream and gently fold everything together with a rubber spatula. Do not over-mix!\n4. Pour the cream mixture into an 8-inch cake pan or loaf pan. Drizzle the reserved \u00bd cup of rhubarb on top and use the rubber spatula to swirl and mix into the cream gently.\n5. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap. The wrap should be completely in contact with the ice cream without air bubbles. Use your hands to pat it down as tightly as possible. If there are air bubbles, ice crystals will form and make the top of your ice cream icy. Be sure the wrap is in contact with the ice cream from edge to edge. Transfer to the freezer until it is completely frozen, at least 4 hours.\n\n**Prepare the tart crust:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350\u00baF.\n2. Place the pecans in a food processor and pulse them into a fine meal. Transfer to a mixing bowl with the flour and powdered sugar. Add \u00bc teaspoon salt.\n3. Melt the butter in the microwave or a small saucepan over the stovetop. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Let stand for 5 minutes. Pour the butter into the bowl of flour and pecans and use a rubber spatula to mix until there are no dry bits of flour and the dough is smooth and moist.\n4. Place the dough into a 10\u201d greased pie dish or tart pan. Use your hands to smooth it into the dish and up the sides in an even layer. Transfer to the oven for 15 minutes. Remove and let stand for 30 minutes. Keep the oven at 350\u00baF.\n\n**Finish the filling:**\n\n1. Add the egg yolks and remaining \u00bd cup sugar to the pot of the remaining rhubarb. Turn the heat back to medium and whisk until completely smooth.\n2. Add the cold, cubed butter and continue whisking until the heat melts the butter completely. It will take 2\u20133 minutes of regular whisking. Continue whisking until completely smooth. Turn off the heat and immediately pour into the prepared crust.\n\n**Bake the tart:**\n\n1. Transfer the tart to the oven for 15 minutes; carefully rotate the tart once midway through cooking.\n2. After 15 minutes, remove from the oven and do a jiggle check. It should be set up around the edges and slightly jiggly in the middle. It should wobble, not slosh. If it\u2019s still very jiggly around the edges, return to the oven and continue baking in 2-minute increments until the tart is set around the edges but still jiggly in the middle. It should not need more than 20 minutes in the oven.\n\n**Finish the tart:**\n\n1. Let the tart stand for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, transfer to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight before serving.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Slice the tart and carefully remove each piece. If you made this in a pie dish, it will be more difficult to serve but not impossible! Dust the tart with powdered sugar and serve with rhubarb ice cream on top. Enjoy!",

Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C). Place the coconut flakes on a baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden. Set aside for later.\r  \n\r  \nPie Crust:\n\n\r  \n1. In a blender, combine the flour, salt, cold butter cubes, and cold vegetable shortening. Pulse a few times until the butter is the size of peas.\r  \n2. Add the first measurement of cold water and pulse a few more times. If the dough doesn't come together, add a little more water.\r  \n3. Transfer the dough onto your work surface and form 2 balls, one larger than the other. Refrigerate the larger ball for 45 minutes. The smaller ball can be frozen for later use.\r  \n\r  \nBaking the Pie Crust:\n\n\r  \n1. Roll out the dough to a thickness of 3mm to fit a 9-inch pie mold.\r  \n2. Poke holes all over the crust with a fork.\r  \n3. Place the crust in the mold and press it down firmly to prevent it from moving while baking.\r  \n4. Trim off the excess dough. Refrigerate for another 30 minutes.\r  \n5. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).\r  \n6. Line the pie crust with parchment paper and add weight on top (e.g., dried white beans).\r  \n7. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the paper and beans.\r  \n8. Bake for an additional 10 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. Set aside to cool.\r  \n\r  \nCoconut Filling:\n\n\r  \n1. In a pot, bring coconut milk, whipping cream, vanilla extract, salt, and sugar to a boil.\r  \n2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and cornstarch until homogeneous.\r  \n3. Gradually add a small amount of the hot mixture to the egg mixture, whisking constantly.\r  \n4. Once the hot mixture is incorporated, pour the egg mixture back into the pot.\r  \n5. Whisk constantly over medium heat until the mixture comes to a boil.\r  \n6. Remove from heat and add 1 cup of the toasted coconut flakes.\r  \n7. Immediately pour the filling into the prepared pie crust. Refrigerate until completely chilled, approximately 3 hours.\r  \n\r  \nTopping: \n\n\r  \n1. Using a hand mixer, whip the whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla extract until firm peaks form.\r  \n2. Cover the chilled pie filling with whipped cream.\r  \n3. Sprinkle the remaining toasted coconut flakes on top.\r  \n4. Cut the pie into slices and enjoy!\r  \n\r  \nCan't wait to see you next week for more exciting recipes!\r  \nSandrine \u2764\ufe0f",

        "recipe_comment":"Hello, friends!\n\nMy recipe for a simple dessert in a glass. [Original recipe and a couple of tips](https:\/\/grillmangal.art\/en\/dessert-in-a-glass\/)\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* Milk \u2013 150 ml\n* Cornstarch \u2013 1 tablespoon (8-10 g)\n* Sugar \u2013 1 tablespoon (15 g)\n* Egg (60-65 g) \u2013 1 piece\n* Vanilla sugar (or extract) \u2013 1 teaspoon (5 g)\n* Cocoa powder \u2013 2 teaspoons (for decoration)\n* Orange \u2013 1 slice (for serving)\n\n**Cooking process:**\n\n1. In a small saucepan, whisk the egg (using a fork or mixer, it\u2019s better to use a mixer for this recipe).\n2. Add the sugar and gradually add all the cornstarch.\n3. Beat well until the sugar is completely dissolved.\n4. Gradually and carefully, while stirring, add the milk. Do it gradually to avoid lumps\n5. Place the saucepan over medium heat and, stirring constantly, bring the mixture to a boil\n6. Reduce the heat and cook, stirring, for another 2-3 minutes until the mixture thickens to the desired consistency.\n7. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the vanilla, and mix well.\n8. Allow the mixture to cool for about 15 minutes.\n9. Transfer the mixture to glasses. According to this recipe, you\u2019ll get exactly 2 glasses\n10. Usually, cocoa powder is used for decoration just before serving, but I like a dark brown crust, so I add cocoa powder while the dessert is still warm. Here\u2019s how to add cocoa powder: Cover the glass halfway with paper or a knife, sprinkle cocoa powder into a sieve, and sift it onto our glass, you can create any pattern you like.\n11. Place the dessert in the refrigerator for 30-40 minutes.\n12. Remove the dessert, decorate with a slice of orange.\n13. Enjoy!\n\nThat\u2019s the whole recipe!\r  \n\r  \nCook with pleasure!",

        "recipe_comment":"This recipe comes from my mother-in-law\u2019s grandmother, Grandma Warner and it\u2019s one I make a few times a year now during strawberry season. Grandma Warner formed them into 3 large biscuits, but I do 4 smaller biscuits to keep it even. No need to change any of the quantities; just make them a bit smaller.\n\nYou can make them precisely as listed above and they\u2019ll be delicious and easy. I use butter instead of shortening. Right before baking, I also brush the tops with melted butter and sprinkle on a bit of turbinado sugar.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 pint strawberries or mixed berries\n* 1\u20132 tablespoons granulated sugar\n* 1 cup sifted flower\n* \u00bd teaspoon salt\n* 2 teaspoons baking powder\n* 2 tablespoons shortening or cold butter\n* Whole milk, about 5\u20136 tablespoons or so\n* 1 tablespoon melted butter\n* Pinch of turbinado sugar, optional\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 1 tablespoon vanilla pudding powder, optional\n\n**Before starting:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 425\u00baF. Set aside a baking sheet for the biscuits.\n\n**Prepare the berries:**\n\n1. Rinse the berries and transfer them to a saucepan. Sprinkle 1\u20132 tablespoons sugar on top. Turn the heat to medium. As soon as the berries begin to bubble, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15\u201320 minutes. Lightly mash a few of the berries to thicken the syrup further. Turn off the heat and set aside.\n\n**Prepare the biscuits:**\n\n1. Combine the sifted flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Cut in the shortening or butter using a fork or your fingers until the mixture becomes crumbly, the size of peas.\n2. Work in the milk, a few tablespoons at a time, until it becomes a soft, sticky dough.\n3. Form the dough into 4 rough biscuits. They don\u2019t need to be rolled into perfect circles; the rough edges will crisp up and be better than perfect dough balls!\n4. Transfer the biscuits to the baking sheet. Brush each biscuit with melted butter and sprinkle a pinch of turbinado sugar on top of each biscuit.\n5. Transfer to the oven for 11\u201312 minutes. The bottoms will be golden brown and the the top will be a very light golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.\n\n**Prepare the whipped cream:**\n\n1. While the biscuits bake, place the cream in a large bowl with the vanilla extract. If you\u2019d like a more stabilized whipped cream, add the vanilla pudding powder. Using a hand mixer, mix on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1.

Preheat oven to 325F (300F convection oven). Gather a 9\" springform pan, set aside.\n\nChocolate Cookie Crust\n\n1. In a medium bowl, combine chocolate cookie crumbs with sugar and melted butter. Pour cookie crumb mixture into your 9\" springform pan. Press crumbs into the base of your pan. Set aside.\n\nCheesecake\n\n1. In a large bowl, using a hand mixer, beat together softened cream cheese with granulated sugar. Mix until just combined.\n2. Add eggs, one at a time, until mixture is smooth and creamy. Add vanilla and salt.\n3. In a small bowl, add hot heavy cream to white chocolate. Let stand for 2-3min then stir until chocolate is melted. Add chocolate mixture to egg\/cheesecake mixture. You want a mixture that is smooth and creamy.\n4. Meanwhile, add sugar to thawed berries. Mix until combined. Let stand for 1-2 min to allow the sugar to dissolve into the berries.\n\nAssembly &amp; Baking\n\n1. Pour half of the cheesecake mixture into the springform pan with cookie crust. Add spoonfuls of raspberry to the surface of the cheesecake mixture, swirl with a knife. Add remaining 1\/2 of cheesecake mixture, and repeat raspberry dolloping process. Use a toothpick\/knife to swirl through the mixture, creating a spiral design.\n2. Place springform pan onto baking sheet, to collect any leaks of oil during baking. Bake in a oven preheated to 325F for 1h 30-40 minutes or until mixture gently set at the edges and is slightly wobbly in the centre. Turn off oven and allow cheesecake to cool in the oven. (Note: I recommend partially propping open the door of your oven to allow heat to slowly escape while cheesecake cools).\n3. Once cheesecake is cool to room temperature, place in the refrigerator to set for ~4h to overnight.\n\nDecorations\n\n1. Remove the rim of your springform pan. Place cheesecake on flat surface.\n2. In a small bowl mix 1 cup of thawed frozen raspberries with 2 tsp of sugar. Stir until combined. Let sit for 1-2 minutes until sugar is dissolved.\n3. In a medium bowl, combine heavy cream with sugar, and vanilla extract. Whip to a light, airy, whipped cream texture. Set aside.\n4. Dollop additional raspberry sauce on surface of the cheesecake (note: I like adding additional raspberry mixture to the raspberry dollops\/cracks in the cheesecake) and decorate cheesecake with pipped Chantilly cream. Top with additional raspberries, and shaved white chocolate, as desired!\n5. Cut, serve, and enjoy!",

Scald the milk (bring it to a boil and immediately remove from heat). Allow it to cool to a warm (not hot) temperature (\\~110-115\u00baF).\n2. Add the yeast to the milk and mix well. Set aside and rest for 5-7 minutes.\n3. In a stand mixer bowl, add flour, butter, granulated sugar, eggs, salt, and activated yeast mixture. With a dough hook, stir, then then knead on low for about 15-20 minutes, just before it reaches window pane texture.\n4. Turn out the dough onto a prep surface and knead until it has a window pane texture (when thinned out, light comes through it without the dough breaking).\n5. Form dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for 60-90 minutes until doubled in size.\n\nWhile dough is rising, prepare the filling:\n\n1. mix brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl until fully mixed. \n2. Add the butter, and mix until incorporated. Set aside.\n\nOnce the dough has finished rising:\n\n1. Turn out the dough onto prep surface. Flatten to remove the air bubbles.\n2. Roll the dough out into approx. 1\u201d\/2cm thick in a rectangular shape, then fold and press it into thirds. \n3. Flip the dough and roll out to a 12x18\u201d\/30x45cm rectangle, about 1\/2\u201d1cm thick.\n4. Spread filling evenly onto rolled dough, leaving a 1\/2\u201d\/1cm edge.\n5. With a wheel pastry cutter or pizza cutter, cut the dough into thirds (widthwise, perpendicular to the longer side), then cut each third into thirds again to make 9 rolls.\n6. Roll each strip and tuck the end into the roll. Place the rolls, tucked side down, into a 9x13\u201d\/22x33cm baking dish lined with parchment paper.\n7. Tent the rolls with plastic wrap, and let them rise again for 15-30 minutes.\n8. While rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 350\u00baF\/180\u00baC.\n\nWhile the oven preheats, prepare the icing:\n\n1. Beat cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar until smooth. Set aside.\n\nOnce the oven is preheated:\n\n1. Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes, until lightly golden on the top.\n2. Immediately after removing the rolls from the oven, spread a layer of icing onto them.\n\nServe warm, add additional icing if desired.",

Skip the lemon juice if the apples are already sour enough.\n\n**2.** In a separate mixing bowl, whisk 1 egg and 3 tbsp of sugar until pale yellow, which should take around 2 minutes.\n\n**3.** Add 1 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, and milk. Whisk the mixture until it's smooth and free of lumps. If the batter seems too thick, add 20ml more milk. Keep in mind that higher protein flour absorbs more liquid.\n\n**4.** Fold in the diced apples and mix them into the batter. (Alternatively you can grate them instead for different texture)\n\n**5.** Heat a frying pan over medium heat with 1 tbsp of oil. Add 2 tbsp of pancake mix to the pan, and spread it slightly into the desired shape. Fry the pancake on each side for around 2 minutes.

Pipe one layer of cream in the bottom of the serving cup or bowl. \n2. Completely dunk a biscuit in the coffee, turning it over to make sure it is saturated, and layer it on top of the cream layer. Repeat and top with a final cream layer.\n3. The layers should be: cream, biscuit, cream, biscuit, and one final cream layer. Dust the top with cocoa powder and serve.\n\nNote:  \nTo enhance the coffee flavor, pour a bit of the coffee on top of each saturated biscuit layer before piping cream over it.",

        "recipe_comment":"These easy fluffy and soft [ube cinnamon rolls](https:\/\/cookwithchung.com\/ube-cinnamon-rolls\/) from scratch!\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\nDough\n\n* \u00be cup milk (warmed)\n* 1 large egg, at room temperature\n* 1 tsp ube extract\n* 6 tbsp unsalted butter (softened) 85g\n* 3 \u00bc cup all-purpose flour (scooped and levelled) 406.25g\n* 1\/3 cup granulated sugar\n* \u00bc tsp salt\n* 1 package of instant dry yeast (8g or 2 \u00bc tsp)\n\nUbe Cinnamon Filling\n\n* 1\/3 cup ube halaya jam\n* \u00bc cup brown sugar\n* 1 tbsp ground cinnamon\n* 1 tbsp unsalted butter (softened)\n* 1\/3 cup heavy cream (Pour over the risen rolls)\n\nCream Cheese Frosting\n\n* \u00bd cup cream cheese\n* 2 tbsp unsalted butter (Softened)\n* \u00bd tsp vanilla extract\n* 1\/8 tsp salt\n* 2\/3 cup of confection sugar\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n1. **Prepare the dough.** Warm the milk and add to your stand mixer bowl and add the yeast. Stir and let it sit for a few minutes. Add eggs, butter and sugar and mix with the flat beater paddle attachment until well combined. Add in salt and 3 \u00bc cup (406 grams) of all-purpose flour and mix using the beater paddle for 1 minute. Scrape the dough off the attachment and switch to the dough hook. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes.  \\*The dough should be slightly sticking to the side of the mixing bowl\\*\n2. **Proof the dough.** Lightly spray oil in a large bowl. Use a spatula to transfer the dough from the mixing bowl to the greased bowl. Place the dough in a warm corner or I use the proofing setting on my oven and let it proof for 30 minutes. \\*The dough is ready when it has doubled in size. The time will vary depending on how warm the corner is. Avoid letting it rise too much otherwise, the rolls will be airy\\*\n3. **Prepare Ube Cinnamon Filling.** In a small mixing bowl, combine the soft butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and ube halaya jam mixing until well combined. Set aside.\n4. **Roll the dough out.** Sprinkle a clean surface with flour. Turn out the dough onto the surface. Punch the air out of the dough. Flour a rolling pin and roll the dough to about a 15\u00d712\" rectangle. You may need to stretch it so the corners are even.\n5. **Spread ube cinnamon filling.** Use a spatula and evenly spread out the ube cinnamon filling over the whole dough rectangle.\n6. **Roll the dough.** On the long end of the dough use both hands and start rolling the edge up and tightly tuck it in and roll it all the way until you get a nice long log.\n7. **Mark and cut into rolls.** Mark the top of the log into equal third portions. Within those 1\/3 portions mark equal third portions. There should be 9 equal markings. Use a sharp serrated knife or dental floss to cut the rolls.\n8. **Place in pan and let it rise.** Grease the 9-inch pan and place the rolls 3 x 3. Let it rise for 30 minutes. I proof in my oven at 100 degrees. Let the rolls expand so its fills the empty space between the rolls.\n9. **Pour heavy cream over rolls.** Once the rolls have proof more pour the heavy cream all over the top and let it absorb. \n10. **Bake.** Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake the rolls for 21-23 minutes. The top of the buns should be lightly browned. \n11. **Prepare cream cheese frosting.** While the ube cinnamon rolls are baking prepare the cream cheese frosting. Using the KitchenAid stand mixer or hand mixer whip the soft butter, cream cheese until its well blended. Add the vanilla extract, salt and confection sugar and blend until creamy texture.\n12. **Spread the frosting.** Spread the cream cheese frosting over the cooled ube cinnamon rolls.",

It is perfect for any occasion and very quick in preparation.\n\nOriginally posted [here](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/cr%C3%A8me-br%C3%BBl%C3%A9e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPreparation time: 10min\n\nBaking time: 35-40 minutes.\n\nCooling time: 1h 10min\n\nRecipe makes: 6 portions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n\\* 420 ml (14.8oz) of double cream\n\n\\* 100ml (3.5oz) of milk (full fat works best)\n\n\\* 1 tsp of vanilla bean paste\n\n\\* 5 medium egg yolks\n\n\\* 70g (2.45oz) of caster sugar (plus extra for topping)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**1.** Heat the oven to a 160C fan (320F).\n\n**2.** Place 6, 100ml ramekins into a baking dish, one deep enough that you can cover with tin foil without touching the top of the ramekins.\n\n**3.** Pour double cream and milk into a small pan, and whisk in 1 tsp of vanilla bean paste.\n\n**4.** Put the egg yolks and sugar in a mixing bowl and whisk until combined.\n\n**5.** Put the pan with the cream on medium heat and bring it to 80C\/176F. As soon as you see bubbles appear, take the pan off the heat (do not boil). Pour the cream mixture into a jug to stop it from heating up more.\n\n**6.** Slowly and in stages pour the hot cream into the beaten egg yolk mixture, stirring with a spoon as you do so. (Do not rush or add too quickly as this will result in scrambled eggs)\n\n**7.** Using a big spoon, scoop off all the foam that is sitting on top of the liquid and discard. Pour the mixture back into a jug.\n\n**8.** Pour enough hot tap water into the baking dish to come about 3\/4 up the sides of the ramekins. Pour the hot cream into the ramekins.\n\n**9.** Place tin foil on the top of a baking dish leaving a small gap on both sides of the container. This will allow air to circulate.\n\n**10.** Place the covered dish in the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes until the mixture is softly set. To check, gently sway the roasting tin and if the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es are ready, they will wobble a bit like jelly in the middle. Don\u2019t let them get too firm or too runny.\n\n**11.** Once ready, lift the ramekins out of the baking dish with oven gloves and set them on a wire rack to cool for a couple of minutes, then put them in the fridge to cool completely (1 hour). This can be done overnight as well.\n\n**12.** Before serving, sprinkle 1,5 tsp of caster sugar over each ramekin and spread it out with the back of a spoon to completely cover.\n\n**13.** Use a blow torch to caramelise the sugar. Hold the flame just above the sugar and keep moving it round and round until caramelised.\n\n**Insight:**\n\n\\* If no blow torch is available, set your oven on the grill. Place ramekins on a baking tray and caramelise watching carefully not to burn the sugar too much.\n\n\\* Egg yolk sets at a temperature between 62-65C (144F-149F)\n\n\\* You can keep your Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e in the fridge for up to 5 days, and cover it with cling film to avoid smell exchange.\n\n\\* For the premium Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, I recommend using organic eggs as their flavour is much better than standard eggs.",

Roughly 3-5 minutes depending on your food processor. Add the sugar and blend for 2 minutes on high. Once it is well blended add the softened unsalted butter and blend until well incorporated. Refrigerate the black sesame filling for 25-30 minutes. \n2. **Refrigerate filling.** When the filling is hard take it out and divide it into 20 equal portions. The black sesame filling weighed 220 grams (I divided them into 11-12 grams each). Roll them into balls and put them back in the fridge. \n\nPrepare the dough\n\n1. **Combined flour and water.** Add the glutinous rice flour to a medium size bowl. Pour half the warm water and stir until all the water is absorbed. Add the second half and stir until all the water is absorbed into the flour.\n2. **Knead dough.** Using your hands knead the dough until it\u2019s well incorporated. The dough should be soft and smooth. Add more water if the dough is cracking and if the dough is too wet and sticky add more flour. \n3. **Divide in half and mix ube extract.** The total weight of my dough was 210 grams so I weighed half (Approximately 105 grams) and added the ube extract and knead the dough until the purple color was well mixed into the dough.\n4. **Portion out 20 rice balls.** Take the white dough and divide it into 10 equal portions and roll them into balls. If using a scale weigh 10-11 grams for each rice ball. Repeat for the purple dough. You should have a total of 20 rice balls.\n\nAssemble the tangyuan\n\n1. **Take out filling in batches.** Work in batches with the black sesame fillings. Take out of the fridge 5 at a time while you assemble. This is to prevent the filling from melting.\n2. **Assemble.** Flatten the rice ball in your hands by pressing your palms down. Using your thumb and make a slight dent in the centre so the sesame filling will sit snug use both sets of hands or use your fingers to gently wrap the edge up and around the top until it\u2019s completely sealed. Alternatively, make a circle with your thumb and index finger and place the tang yuan in the middle and gently wrap it up. Both methods will work. Repeat until all of them have been assembled.\n\nMake the sweet ginger pandan broth\n\n1. **Boil ginger and pandan leaves.** Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the sliced ginger and pandan leaves and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the sugar and let it simmer until the sugar has dissolved.\n\nCook\n\n1. **Cook tang yuan in sweet soup.** Add the tang yuan to the water and gently stir so it does not stick to the bottom of the pot. Once the tang yuan floats to the top it is ready. This will take about 4-5 minutes.\n2. **Serve.** Serve with sweet ginger pandan soup.",

        "recipe_comment":"I had a bunch of peaches that were sitting around for a little too long so I decided to make some peach cobbler to use them up.  This is such a simple dessert to bring together with really simple ingredients.  \n\nRecipe Page:  https:\/\/nate-cooks.com\/index.php\/2023\/01\/11\/peach-cobbler\/\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\nPEACHES:\n\n* 5 or 6 peaches depending on size\n* 3\/4 cup granulated sugar\n* 1\/4 teaspoon salt\n\nFOR THE BATTER: \n\n* 6 tbsp unsalted butter\n* 1 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1 cup granulated sugar\n* 2 tsp baking powder\n* 1\/2 teaspoon salt\n* 3\/4 cup milk\n* 1 tsp ground cinnamon\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Cut an 'X' in the bottom of your peaches and place them in some boiling water for about 4 minutes.  This will help you remove the skins if you don't want to peel them another way.\n2. Once the skins are removed you can slice them around the pit and separate the halves, and then cut the halves into slices.\n3. Add the sliced peaches, sugar and salt to a saucepan and stir to combine.   You'll cook the peach mixture for about 5 minutes or until the peaches start to break down and the sugar is all dissolved.\n4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.\n5. Cut your butter into tablespoon pieces and add them to the bottom of a 9 x 13 in baking dish.  And then add your dish to the preheating oven until the butter is melted and is slightly browned.\n6. In a bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.\n7. Mix in the milk, until the batter is smooth, but don't over mix. Pour the batter into the pan with the melted butter.  And if needed spread out the batter so it is as even as you can make it in the pan.\n8. Add the peaches and juice from the pan over the batter making sure to add them as lightly as possible so they don't sink too far down into the batter.  And make sure you do not mix the peaches in.  You want the peaches to be sitting on top. 9.Dust your cinnamon on top of your peaches.\n9. Bake at 350 degrees for about 38-40 minutes.  The top will be starting to brown and the bottom will be bubbling.  Let cool for about 10 minutes so it has a chance to setup a little.\n10. Then scoop out a portion and I like to top it with some vanilla ice cream.  Dust with more cinnamon if you'd like, and enjoy!",

In a large bowl, combine 2 cups of flour with sugar and yeast. Whisk to sift and aerate the mixture. Set aside.\n2. In a heat proof bowl\/cup, heat butter together with milk in a microwave for 45 seconds (Note: not all the butter will be melted! The milk should be warm to the touch but not hot. If the mixture is hot, let it cool slightly before adding to the yeast\/flour mixture).\n3. Add the milk\/butter mixture and egg to the flour\/yeast mixture. Mix together with a wooden spoon until a thick, wet mixture is formed. Add an additional 2 cups of flour and mix to fully incorporate. Finally, add an additional 1\/2 cup of flour until a soft dough is formed.\n4. Knead together dough until it becomes homogenous, smooth, and soft. (Note: if the dough continues to stick to your fingers, add an additional 1\/4 cup of flour and incorporate it into the dough). The final mixture should bounce back after a finger is indented into it. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes, uncovered.\n5. Roll dough into a 15\" by 12\" rectangle.\n\nCinnamon Filling &amp; Assembly\n\n1. Spread softened butter over surface of the dough rectangle, leaving a 1\/2\" border that is butter free.\nCombine brown sugar with cinnamon. Sprinkle cinnamon mixture over butter layer.\n2. Roll dough from the 15\" end into a thick log. Once rolling is complete, gently push together both ends of the log to make them even. Divide dough into 12 pieces by scoring the surface of the log. Using an unflavoured piece of floss, slide floss underneath log and pull up to cut log (Note: this step prevents squishing the cinnamon rolls during the cutting process).\n3. Place cinnamon rolls into a buttered 9\"x13\" pan. Cover with a towel and place in a warm location to proof for 1 hour.\n4. Preheat oven to 350F (325F convection oven). Bake for 30-35 minutes or until edges are golden brown. Let cool for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the cream cheese frosting.\n\nCream Cheese Frosting\n\n1. In a medium sized bowl, combine softened butter with cream cheese. Start by mashing with a fork\/spoon until creamy. Add powdered sugar and vanilla paste\/extract then mix together until mixture resembles a clumpy paste. Finally, use a whisk to beat together icing.\n2. Spread a generous layer of cream cheese icing onto the tops of the warm cinnamon rolls. Serve and enjoy!",

Heat the oven to 175\u00b0C (350\u00b0F). Grease a 23cm (9-inch) springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.\n2. In a food processor, blitz 300g (10.5oz) biscuits until finely ground. Add 1 tablespoon brown sugar and \u00bc teaspoon salt, and process until combined. Slowly pour in 120g (\u00bd cup \/ 1 stick) melted butter and process again until combined \u2013 the mixture will look like wet sand. (If you don\u2019t have a food processor, place biscuits, sugar and salt in a ziplock bag and crush with a heavy plate or rolling pin, before pouring butter into bag and massaging the bag until the butter coats the crumbs.)\n3. Press the mixture into the bottom and of the prepared pan with a flat-bottomed measuring cup or mug. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature.\n\nFilling &amp; assembly:\n\n1. Cut 3 pieces of heavy-duty kitchen foil and put them in criss cross on the work surface. Set springform pan in the middle and wrap the edges of the foil around the sides of the pan. This will prevent the water from the water bath seeping in. Keep the oven at 175\u00b0C (350\u00b0F).\n2. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, in a large bowl, beat 680g (24oz) cream cheese until fluffy. Add 4 eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Add 200g (1 cup) of sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and mix well, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.\n3. In a small cup, mix 2 tablespoons of hojicha powder with 2 tablespoon of water until a thick paste forms. Scoop 4 tablespoons of cheesecake mix into the cup and mix with the hojicha paste until combined. Pour the hojicha mix into the large bowl and stir into cheesecake mix until combined. The mixture will be a light shade of brown.\n4. Pour the filling into the prepared crumb crust. Place the pan (with aluminium foil on the outside) on a high-walled baking sheet and into the oven. Pour hot water into the baking sheet so the water comes up to the halfway mark of the springform pan. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, until the cake is just set in the center. Gently remove the cake from the oven but do not turn the oven off.\n5. In a medium bowl, whisk 450ml (16 oz) sour cream and 1 tablespoon of sugar. To a smaller bowl, scoop out 2 tablespoons of sour cream and sift 2 teaspoons of matcha powder; mix until combined. Add this matcha-sour cream mix to the medium bowl and stir to combine. Spoon the sour cream mixture onto the cheesecake and spread with the back of the spoon. Return pan to the oven and continue to bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until the sour cream layer is set and warmed through.\n6. Switch off the oven and open the oven door an inch or so. Leave the cake in the oven until it cools to room temperature (around 1h) to prevent cracks. Remove cheesecake from the oven and store it in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or ideally overnight.",

        "recipe_comment":"[Matcha Puff Pastry Christmas Tree](https:\/\/cookwithchung.com\/matcha-puff-pastry-christmas-tree\/)\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 2 sheets puff pastry (I use 10-inch X 10-inch sheets)\n* 2 tsp matcha powder (Ceremonial or Culinary Grade)\n* 3 tsp condensed milk\n* 1 tbsp hot milk\n* 1 egg yolk (for egg wash)\n* icing sugar (Optional)\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n**Defrost puff pastry and mix the matcha mixture**\n\n1. Take out of the freezer 2 hours before you plan to start making the Christmas tree puff. Let it defrost on the counter.\n2. . Prepare the matcha mixture by combining hot milk with sifted matcha powder. Stir until it\u2019s mixed well. Add the condensed milk to the matcha and stir until well combined. Set aside until the puff pastry is ready to use.\n\n**Prepare puff pastry and cut it into a tree shape**\n\n1. Prepare the puff pastry. Take the puff pastry and unroll. Use a rolling pin to roll out creases. The puff pastry sheets I get in stores come in squares (10-inch X 10-inch). It will very dependent on where you\u2019re located. I have seen puff pastry sheets come in a rectangular shape.\n2. Cut puff pastry into a tree shape. There are two methods for cutting out the tree shape. I would suggest placing both sheets on top and cutting them. You can also cut them separately.\n\n**Method 1 - Wing it**\n\n1. Cut the slits for the tree trunk at the bottom. In the middle cut \u00bd inch slits on left and right. The trunk will be 1 inch in height.\n2. To create the tree top place three marks. The first mark on the top of the puff pastry. The second and third will be on the left and right sides of the puff pastry 1 inch from the bottom.\n3. Cut the diagonal lines from the top to the left and right. Cut the bottoms horizontally ensuring to keep the tree truck intact.\n\n**Method 2 - Create and use a template**\n\n1. Use parchment paper and cut out the exact same size as the puff pastry.\n2. On the parchment paper cut the slits for the tree trunk at the bottom. In the middle cut \u00bd inch slits on the left and right. The trunk will be 1 inch in height.\n3. To create the tree top place three marks. The first mark on the top of the puff pastry. The second and third will be on the left and right sides of the puff pastry 1 inch from the bottom.\n4. Cut the diagonal lines from the top to the left and right. Cut the bottoms horizontally ensuring to keep the truck intact.\n5. Place the parchment paper on top of the puff pastry and cut the puff pastry ensuring to cut along the outside of the parchment paper.\n\n**Spread matcha mixture, cut and twist branches**\n\n1. Spread the matcha spread. Place one sheet of the Christmas tree on your baking sheet with parchment paper and spread the matcha mixture. Place the second cut sheet of puff pastry on top.\n2. Cut and twist the branches. On both sides cut horizontally from both sides but leave one inch in the centre uncut to keep the Christmas tree intact. DO NOT CUT all the way through. I cut the horizontal lines approximately 1 inch apart. Then start twisting. Press the edges of the twisted branches down at the ends.\n\n**Egg wash, bake, and top with matcha mixture\/icing sugar**\n\n1. Using a brush to cover the top of the puff pastry with egg wash to give it a nice golden color.\n2. Preheat oven to 375 \u00b0 F. Bake for 15 minutes or until the entire Christmas tree puff is puffed up.\n3. Cool and top if icing sugar. Take the puff pastry out of the oven and let it cool on the baking tray for 5 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and with the extra matcha mixture, I brush it lightly over the puff pastry and dust with some icing sugar.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n\\- With the extra puff pastry I used it to make Matcha Puff Pastry Twist. Cut the puff pastry into 1-inch wide strips and brush the matcha mixture and twist.\n\n\\- If the puff pastry is larger in size double up on the matcha mixture so there is enough to brush between the puff pastry and on top of the tree after it's done baking.\n\nENJOY!",

Brown the butter first Get a saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Add the butter and brown for approximately 6-8 minutes, or until you see brown bits at the bottom and a little bit of white foaming action on the surface. Once you see this turn the heat off and remove it from the stove. Let it cool down completely.\n2. In a small mixing bowl combine the all-purpose flour, salt, baking soda and matcha. Using a sifter sift the ingredients to remove any clumps. The matcha will oftentimes be clumped together. Sifting it will ensure the matcha is evenly mixed to create a vibrant green color.\n3. Take a mixing bowl and add the butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar and mix until well mixed. Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix until you get a nice light creamy texture. Use a stand mixer to help mix it faster, but a hand mixer will also work fine. It will just take an extra minute or two to get the texture.\n4. Add the sifted dry ingredients to the wet and mix with a spatula. Hand mixing will ensure the dough will not raise and fall flat in the oven by adding excess air to the dough.\n5. Add the white chocolate chips and mix until well incorporated into the dough.\n6. Use a cookie scoop\/ice cream scoop 3 tablespoons to scoop the cookie dough (I get 8 cookies with this recipe). I let the cookies rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.\n7. Take the cookies out of the fridge and preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.\n8. Cover your baking sheet with parchment paper and place the cookie dough 3 inches apart. Since this recipe uses less butter I like to roll the dough and press it down to give it a cookie flatten shape. Bake for 10-12 minutes. Take it out of the oven immediately and let it rest for 10 minutes on the baking sheet.\n9. Move the cookies to a cooling rack. Enjoy!",

        "recipe_comment":"# Easy Candied Pecans\n\nThese cinnamon sugar roasted pecans are so easy to whip up in big batches. I like to make a bunch around the holidays and give them to friends and family as gifts.\n\nOriginal Recipe: [https:\/\/craftycookbook.com\/easy-candied-pecans\/](https:\/\/craftycookbook.com\/easy-candied-pecans\/#recipe)\n\n**Ingredients** \n\n* 1 lb raw pecan halves\r\n* 1 egg white, room temp\r\n* 1 cup white sugar\r\n* 1 tsp ground cinnamon\r\n* 1.5 tsp salt\r\n* 1 tbsp water\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 250\u00b0 F.\r\n2. In a small bowl combine the sugar, salt, and cinnamon, mix until fully combined.\r\n3. Add the egg white and water to a large mixing bowl and whip them together until the mixture is frothy (I do this by tilting the bowl at an angle and vigorously whipping a fork or whisk side to side).\r\n4. Once the egg white mixture is frothy, add the pecans and toss until they\u2019re evenly coated. Dust about \u2153 of the cinnamon sugar mixture over top, mix well, then repeat until all of the sugar is used, and the pecans are evenly coated.\r\n5. Line a large cookie sheet or jelly roll pan with parchment paper or foil. Spread coated pecans onto the sheet, getting them as evenly spread out as possible. If you are making a double batch, use two cookie sheets.\r\n6. Bake for 1 hour. Once every 15 minutes as the pecans bake, remove them from the oven and mix them around on the sheet.\r\n7. After baking, allow the pecans to cool on the cookie sheet for at least 15 minutes before serving. The pecans will harden and change in appearance slightly as they cool (going from glossy to their finished texture).\r\n8. Wait until the pecans are completely cooled down to put them into any containers. Store at room temp in a sealed container for up to 3 weeks.\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear your feedback in the comment section!**",

        "recipe_comment":"**Meringue Roulade with Lemon Curd, Berries &amp; Crushed Pistachio**\n\nServes 8 - 10\n\nIf you would like to make your own lemon curd for this roulade my recipe can be found on my website [here](https:\/\/www.leviathanfood.com\/recipes\/lemon-curd). I would also really appreciate any follows on social media channels if you like the site!\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 6 large egg whites\n* 335g caster sugar (super fine sugar in the US)\n* 300ml rich double cream\n* 180ml lemon curd\n* 250g raspberries\n* 250g blueberries\n* 70g crushed de-shelled pistachios\n* 2 passion fruit\n* fresh mint\n\n**METHOD**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 150\u00b0C (300\u00b0F). Line a flat tray with parchment paper, you will be baking the meringue on this and don't want it to stick to the surface. I use a 38cm \u00d7 35cm tray, but you can use any large flat rectangular tray that will fit into your oven. You will be rolling along the longer edge, so this will be the finished length of your roulade.\n2. Add the egg whites and half the caster sugar to a bowl, making sure that it's clean and completely dry before beginning. If there is any moisture left in the bowl, the egg whites won't form. whisk the mixture until it's formed light peaks. Once they have formed, gradually add the other half of the sugar until it forms stiff glossy peaks. This will take about 10-15 minutes. \n3. Spread the meringue mixture evenly onto the lined tray, squaring off the edges as best you can. Place in the oven and bake for one hour. It should be a very light golden colour when it's done. \n4. Remove tray from the oven and turn upside down onto a fresh sheet of parchment paper. Carefully peel off the backing sheet, working slowly and with a knife to scrape the paper gently away in one piece. There will be pockets of carmelised sugar stuck to the paper you want to get all those pieces off as they add a lovely gooey texture. \n5. Whip the double cream until thick and gently fold in the lemon curd, keeping the air you've incorporated during whipping. Spread the cream and curd mix over the flat meringue and cover with a layer of raspberries and blueberries, about 2\/3 of the amount. \n6. Make a light score with a knife about 2cm in along one long edge of the meringue, this is going to help you as a starting point to roll it. From the indent, gently roll inwards away from yourself, using the paper underneath to help turn it as you go. You shouldn't be touching the surface of the meringue with your hands, use the paper to do that for you. The \"seam' will sit on the bottom once it's rolled. The outer surface will crack a little bit, you can patch it up if need be once it's served. \n7. When the roll is almost complete, grab the paper and use it to help you transfer the roulade to a plate. It's helpful if you have someone to give you a hand shifting it onto the serving plate, they can hold the plate steady while you transfer. Decorate with the remaining berries, crushed pistachios, passion fruit and mint.",

Preheat the oven to 225F (200F Convection bake). Line 2x baking pans with parchment paper. Set aside.\n2. In the clean bowl of an electric stand mixer, add the egg whites (carefully separated from yolks to ensure no oily, yolk residue).\n3. Add the cream or tartar and salt to the bowl. Begin mixing on low. Once frothy, gradually increase the speed to high and begin slowly adding in the sugar (1 tablespoon at a time)\n4. After all of the sugar has been incorporated, add the vanilla and peppermint extract.    \nOnce a stiff peak consistency has been achieved, turn off mixture. \n5. Add small dollops of meringue to the corners of your baking sheet, to prevent the parchment paper from sliding. \n6. Transfer meringue to a piping bag fitted with a large star attachment or with a piping tip of your choice. For added colour, you can add streaks of red gel food colouring to your piping bag before loading with meringue. As you pipe meringue the colour will deposit creating a swirled effect!\n7. Pipe your meringues allowing at least an inch of space between each. Bake the meringues on the centre rack of the oven, at 225F for \\~1.5 hours. Turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside for an extra 1-2 hour with the door propped open to allow for continued drying. \n8. Dip cooled meringues in melted chocolate then cover in crushed peppermint candies.\n9. Let cool fully and enjoy!",

Activate the yeast. Mix the dry yeast with the warm water and half a teaspoon of the sugar and set aside for 5 minutes.\n2. In a bowl, sift 145g of the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar, and salt. Set aside.\n3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg with the warm milk, melted butter, and vanilla. \n4. Once the yeast is activated, pour yeast mixture and egg mixture into the bowl with dry ingredients and mix well. The mixture will be wet.\n5. Sift the remaining 200g of flour into the bowl and mix until incorporated.\n6. Turn out the dough onto your working surface and knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is elastic and springy. At the beginning, if the dough is very sticky, lightly sprinkle flour to the prep surface (do not exceed 1 tsp of flour).\n7. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover. Allow to rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in size. \n8. Make the filling while the dough is rising.\n9. While the filling cools, turn back to the dough. \n10. Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto prep surface and press out air bubbles.\n11. Shape into a 1\u201d thick rectangle and divide evenly into 6 pieces.\n12. Roll out each piece into a ball and flatten and shape into a bowl shape.\n13. Spoon about one heaping teaspoon of filling into the dough bowl and wrap the dough around the filling, pinching tightly to avoid the filling from oozing out. Flatten a bit.\n14. Place each filled bun onto a baking sheet and cover. Allow to rest for 30 minutes. While the dough is rising, make the icing.\n15. Once the dough has risen a second time, heat the vegetable oil to 375\u00baF\/190\u00baC.\n16. Gently lower doughnuts into the oil and fry for 90-120 seconds per side. Make sure that the oil temp stays at temperature. Do not crowd the pot.\n17. While the doughnuts are still hot, dip each one into the icing and place them onto a baking sheet. The icing should firm (not harden) by the time the doughnuts are cool enough to eat.\n18. To serve, you can also spoon a bit of the filling on top of the doughnut.  \n\n*Filling*\n\n1. Combine peeled and chopped apple in a pot with brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and sugar. \n2. Heat on the stove on medium heat until the mixture has thickened and the sauce has a syrupy texture.\n3.

        "recipe_comment":"A while back I posted a recipe for a lemon dessert and some people asked if they could make something similar with limes. So here's the lime jellies recipe (they're very sour!). As always, you can watch the [detailed video here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/6_2f7OXR8iI) (I'd appreciate it if you'd take a look).\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 920 grams (32.5 oz) of limes\n* 180 grams (6 oz) of lemons\n* 25 grams (1 oz) of gelatine\n* 140-180 grams (5-6 oz) of sugar\n* 1 gram (1\/2 tsp) of vanillin\n* green food colouring (optional)\n\n**Cooking method:**\n\n1. Remove the zest from 2 limes. Then cut all the limes and lemons in half and squeeze the juice out of them (you should have about 400 ml or 1 &amp; 2\/3 cup).\n2. Pour half of the juice into a saucepan. Add the zest, vanilla and sugar (140 to 180 grams, depending on how sweet you want your jellies).\n3. Add the gelatin to the second half of the juice. Stir and leave it for 15 to 30 minutes.\n4. Put the saucepan with the first part of the juice on the fire and bring to a boil. Once boiling, simmer for 2-3 minutes, and then remove from the heat.\n5. Combine both parts of the juice and mix well. Add the food coloring if desired. Then take a mold, cover it with clingfilm and pour the juice into it through a sieve. Put it in the fridge until completely solidified (I recommend leaving it for 1-2 days).\n6. When the jelly sets, take it out of the form and cut into cubes. Dessert is ready, enjoy! Be sure to store it in the fridge.",

Peel the pumpkin and cut into cubes. Put it in a saucepan and add the ground cinnamon, cloves, sugar and cream.\r\n2. Put on high heat and bring to a boil. When it begins to boil - reduce the heat and simmer for about 13-17 minutes. Then blend the pumpkin until smooth.\r\n3. In a bowl, whisk 4 egg yolks. Then slowly add them to the pumpkin, mixing constantly. Cook for 5 minutes over medium heat, stirring all the time.\r\n4. Pour the mixture into a bowl and place in the freezer for 5-6 hours. Stir it every 30-50 minutes to ensure the ice cream freezes evenly. I recommend using salted peanuts as decoration!\n\n**Cooking method for banana \ud83c\udf4c ice cream:**\r\n\nCut the banana into pieces and put it in the freezer for 4 hours. Then mix them in a blender with the sugar and cream. Add any topping (for example, pieces of chocolate or strawberries), pour it into a mold and put it in the freezer for 5 hours.

Remove the zest of 3 limes and squeeze out the juice. Whisk the cream in a bowl. Then add the mixture from the first step, the lime zest and lime juice one at a time, stirring each time. Place the ice cream in a container and place it in the freezer for 5 hours. Also, like the previous ice creams, this should be stirred every 30-50 minutes so it freezes evenly.",

In a mixer bowl, beat eggs, 100g caster sugar, and vanilla.\n2. Put the mixer bowl in a warm water bath and mix well until the mix has warmed.\n3. Mix on medium-high until fluffy and pale (10 minutes).\n4. Sift and fold in cake flour in batches, ensuring each batch is fully mixed in before adding more flour. Be careful not to deflate the batter\n5. Line a baking pan with parchment. Pour in the batter and spread evenly. Drop the pan onto the prep counter a couple of times to remove air bubbles.\n6. Bake at 180\u00baC\/355\u00baF for 10-12 minutes, until lightly golden.\n7. While the sponge is baking, dust a clean tea cloth generously with powdered sugar.\n8. When the sponge is done baking, immediately invert it onto the tea towel and remove the parchment. While still hot, roll up the sponge gently (with the tea towel as if they were one) and allow to cool completely in rolled form.\n\n*Chantilly*\n\n1. Bloom the gelatin. Dust the gelatin powder into the cold water and mix well to remove any lumps. Put the gelatin dish in an ice water water bath.\n2. Whisk the whipping cream and sugar until lightly fluffy and set aside.\n3. Remove the gelatin dish from the ice bath and put it in a hot water bath and stir until it is fully liquid.\n4. Scoop 1\/3 of the whipped cream in a separate bowl. Add the gelatin and mix well until incorporated (careful not to overmix).\n5. Return the gelatin and cream to the whipped cream bowl and mix well until it reaches a thicker (but not over mixed) consistency.\n\n*Assembly*\n\n1. Once the sponge is totally cooled, unroll it gently, remove the tea towel, and set the sponge on a sheet of parchment. Spread a layer of jam, followed by a layer of whipped cream on the sponge.\n2. Gently roll into shape, taking care not to squeeze the filling out of the sides. The parchment can help guide the form, but should not be rolled into the cake.\n3. Wrap the cake in the parchment sheet, and refrigerate for 4 hours minimum and up to overnight. For longer refrigeration, cover the cake to prevent it from drying out.\n\n*Chocolate shell*\n\n1. Melt the chocolate and butter in a double boiler and add salt. Mix until liquid.\n2. Remove the chilled cake from the refrigerator and set on a grate\/rack. For neater edges, trim the sides of the cake to achieve a straight edge. Pour the chocolate onto the cake, taking care to cover the sides where it curves under.\n3. Refrigerate 1 hour before serving.",

Add a spoonful of sugar and the melted (but cooled) butter.\n5. Mix well with a spoon until you get a homogeneous mixture. If the dough is too crumbly, add 1-2 tablespoons of milk.\n6. Place the adjustable ring on the plate and try to avoid it moving as you put in the biscuit crust.\n7. Even out the biscuit crust, and press down with a spoon, being careful not to move the ring. Refrigerate.Raspberry cream:\n8. Put the raspberries (they can be frozen) in a saucepan with water and boil until it begins to thicken.\n9.

Top with the raspberry cream and level well.\n18. Over the raspberry cream, spread the cream cheese and level again.\n19. Refrigerate the cheesecake until the next day.Decorations:\n20. After 24 hours, take the cheesecake out of the fridge and run a thin-bladed knife between the cream and the ring.\n21. Take the knife full circle and carefully remove the ring.\n22. Melt 50 gr (1.75 oz) white chocolate with a tablespoon of oil in bain marie.\n23. When completely melted, use the chocolate to decorate the cheesecake.\n24. To make it even prettier, sprinkle the top with ground pistachios and decorate with fresh raspberries.",

Preheat oven to 350F (convection bake 325F). Line 2x cupcake pans with paper liners. Place an Oreo cookie on the bottom of each cupcake holder. Set aside.\n2.  In a small bowl, whisk flour and corn starch together to sift and aerate mixture. Set aside.\n3. In a large bowl or in the bowl of an electric stand mixer, combine butter, oil, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix on low speed to combine. Gradually increase speed to medium for \\~3 minutes. Mixture will look light in colour and creamy. Scrape down sides of bowl.\n4. Add eggs and vanilla extract to the mixture. Once incorporated, slowly add 1\/3 of flour mixture to the wet batter. Next, add \u00bd of buttermilk mixture. Repeat flour and buttermilk steps, finishing with addition of the flour mixture. Scrape down sides of bowl.\n5. Add chocolate cookie crumbs to the batter. Mix one final time to incorporate.\n6. Scoop 1\/4 cup of batter into each prepared cupcake liner (with an oeo at the bottom). Bake cupcakes for \\~25 mins or until toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean.\u00a0Note:\u00a0while cupcakes are baking, begin making\u00a0Swiss Meringue Buttercream!\n7. Let cool for 5 minutes in cupcake pans then move cupcakes to wire baking rack to cool completely.\n\n  \n**Cookies &amp; Cream Frosting**\n\n1. Prepare one batch of\u00a0Swiss Meringue Buttercream\u00a0(full step-by-step recipe and trouble shooting tips on the blog). A condensed recipe version is shown in steps below.\n2.  Clean bowl of your electric stand mixer. Add egg whites and sugar to the clean electric mixer bowl. Place bowl over double boiler \u2013 the bowl should not be touching the water). Whisk sugar and egg whites until the mixture is frothy and sugar has dissolved (\\~5 min). Check the temperature with a candy thermometer \u2013 when ready, the mixture will be at 160F (71C).\n3. Return egg white mixture to stand mixer. Whisk on medium-high speed. Beat until glossy, stiff, peaks form and mixture is no longer warm to the touch (\\~10 min). Once meringue has cooled, replace whisk attachment with a paddle attachment and reduce mixer speed to LOW.\n4. Begin adding butter. Continue until all butter has been added. Over the next 10-20 minutes, the mixture will turn from a smooth, loose mixture, to a curdled mixture, to one that barely pulls away from the bowl, and then ultimately to a smooth, sturdy buttercream! Continue to beat for another 3-5 min on LOW or fold by hand to remove excess air bubbles.\n5. Add 1\/2 cup of chocolate cookie crumbs to the prepared vanilla Swiss Meringue Buttercream. Scrape down sides of bowl and mix to incorporate cookie crumbs.\n6. Top each cupcake with generous amount of frosting and decorate as desired (I like to sprinkle cupcakes with extra chocolate cookie crumbs and place a piece of Oreo on top!)",

        "recipe_comment":"# Dark Chocolate Coated Nutty Buddies\n\nTime: \\~20 min\n\nMakes 12 bars, \\~250 cal per bar\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 12 Nutty Buddy wafer cookies (made by Little Debbie, 1 standard package)\n* 8 oz dark baker\u2019s chocolate\\*\\*\n* Flaky sea salt optional, for topping\n\n\\*\\* make sure you use a chocolate that will melt nicely, most chocolate chips don't melt well for coating so look for bakers chocolate bars\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Place the Little Debbie Nutty Buddy box in the freezer at least a few hours before preparing (I typically do this the night before I plan to make them). Begin with frozen bars. If the twin wrapped bars are frozen together, allow them to warm up on the counter for a few minutes, then they should be easy to separate.\n2. Prepare simmering water in the lower portion of a double boiler. Break the chocolate up into pieces and place it in the top of the double boiler. Mix frequently with a small silicon spatula until fully melted.\n3. Meanwhile, line a cookie sheet with parchment or wax paper.\n4. Remove the bars from the freezer 1 to 2 at a time and coat in a thin layer of chocolate. *My recommended technique:* Use a fork to support the underside of the bar as you dip it into the melted chocolate. Use a silicon spatula in your other hand to make sure the bar is fully coated. Lift the bar above the chocolate using the fork and allow excess chocolate to drip off, gently scraping off excess chocolate with the silicon spatula. Place the coated bar on the prepared baking sheet, then continue until all the bars are coated.\n5. Optionally \u2013 drizzle extra chocolate over the bars for a more aesthetic look. For this to work, the original chocolate coating must be set. You can place the coated bars in the fridge or freezer to set the chocolate faster (I use the freezer). Scoop up the remaining melted chocolate using a spoon or spatula and drizzle it over the top of the bars as pictured. \n6. When the chocolate is mostly set, top with flaky sea salt if desired. \n7. Serve bars at room temp, fridge temp, or frozen. Store in an airtight container at room temp or in the fridge. To store long term, freeze the bars on a wax or parchment paper lined baking sheet so they are not touching. Once frozen, transfer to a freezer safe zip bag.\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear how it went in the comments!**",

After two hours, take the cheesecake out of the oven and put it on the counter for two hours.\n14. Take off the foil; at this point you will think the it's \u201cunderdone\u201d. The middle will have the consistency of cheesecake pudding. Release the \u201clock\u201d on the springform pan and use a dinner knife to separate the cheesecake from the pan by running it around the inside edge of the pan. Then open the lock fully and lift the outer part of the pan off the base.\n15. Put it in the refrigerator at least 12 hours, 24 is better.",

        "recipe_comment":"This recipe started as an excuse to eat whipped cream for dessert, but ended up being my new favorite summer treat! Little maple almond flour tarts get baked, cooled, and then filled with the most simple and delicious whipped yogurt filling. Top it with some red raspberries and blueberries for a delicious dessert. Here's a [link to the full recipe + video](https:\/\/www.nataliecooks.com\/free-cooking-club-recipes\/whipped-yogurt-berry-tarts) instructions and notes\n\n**IngredientsFor the almond flour crust:**\n\n* 3 tbsp (42g) butter\n* 3 cups (336g) almond flour\n* \u00bc cup (80g) maple syrup\n* 1 tsp ground cinnamon\n* \u00bd tsp kosher salt\n\n**For the whipped yogurt:**\n\n* 1 cup heavy whipping cream\n* 2 cups plain whole milk Greek yogurt\n* 2-4 tbsp powdered sugar, cane sugar, or maple syrup\n* \\*\u00bd tsp vanilla extract (optional)\n\n**For the toppings:**\n\n2 cups mixed berries\n\nOther topping ideas: banana slices with crumbled up graham cracker on top, Strawberry Rhubarb Sauce, grated chocolate + crumbled graham cracker, sprinkles, etc\u2026\n\n\\*The best sugar to use for this is powdered sugar because it mixes in well and doesn\u2019t change the color like maple syrup and coconut sugar. However, they are all good options. Make it more or less sweet to match your preferences!\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350F.\n2. Line a standard muffin pan with 12 parchment muffin cups.\n3. In a medium microwavable bowl, add the butter and microwave in 15 second intervals until melted.\n4. Add the almond flour, maple syrup, cinnamon, and salt and mix to combine until a sticky crumbly dough forms.\n5. It\u2019s best to use your hands at the end to make sure everything is well mixed.Divide the mixture between the muffin cups (about 2 tablespoons per cup), then use your fingers to press it down and up the sides of the muffin cup.\n6. It\u2019s important to press the dough enough so that it goes all the way up the sides for the whipped yogurt to go into.\n7. Start by pressing the bottom and then work up the sides (watch the video!). If it\u2019s sticking to your fingers too much, dip them in water and keep molding!\n8. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the edges turn light golden. The bottoms may puff up and crack a bit - that\u2019s fine!\n9. If the cracks are big, you can press gently to try and make the dough stick together but once it firms up it will be fine.\n10. Let cool completely before adding the whipped yogurt.In a large bowl, add the whipping cream and use an electric beater to beat on high until stiff peaks form (about 2-4 minutes).\n11. Add in the yogurt, sugar, and vanilla (if using) and beat until combined and fluffy (just about 30 seconds).\n12. Taste and add more sweetener, if needed.\n13. Add a scoop of whipped yogurt into each (completely cooled) tart cup so that it fills almost to the brim.\n14. Top with berries (or whatever toppings you want) and dig in! I also like to sprinkle a bit of salt on top at the end.\n\n**Note:** It\u2019s best to make the tarts the day before so they can cool (store in an airtight container on the counter) and then make the whipped yogurt fresh and fill them when it\u2019s time to eat!Fun idea! Create a toppings station and everyone can choose what they want to put on top!",

Unroll package of phyllo dough. You might need to trim the edges to fit your pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered.\n4. Sprinkle a handful of the walnut\/cinnamon mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, and walnut mixture again, layering as you go. The final top layer should be about 6 \u2013 8 sheets deep.\n5. Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows then cut across, and then make the diagonal cuts. It helps to rinse knife and finger every couple of cuts. That keeps the knife and your fingers from sticking to the top layer.\n6. Bake for about 40-50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.\n7. Make syrup while baklava is baking. Heat 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water until sugar is melted. Add 1 1\/2 teaspoons vanilla and 1\/2 cup of honey.

It is chilled for a few hours before serving. This dessert is delicious yet easy to make.\n\nMy mom would make this for special occasions such as Christmas and Birthdays.\n\nThe mangoes bring freshness to this sweet dessert. I must admit it's my favorite Filipino dessert.\n\n[Step-by-step video instruction](https:\/\/youtu.be\/o_385-41uKA)\n\n**Ingredients**  \n\n\n* Two cups heavy cream chilled\n* Four tablespoons condensed milk\n* One pack graham crackers\n* Two pieces mangoes sliced and cubed\n* One cup milk\n\n**Recipe steps**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Pour the whipping cream into a medium-sized bowl\n2. Use a handheld electric mixer or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment\n3. Whip the cream on medium speed for about five minutes\n4. Gradually pour the condensed milk while mixing\n5. Add more until you get the desired sweetness \n6. Mix until well-combined\n7. Pour the milk into a bowl\n8. Dip each graham in the milk, then place them into a rectangle-shaped glass dish. I use a ten-inch dish for this recipe\n9. Place enough graham crackers to form the first layer at the bottom of the dish\n10. Next, evenly spread a cup of whipping cream on the top of your graham crackers\n11. Then, put a layer of diced mangoes on top of the cream\n12. Repeat by covering the mangoes with graham crackers. It's ok to cut the crackers to fit \n13. Then cover with another layer of cream and top with more mangoes\n14. Flatten the layers\n15. Add one more layer of graham and cover with cream\n16. I like to add crushed Grahams for a final touch\n17. Cover with plastic wrap\n\nNutrition  \nCalories: 3950kcal | Carbohydrates: 429g | Protein: 59g | Fat: 229g | Saturated Fat: 125g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 10g | Monounsaturated Fat: 62g | Cholesterol: 594mg | Sodium: 3015mg | Potassium: 2392mg | Fiber: 19g | Sugar: 208g | Vitamin A: 11177IU | Vitamin C: 125mg | Calcium: 1200mg | Iron: 18mg  \n\n\nYes, mango float is high in calories (and delicious).

I also used the grams measurement.\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Measure your butter and chocolate out in a big bowl, then stick it on top of a saucepan with water (also known as a bain-marie) to melt it. Then, let the mixture cool, otherwise you\u2019ll cook the egg.\n\n2. Once mixture is cool, whisk in (I used a stand-mixer, but a good old handheld metal one will be fine, you\u2019ll just end up super hench) the sugar and eggs. \n\n3. Make sure to use a sieve to sift in your salt, cocoa powder and flour. Then use a spatula to fold in the dry ingredients, don\u2019t whisk!\n\n4. Add your mixture to a lined tray (I line mine with baking powder, I don\u2019t like just greasing it) and evenly spread out the mixture you have managed not to eat.\n\n5. Bake in the oven at 180 degrees celsius (pls google the F equivalent) for about 25 minutes, after 20 I usually stick a butter knife in. You want your knife to come out with bits of crumbs and goo, but not too much. You **DONT** want the knife to be clean.\n\n6. Leave to cool (I don\u2019t have a cooling rack to I put about an inch and a half of cold water into my sink and put the tray in there so it was half submerged). \n\nThey\u2019re nice to eat warm, cold etc. Just don\u2019t store them in the fridge, otherwise they\u2019ll go hard and weird.\n\nEnjoy :)",

Put both pans on one cookie sheet and bake for 30-40 minutes. Cake is ready when a toothpick is inserted and comes out clean.\n7. Once they are done baking, cool pans for 10 minutes on a cooling rack, then take the cakes out of the pans and set them on the cooling rack to cool completely (at least 1 hour).\n8. Once the cakes are cooled, cut them into 2 layers each.\n9. Wash, hull, and halve all but 3-4 strawberries. Chop or cut the remaining strawberries and set aside to eventually decorate the top, i.e., in a pile or a design.\n\n***For the ganache:***\n\n1. Melt the chocolate, cream and butter in a bain marie, then stir in the salt.\n2. Turn off the heat. Once fully melted, set aside 225g of the ganache and chill (preferably until set, but it can be a little liquid).\n3. Put the remaining bowl with ganache back on the saucepan (without turning on the heat) until the cake is assembled. If it sets, melt it until it\u2019s liquid.\n\n***Assembly:***\n\n1. Place one cake layer, then arrange the strawberry halves horizontally flat side down around the edge of the cake.\n2. Pipe the chilled ganache in the center, filling any gaps between the strawberries.\n3. repeat with the next cake layer.\n4. Place the final layer on top.\n5. Pour the warm ganache over the top of the cake, allowing\/pushing some of the ganache so that it drips over the sides.\n6. Top with the cut\/chopped strawberries.",

        "recipe_comment":"to make these tedious yet delicious hand pie copycats, you'll need: \n\n**CRUST:** \n\n* 2 1\/2 cups flour\n* 1 tsp salt\n* 6 tbsp unsalted butter, chilled and cubed\n* 2\/3 cup vegetable shortening, chilled\n* 1\/2 cup ice water\n\n**FILLING:** \n\n* 2 cups hulled and chopped fresh strawberries\n* 8oz cream cheese, softened\n* 1 egg\n* 1\/2 tsps vanilla extract\n* 1 cup plus 3 1\/2 tbsp sugar\n* 3 tbsp cornstarch\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CRUST INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 450 F. Mix flour and salt together in a large bowl, then add the butter and shortening.\n2. Mix all of the ingredients until mixture resembles coarse sand. You can do this with your fingers, a fork, or a food processor. Whatever works!\r  \n\n3. Add ice cold water one tbsp at a time to the mixture until there is just enough moisture that the dough begins to stick to itself and forms large clumps. You don't wanna see any dry bits.\r  \n\n4. Transfer the dough onto a floured surface, and fold the dough into itself using floured hands. The dough should not be overly sticky and should come together easily. Cut the dough in half, and form two discs. Cover with plastic wrap and store in fridge for at least one hour but up to 5 days if you wanna save it for later.  \n\n\n**FILLING INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\n1. In a food processor, process strawberries with cornstarch. Add puree and 1 cup sugar to a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat until the mixture becomes thick like jam. Set aside.\n2. In medium bowl, combine together egg, vanilla, cream cheese and 3 \u00bd tbsp of sugar with a hand mixer until light and fluffy. Set aside. If it looks a lil clumpy, that's okay!\r  \n\n\n**ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\n1. Roll pie dough out flat onto a floured surface and cut out rectangle shapes until there is no dough left, making sure to cut an even numbered amount so you have enough top and bottom layers to complete the hand pies.\n2. To the bottom layers of the pies, spoon some of each filling mixture down the center of the pie, making sure to stay clear of the edges so the pie doesn\u2019t overflow.\n3. Place the top layer of dough on top of the filled bottom layer, and press the edges together with your fingers to seal the pie. Cut a slit down the center of the hand pie.\r  \n\n4. Brush each pie with egg wash and place in the oven for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.\r  \n\n5. Enjoy!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Recipe video here, if you'd like to support our channel :)](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=g-pnjpcqRek&amp;t=37s)",

        "recipe_comment":"**Salted Butter Chocolate Chunk Shortbread Cookies** by Alison Roman\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (2\u00bc sticks) cold salted butter, cut into \u00bd-inch pieces\n* \u00bd cup granulated sugar\n* \u00bc cup (packed) light brown sugar\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 2\u00bc cups all-purpose flour\n* 6 ounces semisweet or bittersweet dark chocolate, chopped (but not too fine, you want chunks, not thin shards of chocolate)\n* 1 large egg, beaten to blend\n* Demerara sugar (for rolling)\n* Flaky sea salt\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Line a rimmed baking sheet (two, if you\u2019ve got \u2019em) with parchment paper.\n2. Using an electric mixer and a medium bowl or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, both sugars, and vanilla on medium-high till it\u2019s super light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Using a spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl and, with the mixer on low, slowly add the flour, followed by the chocolate chunks, and beat just to blend.\n3. Divide the dough in half, placing each half on a large piece of plastic wrap. Fold the plastic over so that it covers the dough to protect your hands from getting all sticky. Using your hands (just like you\u2019re playing with clay), form the dough into a log shape; rolling it on the counter will help you smooth it out, but don\u2019t worry about getting it totally perfect. You can also do this using parchment paper, if you prefer, but I find using plastic wrap easier when it comes to shaping the log. Each half should form two logs 2 to 2\u00bc inches in diameter. Chill until totally firm, about 2 hours.\n4. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F.\n5. Brush the outside of the logs with the beaten egg and roll them in the Demerara sugar (this is for those really delicious crispy edges).\n6. Slice each log into \u00bd-inch-thick rounds, place them on the pre-pared baking sheet(s) about 1 inch apart (they won\u2019t spread much), and sprinkle with flaky salt. Bake until the edges are just beginning to brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly before eating them all.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The cookie dough can be made ahead and stored, tightly wrapped in plastic, up to 1 week in the refrigerator, or 1 month in the freezer.\n* Cookies can be baked and stored in plastic wrap or an airtight container for 5 days.\n* I recommend Maldon flake salt.",

Melt the sugar over a medium heat in an oven safe until it begins to caramelize. Don\u2019t stir it but give the pan a shake every once in a while.\n2. When the sugar has melted, turn off the heat and add the butter. Use a wooden spoon to mix in but be careful, the mixture will be VERY hot.\n3. When the butter and sugar is combined, add the fruit cut side down and leave to cool for about 20 minutes.\n4. Meanwhile, roll out the pastry slightly and cut around a dinnerplate that\u2019s a similar size to the pan and gently lay the pastry over the plums, tucking the edges under with a blunt knife. \n5. Give the pastry a few pricks and bake in the oven at 200C for 25-30 minutes until golden brown.\n6. Remove from the oven, allow to cool for a couple of minutes and then loosen the edges before flipping onto a plate. \n7. Serve with cream and enjoy.\n\n\r  \n**Tips**\n\n* Can be made with apples or apricots. \n* Eat warm but the topping will set as it cools so if it\u2019s too damp when turned you might want to leave for a little while.",

        "recipe_comment":"Creme Brulee, also known as burnt cream, is a French dessert consisting of a tasty vanilla custard base, topped with a layer of hardened, caramelized sugar.\n\nIf you have a sweet tooth and never had Creme Brulee before, I bet that you will love it! \n\n*INGREDIENTS*\r\n\n*  heavy cream \\[2 cups \/ 450 ml\\]\n* 5 fresh eggs\n* 1 vanilla pod (alternatively, 1tsp vanilla extract)\n* fine caster sugar \\[1.9 oz \/ 50 g\\]\n* raw cane sugar \\[a few tsp\\]\n\n*METHOD*\n\n1. Pre-heating the oven to 160Celsius or 320Fahrenheit\n2. Pour the heavy cream into a saucepan. Cut the vanilla pod along the long side, scrape the little vanilla beans out, transfer into the saucepan and stir. Add the remaining vanilla pod in there, too\n3. Separate the egg white from the yolk, place the yolk into a bowl and the egg white into a storage vehicle of your choice for your personal use later\n4. Drop the caster sugar into the bowl, grab a whisk and combine well\n5. Grab the saucepan and, over medium-heat, bring to a slight boil, till small bubbles arise. Stir frequently and don\u2019t scorch the cream\n6. Start tampering the egg yolks: pour a small batch of the hot cream into the bowl holding the yolk and whisk immediately till fully incorporated NOTE: Don\u2019t rush it! Or you run the risk of ending up with scrambled eggs here. We did it in eight batches and took a 2-3 minutes of time for it\n7. Run the cream-yolk-vanilla mix (custard) through a mesh sieve in order to filter out the vanilla pod. Use a plastic spatula and make sure not to leave any valuable vanilla beans behind. Grab a spoon and discard the foamy layer on top of the cream\n8. Place ramekins into an oven-safe form and distribute custard cream evenly. It should almost fully fill up two ramekins of around 12cm (5inch) in diameter and around 2cm (a bit short of 1inch) in height\r\n9. Bring some water to a boil and pour it into the oven-safe dish that holds the ramekins. Cover half of ramekins in hot water.\r \n10. Transfer into the middle of the oven and place a baking sheet one layer above \u2013 it will protect the top of the custard base from burning\/hardening. The custard shall cook for 25-35 minutes, till its core temperature reaches 80 degrees C or 175 F. It will not fully firm up, but rather remain jiggly in the center\n11. Remove from the oven and take ramekins out of hot water. Let cool down a bit and transfer into the fridge, where the custard shall set and chill for at least 6 hours, better overnight\r\n12. An hour before you want to serve, take custard base out of the fridge, evenly spread 1-2 teaspoons of raw cane sugar on top and patiently and gently burn it with a kitchen torch, till the sugar caramelizes\r\n13. Transfer into the fridge for 45-60 more minutes and let melted sugar harden before serving \u2013 plain or with fruit\r\n\n**I am on a path to recreating delicious dishes from all over the world at home: join me at** r\/UnitedCuisines",

You won\u2019t believe how easy it is to make this cookie dough!  \nvideo recipe [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/yO2uAJSlwoM)  \n**INGREDIENTS**  \n\\* 2 cups All-purpose flour  \n\\* 1 cup Cake flour  \n\\* 1\/2 cup Granulated sugar  \n\\* 1 cup Brown sugar  \n\\* 1 Cup butter (2 sticks)  \n\\* 1 cup mini chocolate chips  \n\\* 3\/4 Cup milk, plus more as needed  \n\\* 2 tsp vanilla extract  \n**INSTRUCTIONS**  \nPreparing the flour  \n1. Add all of the flour to a pan and turn the pan on medium high heat. Using a whisk, start mixing and shaking the pan ever so often.  \n2. Continue to roast until the flour is heated through and has darkened ever so slightly. The flour is ready when it smells similar to popcorn and doesn't appear dusty anymore - it should develop some texture. About 12-15 minutes.  \n3. Once done, immediately move the pan off the heat. Mix every 2-3 minutes to prevent any residual heat from burning the flour.  \nMaking the cookie dough  \n1. Soften the butter by microwaving for 20-30 seconds on high. In a large bowl, add in the sugars and butter. Start your stand mixer with the paddle attachment and run on medium speed. It will take about 30 seconds to a minute. You can also use a hand mixer.  \n2. When you have a smooth texture like peanut butter, add the 1\/2 of the milk and all of the vanilla and mix again. Mix until the dough looks nice and fluffy and the colour is much paler. It will take about 30 seconds to 2 minutes.  \n3. Start adding in the flour, little bit at a time while you continue to mix on low speed. Continue to mix until you have added all of the flour and the dough has come together. If the dough appears crumbly or dry, add more milk, 1 Tbsp at a time.  \n4. Once the dough has come together, stop the mixer and add in the chocolate chips. Continue mixing until they are well combined. The dough should be soft and smooth - add more milk as required to achieve this texture.  \n5. Transfer to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 20 minutes. Scoop the cookie dough and enjoy!  \nNotes: Don't leave the pan unsupervised at any point, the flour will burn and turn the cookie dough bitter.",

Then, add the eggs and vanilla to combine.\n* Using a wooden spoon, spatula, or stand mixer, mix in the dry ingredients to form a dough. Divide the dough in half and pat it out into discs and wrap them in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least two hours or up to one day.\n\n**Filling**\n\n* Make the graham cracker crust by melting the butter and using a fork to mix in the graham crumbs and the sugar. Set aside.\n* Beat the sugar, egg, cream cheese, and vanilla until well blended. Set aside in refrigerator so it becomes more solid.\n\n**Bake**\n\n* Preheat the oven to 350F or 175C and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\n* Dust some flour on your workspace and roll out one disc of dough at a time until it's between 1\/3 and 1\/2-centimeter thick. Add more flour as necessary to prevent sticking.\n* Cut out 3\u201d or 7.5cm circles (I use the rim of my whiskey glass), re-rolling scraps as needed. Brush the edges with egg wash. Scoop 1 teaspoon of graham cracker crust and pack it into your spoon. This will help it stick together. Then plop it in the center of your hamantaschen and flatten slightly with the back of your teaspoon. Top that with 1\/2 teaspoon of cream cheese. At this point, you can optionally add your cherry on top or save it for the end. If adding it now, be sure to press it slightly into the center. It might fall to the side while baking if it's left gently on top.\n* Fold the edges up to form a triangle shape, pinching the corners firmly to seal. Then brush the edges with egg wash.\n* Place on the baking sheets, 1 inch or 2.5 centimeters apart. Bake until the dough is lightly browned, about 17 minutes.\n* If you haven't already, top each hamantaschen with a canned cherry and press it gently into the center of the cream cheese. Let cool for about five minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. After another five minutes, you can dive in!",

        "recipe_comment":"**Original Recipe:** [**Vegan Lemon Cake**](https:\/\/howtobakevegan.com\/vegan-lemon-cake\/)\n\nEnjoy this light and fluffy vegan lemon cake with dairy-free lemon frosting for a sweet and tangy treat.\n\nPrep Time: 1 hr\n\nCook Time: 40 mins\n\nResting\/Cooling Time: 2 hrs\n\nTotal Time: 3 hrs 40 mins\n\nServings: 12\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Dry ingredients for the cake:**\n\n* 1 \u00be cups all-purpose flour\n* 1 \u00be cups cake flour\n* 1 \u00bd cups granulated sugar\n* 1 tbsp baking soda\n* \u00bd tsp salt\n\n**Wet ingredients for the cake:**\n\n* \u00bd cup soy milk, or other plant-based milk\n* \u2154 cup lemon juice, or juice of 4 lemons\n* \u00bc cup apple cider vinegar\n* \u00bd cup plus 2 tbsp oil\n* 2 tbsp vanilla\n* 3 tbsp packed grated lemon zest, from about 3 lemons\n\n**Vegan Lemon Buttercream Frosting:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* 2 cups vegan butter or margarine, (stick not spreadable in a tub)\n* 8 cups confectioner\u2019s sugar, sifted\n* 1 tbsp vanilla\n* \u00bc cup fresh lemon juice, from about 2 lemons\n* 1 tbsp bottled lemon juice, or 1 - 2 tsp lemon extract\n* 2 tbsp packed grated lemon zest, from about 2 lemons\n* 8 to 14 drops Lemon Yellow food colouring\n\n**To Decorate:**\n\n* Dried Lemon Slices\n\n**Instructions**\n\n**Cake:**\n\n1. Line three 6-inch cake pans with parchment. I recommend using cake strips for a more moist, even bake. Soak in water until ready for use. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F\/180\u00b0C.\n2. Add the sugar to a large bowl of a stand mixer, then sift in the remaining dry ingredients.\n3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the liquid ingredients including the zest until fully combined.\n4. Add the bowl of dry ingredients to the stand mixer and while mixing on low, gradually pour in the wet ingredients.\n5. Mix for about 30 seconds or until most of the flour is just moistened and the batter is smooth with a few tiny lumps.\n6. Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a large spoon or silicone spatula to mix in any dry flour. Don\u2019t overmix.\n7. Evenly distribute the batter between the cake pans. If using cake strips, squeeze out excess water, wrap around each pan and secure.\n8. Place the pans in the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes with cake strips or about 20 to 25 minutes without. A skewer or toothpick inserted should come out clean.\n9. Fully cool the cakes in the pans before removing them.\n\n**Lemon Buttercream Frosting:**\n\n1. Add the vegan butter and confectioners\u2019 sugar to the stand mixer bowl.\n2. Add the bowl to the stand mixer and mix on low while gradually adding the lemon juice and vanilla.\n3. When smooth and creamy, remove about \u00bc cup of the frosting and set aside. Add the lemon zest and lemon extract to the remainder.\n4. Add enough food colouring to get your desired shade of yellow. The colour may darken as the frosting dries.\n\n**To Assemble:**\n\n1. Filling a piping bag, or zip-top bag with the corner snipped, with yellow frosting.\n2. Dab a bit of frosting on a cake board, stand or plate. Place the first cake layer on the board.\n3. Pipe a swirl of frosting on top, without gaps. Spread evenly then add the second cake layer.\n4. Add another swirl of frosting, then the final layer, bottom side up.\n5. Spread the top and sides with a thin layer of frosting to crumb coat. Place in the fridge for one hour or until the frosting is chilled.\n6. Spread the sides and top with the remaining yellow frosting and smooth.\n7. Dab some of the reserved white frosting at random spots on the cake. Smooth to add white streaks.\n8. Place the dried lemon slices on the cake and add dots of the remaining white frosting with a #2 piping tip.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* Warm lemons for about 20 seconds in the microwave, before cutting, for easier juicing.\n* Scrape the mixer beater as long strands of zest may stick to it.\n* Bottled lemon juice usually has citric acid added which can help add extra tartness and lemony flavour.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.

The crunchy turbinado sugar topping.\n\nPrep Time: 20 minutes\n\nBaking Time: 50 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 1 hour 10 minutes \n\nServings: 8 \n\nCalories: 255kcal\n\n### Equipment\n\n* 1 9\" Round Cake Pan\n* Parchment paper if needed\n* Hand mixer\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 2 medium apples such as Pink Lady, Fuji, SugarBee, or Gala\n* \u00bd cup unsalted butter room temperature\n* \u2154 cup granulated sugar\n* 3 eggs\n* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n* 2 teaspoons lemon juice\n* 2 tablespoons whole milk\n* \u00bc teaspoon salt\n* 2 teaspoons baking powder\n* 1\u00bd cups cake flour or use all-purpose flour\n* 2-3 tablespoons turbinado sugar\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Preheat oven to 350\u00baF.\n\n#### Prepare the baking dish:\n\n* If using, line the dish with parchment paper and grease the sides of the dish. If not using parchment paper, grease the entire baking dish and set aside.\n\n#### Prepare the apples:\n\n* Core the apples and quarter them. Place each quarter, cut side down, on the cutting board. Slice each quarter into 1\/8'' slices. Keep each sliced apple quarter intact so you can easily place them right on top of the cake when ready (refer to the photo).\n\n#### Prepare the cake batter:\n\n* Place the butter in a mixing bowl and use a hand mixer to mix for 1 minute until fluffy. Add the sugar and mix for 2\u20133 minutes until fully incorporated.\n* Add the eggs one at a time and mix after each addition until fully incorporated.\n* Add the vanilla extract, lemon juice, salt, and baking powder and mix again. Add the milk and mix once more until incorporated. It's okay if the mixture appears to be lumpy or curdled.\n* Add the cake flour and mix until just incorporated. Do not overmix the batter!\n\n#### Bake the apple cake:\n\n* Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and smooth it out with a rubber spatula. Carefully pick up each sliced apple quarter (keeping the quarters intact as seen in the photo) and place all the sliced apple quarters cut-side down on top of the cake.\n* Scatter the turbinado sugar on top of the cake.\n* Transfer to the oven and bake for 45 minutes or until a toothpick pierced into the center of the cake comes out clean.\n\n#### Broil (or torch) the turbinado sugar:\n\n* Turn on the broiler. Broil the cake for 1\u20133 minutes, being careful not to burn the top, until the sugars begin to melt. Remove from the oven. Alternatively, use a blowtorch to melt the sugars.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Let the cake cool and then slice and serve with whipped cream or whipped cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.

In a medium container with a tight fitting lid combine orange zest, cranberries, and cognac - stir together. Allow mixture to sit on the counter overnight (up to 12 hours).\n2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and cover several full size baking sheets with parchment paper.\n3. In a medium-sized bowl mix together flour, baking soda, kosher salt, oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and ginger - set aside.\n4. In a stand mixer with a paddle attachment (or a large bowl if that's unavailable), add room temperature butter and both sugars - mix together until smooth and fluffy. Next, mix in the egg and vanilla until well combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and gently fold in all of the dry ingredients. The mixture will seem dry, but don't worry - the dough will hydrate during resting time.\n5. Divide the cookie dough into roughly 1.5 ounce segments using a spoon or medium cookie scoop (you can weigh them if you want but it's not necessary), roll each segment into a ball, and place the balls onto a prepared cookie sheet. Bake cookies for about 14 - 16 minutes. Finished cookies will have light brown edges with a slightly soft center. Cool directly on baking sheet.\n6. In a shallow wide dish (I used a shallow cake pan) mix confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla. Mix until icing is thick. To decorate, either gently dip the tops of the cookies into the icing or use a spoon to drizzle the icing on top of the cookies. Frosting will set in about an hour. Store in an airtight container. Cookies are best eaten within 5 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n#",

Line a strainer or a small colander with cheesecloth. Set this contraption over a deep container or bowl (so that the whey can strain out the bottom without touching the strainer). Put the sour cream into the strainer and cover tightly with plastic wrap or a plastic bag and put it in the refrigerator until it has a thick texture and some amount of whey liquid has been released(at least 24 hours but up to 2 days).\n2. Add granulated sugar, honey, unsalted butter, eggs, salt and baking soda to a medium saucepan and melt them together over medium\/low heat, whisking occasionally until sugar is completely dissolved. Don\u2019t put them over high heat to prevent boiling.\n3. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a standing mixer with the paddle attachment. Then add sifted all-purpose flour and start mixing for a few minutes on a medium speed until the dough reaches a clay consistency and doesn\u2019t stick to the bowl.\n4. Cut the dough into 15 equal pieces(77g each) and let it chill for a few hours or overnight in the fridge.\n5. Take your dough out of the fridge and let it warm up a little bit. On a well-floured surface, roll each piece out into a thin 22cm circle. You can sprinkle the top with a little flour too to keep dough from sticking to your rolling pin.\n6. Using a cake ring(you can use a lid from a saucepan) cut each dough circle to make a perfect shape. Keep the scraps for later! Place each dough circle on a parchment paper and pierce with a fork all over the surface to prevent air bubbles. Bake in the oven at 200C(392F) for 6-7 minutes until golden brown. Let them cool completely.\n7. Finally, bake the scraps separated evenly on a re-used sheet of parchment. Once the scraps are baked, cooled and firm, you can crush them with a rolling pin or pulse them in a food processor until you have fine crumbs.\n8. Beat heavy cream with powdered sugar until fluffy and stiff peaks form (1-2 min on high speed). Add strained sour cream and mix gently. You can also add vanilla extract, lemon zest or juice to your taste.\n9. Place the first cake onto a turntable and top it with 6-8 tablespoons of frosting; spread it gently and equally until its surface is completely covered. Place the next cake over the frosting layer without pressing it down. Repeat the process until all the layers have been stacked and topped with the sour cream frosting. Frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting.\n10. Dust the top and sides with your cakecrumbs, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. This cake needs time to absorb some of the cream and soften, so be patient. It\u2019s worth the wait!\n11. Place finely chopped chocolate in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 15 seconds; remove the bowl from the microwave and stir. ... - Repeat the process until most of the chocolate has melted and is smooth. At this point add yellow food coloring and mix everything thoroughly.\n12. Place the bubble wrap bubble-side up on a flat surface. Pour the chocolate on top of the bubble wrap. Spread it fairly thick: you don't want to see the shape of the bubbles beneath. Let it chill out in the fridge. Gently peel off the bubble wrap. Cut it with a cake ring 2-3cm smaller than the actual cake.\n13. Place chocolate honeycomb on top of the cake. Using a star nozzle, pipe swirls of frosting around the top of the cake. You can also fill hexagonal cells with honey.\n\n***Size:***\n\nShape - round\n\nWeight - 2,2kg\n\nHeight - 10cm\n\nDiameter - 22cm\n\n***Nutrition facts per 100g:***\n\nCalories - 341\n\nCarbs - 39\n\nFat - 18\n\nProtein - 4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cook-Shoot-Enjoy-Repeat!**",

The Otap is quite hard so hold it down while you pulse until you get super fine crumbs.\n* Turn off the processor and add in the melted butter.  Pulse again until the mixture resembles wet sand.\n* Pour mixture onto the prepared pie plate and press the crumbs down with the bottom of a water glass.\n* Fix the edges with your fingers as best as you can making sure the edges of the pie plate is covered in crumbs.\n* Note:  If you don\u2019t have a food processor, you can place the Otap in a 1 gallon zip lock bag and smash the cookies with a wooden spoon until you have fine crumbs.  Note, don\u2019t leave big chunks.  Once you have the fine crumbs add the melted butter in the ziplock bag and zip it up.  Shake until the crumbs are covered in butter and looks like wet sand.  Follow the rest of the directions.\n\n**FOR THE UBE COOKIE BUTTER FILLING**\n\n* Place the marscapone in a large bowl and mix with a wooden spoon until the lumps are gone.\n* Add in the 7oz Ube Cookie Butter and mix well again until smooth.\n* Take the pie crust out of the freezer and pour in the filling.  Smooth out top with a butter knife.\n* Dot the remaining Ube Cookie butter all over the top in random places.  Using a clean butter knife make swirls with the Ube Cookie butter  by dragging the knife down and around and side to side.\n* Place in the freezer for 3 and a half hours.Meanwhile, defrost the ready made coco whip in the refrigerator.\n* Just before serving, take the Ube Pie out of the freezer and top with the coco whip.

        "recipe_comment":"[Full recipe (and others) here.](http:\/\/fromdilltodracula.com\/recipe\/placinta-cu-mere-romanian-apple-pie-cake\/)\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n***Cake***\n\n* 8 tbsp butter (or margarine)\n* 1 cup plain Greek yogurt\n* 1\/2 cup sugar\n* 2 tsp vanilla extract\n* zest of one orange\n* juice of one orange\n* 3 1\/2 cups all-purpose flour\n* 2 tsp baking powder\n* a pinch of salt\n\n  \n***Filling***\n\n* 4 apples \n* 1\/2 cup sugar\n* 1 tbsp cinnamon\n* 3.5 tbsp butter (or margarine)\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Leave a stick of butter out on your counter for about an hour, or until it reaches room temperature.  \n(While you're waiting for the butter to soften, you can always get a head start on the recipe by working on the filling \u2014 instructions begin in step 5.)  \nIn a large bowl, combine wet ingredients: butter, Greek yogurt, sugar (not a traditional \"wet\" ingredient, but it goes here), vanilla extract, zest and juice of one orange (if using the same orange, you'll want to zest before cutting into the orange, and squeezing for its juice).\n2. In another bowl, combine dry ingredients: baking powder and salt with flour. Slowly add dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredient mixture, kneading until dough is combined and elastic when stretched out. The dough will knead a little love to work the dry ingredients through it. Oh, that pun was very much intended.  \nDough too dry? Add a splash of water. Too wet and sticky? A little more flour should do the trick.\n3. Divide dough into two equal parts and form into a ball. Wrap both with plastic wrap and move to the refrigerator, chilling for at least 30 minutes.\n4. While dough is chilling (or if you're waiting for your butter to soften) wash and then grate apples using the coarse edge of your grater (the side with the large holes).  \nI prefer to leave the skin on\u2014it contains most of the apple's nutrients, after all\u2014but if that's not your jam, feel free to peel the apple before you grate it.\n5. Using a tea towel or paper towel, squeeze as much liquid as you can from the grated apples.  \nMy preferred method is putting the grated apple in a strainer, covered with a doubled-up paper towel, and then pressing the liquid out with the weight of a couple bowls resting on top of the paper towel. You can leave the apples to drain while you work on other parts of this recipe.  \nYou won't believe how much liquid comes out of these apples!\n6. In a large bowl, combine grated apples with the cinnamon and sugar. Stir until well-combined.\n7. Heat 3.5 tbsp butter (or margarine) in a saucepan. Add grated apple, cinnamon and sugar mixture to the pan, and cook until tender, approximately ten minutes. The mixture will look and smell like the caramel on a caramel apple. No judgement if you taste a bit of this step, just make sure it cools off, first!\n8. Set aside mixture, and let cool. I return it to the same bowl I used to create the grated apple, cinnamon and sugar mixture, minimizing how many bowls I use.\n9. When you remove the dough from the refrigerator, begin by pre-heating the oven to 350\u00b0F.\n10. Grease or butter a 9x9\" cooking dish or baking tray. Stretch out one ball of dough so it's pressed into the bottom of the dish, covering the dish from edge to edge. Using a fork, prick it all over. Cook for 30 minutes.  \n**Note**: If you have two dishes of the same size, that will fit side-by-side in your oven, you can cook both pieces of dough at the same time. If not, I like to leave the second ball of dough in the fridge. It won't hurt the dough by staying in longer.\n11. Allow to cool on a cooling rack while repeating step 11 with the other ball of dough.  \nSpread cooled apple mixture evenly over the bottom piece of cake while the top piece is cooking.\n12. Once the top piece of cake is cooked, allow it to cool and then place on top of the apple mixture that's already spread over the bottom piece.\n13. The traditional Romanian topping is dusted with powdered sugar, but can you imagine the variations you can try? Drizzled homemade caramel with crushed walnuts, a cinnamon and sugar crumble, a layer of thin-sliced apples . . . the options are endless!   \n\n14. If you do choose to go the traditional route, the best way to do so is with a flour sifter.  \nCut into squares (the size of your choosing) and se bucura\/enjoy!",

Start by greasing your baking pan, properly line it with parchment paper and set aside. Pre-heat oven to 350\u00b0F \/ 180\u00b0C\n2. To make the batter for the sponge cake, grab an electric mixer and a big bowl, crush the eggs and add the fine sugar. Begin whisking and beat the mass for a few minutes, till it drastically increases in size by almost 200%. Once the color desaturates and the batter turns less runny and starts to stick to your whisk, you can stop\n3. Begin to gently incorporate the all purpose flour and baking powder, which you put into a mesh strainer and sift 1\/4th of it over the batter. Gently fold it into the batter with a wooden spoon or spatula. Repeat the step 3 times with the remaining flour\n4. Melt 2 tbsp of butter and fold it into the batter, as well as a teaspoon of vanilla extact, if you like\n5. Transfer the batter into your lined baking pan and spread it all over, before giving it 1, 2, max 3 good tappy taps, in order to bring big bubbles to the surface. Don't overdo it, though! Remember, we created those many small bubbles on purpose, in order to get a spongy cake\n6. Place in the middle of your pre-heated oven and bake for 15-25 minutes, depending on the oven and what sort of pan, glass or metal, you use\n7. In parallel, take a medium-size bowl and combine the sifted icing sugar and sifted cocao powder\n8. Pour the milk into your saucepan, add the butter and heat up together, till butter is melted and milk hot. Add it to the bowl and mix well, till sugar and cacao are dissolved. Let rest till completely cooled down\n9. Get the cake out of the oven once done and place it on a cooling reck. Remove the parchment paper, and let cool down completely\n10. Depending on your baking pan, the cake might end up with uneven edges, which you shall level, before cutting the whole cake in into beautiful squares of around 2 inch \/ 5 cm. You should end up with 20 pieces\n11. Get two bowls ready, distribute 1\/3 of the cacao-sauce in one and 1\/3 desiccated coconuts in the other. Coat the sponge cakes well in the cacao sauce first, preferably use forks, elevate and let drain for a few seconds over the sauce-bowl, before dropping them into the coconuts. Use a spoon or your hands to fully cover the cakes in white coconuts flakes and transfer them on a rack to rest\n12. Enjoy!\n\n**Folks, I embarked on a mission to cook food from around the globe: join me at** r\/UnitedCuisines\n\nEDIT: You can also slice the sponge cubes and put some of your favorite jam in between, before coating. We used cherry jam and liked it very much!",

        "recipe_comment":"With how insanely overdone \"pumpkin spice\" is around this time, I figured: \"Hey, why not one more?\" so I made this delicious upgrade to cinnamon rolls! You can use canned pumpkin or fresh pumpkin puree, your own pumpkin spice, or a mix and you can include or exclude whatever you want from the icing!\n\nYield: 12 Rolls\n\nIf you'd like to see any part of this process, I've made a video, divided by chapters and you can click [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/COqDYsxOpHw) to go directly to it.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nDough:\n\n* 350g all-purpose flour\n* 200g pumpkin puree\n* 60g warm water\n* 60g warm 2% milk\n* 3 tbsp butter\n* 2 1\/4 tsp (1 pkg) dry active yeast\n* 1\/4 cup brown sugar\n* 1\/2 tsp salt\n\nPumpkin Pie Spice:\n\n* 1\/2 tsp cloves\n* 1 tsp allspice\n* 3\/4 tsp nutmeg\n* 1\/2 tsp ginger\n* 1 tbsp cinnamon\n\nFilling:\n\n* 1\/4 cup margarine (or butter, but I always forget to leave extra out)\n* 1\/2 cup brown sugar\n* 1 recipe \\^\\^\\^ of pumpkin pie spice (roughly 2 tbsp)\n\nMaple Cardamom Icing:\n\n* 4 oz. warm cream cheese\n* 1\/4 cup 2% milk\n* 60g maple syrup\n* 1\/4 tsp cardamom seed, ground\n* 2 tbsp icing sugar\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. Mix together water, milk, yeast and 1 tbsp brown sugar.\n2. When yeast is nice and foamy, add in all remaining dough ingredients except for 175g (or half) of flour and use a wooden spoon or paddle attachment to mix until combined.\n3. Add remaining flour and knead in stand mixer on medium-high for about 5-6 minutes.\n4. When dough is smooth and elastic, set aside in greased bowl to rise until doubled in size, approximately 1 hour.\n5. While the dough is resting, you can make the spice mixture and icing by just combining the ingredients listed.\n6. When dough has doubled in size, flour the top lightly, press out majority of the gas, and flip out onto a generously floured table.\n7. Roll dough into a rectangle roughly 1\/8 inch thick. You can either flour the top of the dough lightly or a rolling pin for this. I floured my dough.\n8. Brush rolled out dough with 1\/4 cup of margarine or soft butter, (I used margarine because my memory is similar to that of a goldfish and it's spreadable straight from the fridge) then evenly spread brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice overtop of the margarine.\n9. Starting with one of the long sides, gently roll the dough up tightly, trying to avoid large gaps or air bubbles that may make the rolls fall apart.\n10. Cut the resulting log into 12 equal pieces and set them cut sides down in a 9 inch oven-safe pan, covered, for 45 minutes to proof.\n11. Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 20-25 minutes, until nicely browned and cooked through.\n12. Top with icing if desired.",

        "recipe_comment":"Nanaimo Bars are said to revive sweet childhood memories among many Canadians and is sometimes referred to as \"Canada's Favorite Confection\". It's a NO-BAKE dessert, consisting of three well balanced layers of nuts, sweet custard icing and chocolate.\n\nI used the official Nanaimo Bar recipe published on the website of Nanaimo city by Joyce Hardcastle with slight adjustments and highly suggest that you give it a try with your next mug of coffee or tea. Enjoy!\n\n**Enjoy the recipe and** [**United Cuisines on YouTube!**](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7Vjy2saPEmU)\n\n*INGREDIENTS FOR 12-16 BARS*\n\nBase layer:\n\n\\- Graham wafer crumbs or, alternatively, digestive biscuits \\[1.75 cups \/ 180 g\\]\n\n\\- coconut flakes \\[1 cup \/ 75 g\\]\n\n\\- finely chopped almonds \\[1\/2 cup \/ 50 g\\]\n\n\\- unsalted butter \\[1\/2 cup \/ 110 g\\]\n\n\\- fine\/caster sugar \\[1\/4 cup \/ 45 g\\]\n\n\\- cocoa powder \\[5 tbsp \/ 30 g\\]\n\n\\- 1 fresh egg\n\nCustard icing layer:\n\n\\- unsalted butter \\[1\/2 cup \/ 110 g\\]\n\n\\- heavy cream \\[3 tbsp \/ 50 ml\\]\n\n\\- Bird's custard powder \\[2 tbsp \/ 25 g\\]\n\n\\- icing sugar \\[2 cups \/ 200 g\\]\n\nCoating:\n\n\\- unsalted butter \\[2 tbsp \/ 30 g\\]\n\n\\- semi-sweet chocolate \\[4 oz \/ 120 g\\]\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. For the 1st layer: Pulverize crackers, if you can't find Graham wafer crumbs, and - in a big enough bowl - mix those with the finely shredded coconut flakes as well as almonds and set aside\n2. Melt butter in a double boiler (\"bain-marie\"). Whisk in sugar and cacao till well combined, before adding a beaten egg.  When adding the egg, make sure that you're simultaneously whisking the mass, in order for the egg to be incorporated fast. Otherwise you'll end up with junks of scrambled eggs. Continue whisking for a few minutes, till all ingredients unite and the mass thickens\n3. Combine ingredients from steps 1 &amp; 2 and distribute over your 8x8 inch \/ 20x20 cm form. Evenly spread and press it with your spatula to a firm mass, leaving no space in between\n4. For the 2nd layer: In a clean bowl, drop the warm butter, and unite it with the cream, custard powder and icing sugar. Once you get an even mass, you gotta grab your whisk and fluff it up! This took me 10-15 minutes, but if you have a proper electric whisk, you'll get there sooner \n5. Now spread that custard icing over the 1st layer of almond-coco-cracker\n6. For the 3rd layer, combine the butter an chocolate in the double boiler till fully emulsified, which shouldn't take too long\n7. Before pouring it over the 2nd layer, let cool down a bit, till not hot anymore, but still liquid. Evenly spread the chocolate, but be very careful and don't press it into the custard layer. I elevated the form and changed the angle and let the chocolate run all over. It worked out alright\n8. Cover the form with plastic wrap and let chill in your fridge for at least 3 hours, before serving! I noticed that it tasted better, when kept in fridge overnight\n9. Enjoy!\n\n**Folks, I embarked on a mission to home-cook dishes from around the world: join me!**",

However pectin makes the it really easy to make any sort of jams, so i highly recommend to buy it from the store.\n\n\r  \n\\- You can make dehydrated\/candied Orange slices by placing slices into the oven for around 2-4 hours at around 100\u00b0C. Lovely for decoration.\n\n\r  \n\\- You can definitely use a normal baking pan for this recipe. However, the perforated ring helps to make it look super professional.

Sift in Cake Flour and mix until barely just combined\n\n\/5. Knead it by scrapping the dough against a rolling mat, until fully homogenous\n\n\/6. Place it between two sheets of parchment and roll to about \\~3mm thickness\n\n\/7. Place in the fridge minimum 2 hours (better overnight)\n\n\/8. Get your perforated ring mold and grease it fully\n\n\/9. Cut the dough with the ring (it will stick to the bottom of the ring, move quickly though since it melts very fast) and place it on a silicon baking mat\n\n\/10. Cut strips according to the circumference of the ring and quickly place it in the edges of the ring, connecting any broken\/short pieces with more strips (glue it with your hand, the heat will help combine two strips together)\n\n\/11. Freeze for 20 min until rock hard\n\n\/12. Bake at 170C for 15-20 minutes (check for colour)\n\n\/13. Wait for it to cool and take it out of the ring\n\n. \r\n\nAlmond Cream:\r  \n\\- Butter 56g\r  \n\\- Powdered Sugar 56g\r  \n\\- Almond Powder \/ Meal 56g\r  \n\\- Eggs 50g\r  \n\\- Rum Essence 1 tsp\n\n\r  \n\/1.

Brush Egg Wash (1 part Egg Yolk and 4 parts Cream) all over the tart crust\n\n\/2. Fill the crust with Almond Cream until 70% of the way \n\n\/3. Bake 160C for 10-14 minutes \n\n\/4. Let it cool and fill the gaps with the orange jam.\n\n\/5 Decorate as you wish but my preference is to used canned orange slices (the ones doused in syrup) after draining it.\n\n\u200b\n\nENJOY",

Set aside extra egg mixture. \n\nDust contour with flour and flatten dough using hands into a rectangle about 2.5cm\/1in thick and 6cm\/2.5in wide. \n\nFor American-style scones, cut the dough in quarters, and then on a reverse diagonal, cut into eights. Pick up each one, and quickly dust each side so scone is completely dusted. \n\nPut scones on baking sheet spaced at least 2.5cm\/1in apart, as thy will spread when baked. Quickly brush the scones with the remaining egg mixture. \n\nBake 14-20 minutes in the preheated open until rise and golden. Dust with powdered monk fruit sweetener with a sifter or eat as is or with butter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think they turned out good. Tho, I would put less dates in it if I make date scones again.

        "recipe_comment":"Bakewell Tarts aren't traditionally made with blackcurrant jam, but we found it works *so* well because the jam has such a zing to it. Obviously the pastry could be shop-bought to simplify things if wanted!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients**\r  \n\r*For the pastry:*\r  \n\r\\- 300g plain white flour\r  \n\\- 30g white sugar\r  \n\\- 1\/2 teaspoon fine salt\r  \n\\- 200g cold unsalted butter\r  \n\\- 1 egg yolk\r  \n\\- 3 tablespoons cold water (the colder, the better)\r  \n\n\n*For the filling:*\r  \n\r\\- 1 jar blissfully blackcurrant jam\r  \n\\- 130g ground almonds\r  \n\\- 30g plain white flour\r  \n\\- 100g caster sugar\r  \n\\- 110g unsalted butter at room temperature\r  \n\\- 2 eggs\r  \n\\- 1 teaspoon almond extract\r  \n \r  \n\r  \n**Method**\r  \n\r  \n1. For the pastry, start by adding the flour, sugar and salt to a food processor. Cut the cold butter (it needs to be cold and firm) into medium cubes (approximately 1x1 inch) and distrbute the cubes on top of the dry ingredients. Pulse 16 times.\r  \n\r  \n2. Turn off the food processor, add the egg yolk and turn it back on its lowest setting. While it is running, add 2-3 tablespoons of water and process for up to 10 seconds, just enough to combine. The pastry should still be quite crumbly after these steps.\r  \n\r  \n3. Turn the pastry onto a flat clean surface and, working it as little as possible, form it into a ball. Cover it tightly and put it in the fridge for 1 hour.\r  \n\r  \n4. Pre-heat the oven to 180C\/160C Fan. Once the pastry has cooled, dust a flat surface with flour and roll out the dough medium-thin, or to the thickness of your liking, into a circle. Roll it up in a rolling pin and unfold it on a tart case. Use excess trimmings to fill up any gaps or holes (tip: use a small piece of dough as a tool to press the pastry against the case, ensuring it is well fit). Leave the overhangings for now, i.e. do not trim the edges, but do save a bit of dough in case you need to fill any holes later. \r  \n\r  \n5. Using a fork, make several holes throughout the bottom of the pastry. Place a piece of greaseproof baking paper on top of the tart case and top it with baking beans, rice or any other grain to weigh it down. Bake for 15-20mins.\r  \n\r  \n6. Remove the case from the oven, remove the baking paper and beans and bake it for another 5 minutes. Remove it from the oven and, while the pastry is still hot, use a serrated knife to carefully go around the edges of the case and trim them. Leave your knife as flat as possible for a smooth cut. Trimming the pastry at this stage rather than earlier reduces shrinkage.\r  \n\r  \n7. Set the pastry aside. For the filling, beat together the butter and sugar using an electric mixer for approximately 5 minutes, until light and fluffy.\r  \n\r  \n8. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well in between, and finally add the almond extract, beating once again to incorporate.\r  \n\r  \n9. Delicately fold in the ground almonds and flour, just until combined. Do not overmix or use an electric mixer for this stage.\r  \n\r  \n10. Line the tart case with a full jar of Blissfully Blackcurrant Jam, and delicately add the frangipane filling on top, using the back of a spoon to carefully spread it throughout the tart.\r  \n\r  \n11. Bake for 35-40mins until the frangipane has set. Let the tart cool fully before removing it from the case. Serve with creme fraiche, and be happy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Blog Post:** [**https:\/\/pantree.co\/recipes\/post\/blackcurrant-bakewell-tart.html**](https:\/\/pantree.co\/recipes\/post\/blackcurrant-bakewell-tart.html)",

        "recipe_comment":"The combination of these two delicious desserts is sinful and sexy. Each spoonful asks for another and when everything is gone you look for more, addiction? Very likely!\n\nPreparation is simple but it takes a little bit of waiting for the layers to set. Everything that takes time tastes a lot better and we are here for the quality of flavour! Enjoy cooking friends!\n\n**The Biscuit Base**\n\nFor the base layer of the Tiramisu Cheesecake, you can use any type of digestive biscuits. I choose one cover with chocolate to add another layer of love to the recipe.\n\nBe very careful not to add too much butter to the base as this will solidify it too much and you will not be able to dig in. We finish this layer with a nice shot of espresso but you can try different things to your liking.\n\n**Chocolate Middle**\n\nThis layer is basically thick chocolate ganache with the liquor, you can skip alcohol completely and substitute it with almond extract or other baking aromas.\n\n**Cheesecake Topping**\n\nFor this creamy layer, I like to use full-fat Philadelphia cheese, you can opt for a lighter version and lower the amount of sugar by half but why would you do this? It is a sin worthy dessert! I always recommend vanilla bean paste over the extract but use what's in your cupboard and it will still taste superb. You can also add any type of citrus zest that you like to create another layer of freshness in this dessert.\n\n**Garnish**\n\nIf you go for simplicity and a more classical look cocoa powder is just fine. To elevate more use crushed dark chocolate or super tasty chocolate espresso beans.\n\n**Ingredients for base:**\n\n150g (5.3oz) of chocolate digestive biscuits\n\n30g (1oz) of melted butter\n\n3tsp of strong espresso\n\n**Ingredients for chocolate layer:**\n\n250g (8.8oz) of milk chocolate (drops or finely chopped)\n\n150ml of double cream\n\n100ml of coffee flavoured liquor like Tia Maria or Kahlua\n\n**Ingredients for the cheesecake layer:**\n\n150g (5.3oz) of cream cheese\n\n100ml of double cream\n\n1tsp vanilla bean paste\n\n50g (1.7oz) of icing sugar\n\ncocoa powder for garnish\n\n**Instructions:**\n\nFor this recipe, you will need 5 dessert jars or glass bowls.\n\n1. Crush chocolate digestive biscuits in a bag with a rolling pin then transfer to a bowl, combine with melted butter and 3tsp of strong espresso. With a help of a spoon transfer to glass bowls\/jars and create a flat bottom layer then place in the fridge.\n2. For the chocolate layer, place a bowl over a pan of simmering water and add the double cream, chocolate drops and liquor. Once chocolate melts, gently stir with a spatula until combined and pour into the jars. Place back in the fridge to set for 3-4h.\n\nTip: When cooking over simmering water (Bain-Marie): Make sure that the bowl doesn't touch the water, you want the steam to transfer the heat and do the cooking.\n\n3. Once the chocolate layer is set you can proceed with the cheesecake, to do so use a hand or standing mixer. Beat the cream cheese to soften up then add vanilla bean paste, icing sugar and double cream. Whisk until stiff peaks then transfer to jars. Dust with cocoa powder and place back in the fridge for a couple of hours.\n\n4. You can keep Tiramisu Cheesecake in the fridge for up to 3 days.

        "recipe_comment":"This was my first time making ice cream cake and I really loved the way it turned out. I'm already thinking about a million delicious variations that I'd like to try next time.This recipe is so flexible, just use what you have and enjoy!\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**BROWNIE LAYER**\n\n* 1 cup fine almond flour (or AP Flour)\n* 1\/4 cup cocoa powder\n* 1 tsp baking powder\n* 1\/2 tsp salt\n* 1\/3 cup melted butter (I used Miyokos Creamery Butter)\n* 2 flax eggs (or regular eggs)\n* 2\/3 cup granulated erythritol (or regular sugar)\n* 1 tsp vanilla extract\n\n**ICE CREAM LAYER**\n\n* Two Pints of your favorite chocolate and\/or vanilla ice cream (I used Halo Top)\n\n**FROSTING LAYER**\n\n* 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips  (I used Enjoy Life Vegan Chips)\n* 1\/4 cup  milk of choice ( I used cashew milk)\n* 1\/4 cup unsalted butter (I used Miyokos Creamery Butter)\n* 1 tsp vanilla extract\n* Pinch of salt\n\n**OPTIONAL TOPPINGS**\n\n* 1 cup of whipped cream\n* 3\/4 - 1 cup of crushed chocolate cream cookies\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS**\n\n1. First, make your brownie layer. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease a\u00a09 inch round springform pan and line with parchment paper. Mix all brownie ingredients well and spread evenly into the pan. Bake 15 minutes, then let cool completely.\n2. While brownie layer is cooling, allow ice cream to slightly soften out of the freezer for easier spreading. Once brownie layer is cooled add ice cream on top and spread evenly. Put pan inside freezer and allow at least 4 hours for ice cream to completely firm up before adding frosting\n3. Make frosting: In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, mix together the chocolate chips, milk, butter, vanilla extract and salt. Stir until melted and completely smooth. Allow to cool completely. Remove cake pan from freezer and evenly spread frosting over top ice cream layer.\n4. Now you may spread an even layer of whipped cream over top if you\u2019d like and evenly sprinkle crushed up cookies or any other preferred topping, allow to firm again in the freezer before slicing into cake and enjoy!\n\nIf you\u2019d like to watch me make this recipe, you can see it [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/5UTWoXOK_JE)!",

In a large bowl, mix together the steamed and grated ube along with the sugar, butter, and water until well combined  \n2. Pour the mixture onto a pan on medium-high heat and cook until the paste forms and clings to itself, away from the pan  \n3. Transfer the ube paste to a heatproof bowl and cover with plastic wrap so that the plastic wrap touches the surface of the ube paste  \n4. Refrigerate until cool  \n5. Once cooled, divide the ube paste into 12 equal-sized balls  \n\nMochi  \n1. In a microwave-safe bowl combine the glutinous rice flour, sugar, cornstarch, water, and oil until well combined  \n2. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 2 minutes  \n3. Remove from the microwave and stir the mochi around  \n4. Cover the bowl again and microwave for another 2 minutes  \n5. Remove from the microwave and stir the mochi around  \n6. Cover the bowl again and microwave for a final 30 seconds  \n7. Remove from the microwave and give it one final stir before covering with plastic wrap (so that the film touches the top of the mochi) and allow to completely cool  \n8. Once cooled, divide the mochi into 12 equal-sized balls  \n\nMooncake Pastry  \n1. For the water dough, in a large bowl combine the flour, sugar, water, and softened butter  \n2. Gently knead the dough until it forms and comes together (does not necessarily need to be smooth or pass the windowpane test at this point)  \n3. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and allow to sit for 30 minutes  \n4. For the oil dough, in a small bowl combine the flour, butter, and ube extract  \n5. Knead the dough until it forms together and then wrap it with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to sit for 20 minutes  \n6. Once both of the dough have rested, divide each of them into 6 equal-sized balls  \n7. Take a white, water dough ball and flatten it out into a circle. Fully encase this dough around the purple oil dough ball  \n8. Repeat this step for all the dough balls  \n9. Take one of the encased balls and, with the seam side down, roll out the dough into a long strip  \n10. Take the edge with the least amount of white dough and start to roll up the dough from one end to the other until you have a log  \n11. Repeat the above two steps with the rest of the dough balls  \n12. Then take the dough log, and placing it down vertically with the seam side down, roll it out into a long thin rectangle  \n13. Once again roll up the dough into a log and cut it in half  \n14. Repeat the above two steps with the rest of the dough logs  \nNote: Throughout this entire process ensure that the dough is always covered with plastic wrap once done using it!  \n\nAssembly  \n1. Preheat the oven to 340F  \n2. Take a ball of ube paste and wrap it around a cooled ball of mochi  \n3. Repeat this until you have 12 evenly sized ube mochi balls  \n4. Take a halved log of the mooncake pastry and, with the cut side down, carefully roll it out into a circle  \n5. Place the ball of ube mochi into the center and wrap the pastry around that (it's important to ensure that the previously cut side of the dough is the side that is on the outside of the mooncake once the ube mochi ball has been wrapped)  \n6. Repeat the above two steps for the rest of the ube mochi balls  \n7. Place the mooncakes on a lined baking sheet and bake for 20-22 minutes  \n8. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack before enjoying!\n\n**Recipe can also be found here!** https:\/\/butfirstboba.com\/2021\/09\/13\/ube-mochi-mooncake\/",

Moreover, for your own good, make sure to invite family and friends when making this, for Malva pudding is very delicious and super high in calories.\n\n**Enjoy the recipe and** [**our United Cuisines Show on YouTube!**](https:\/\/youtu.be\/cFiGqabtTTE)\n\nLIST OF INGREDIENTS\n\nFor the cake:\n\n\\- sugar \\[ 3\/4 cup \/ 150 g\\]\n\n\\- fresh milk \\[ 1\/2 cup \/ 120 ml\\]\n\n\\- all purpose flour \\[1 cup \/ 130 g\\]\n\n\\- warm butter \\[1 tbsp \/ 15 g\\]\n\n\\- 2 fresh eggs\n\n\\- apricot jam \\[1 tbsp \/ 15 g\\]\n\n\\- (apple sider) vinegar \\[2 tsp \/ 10 ml\\]\n\n\\- sodium bicarbonate AKA baking soda \\[1 tsp \/ 4 g\\]\n\n\\- half teaspoon of salt\n\nFor the sauce:\n\n\\- sugar \\[1\/3 cup \/ 70 g\\]\n\n\\- butter \\[3.5 oz \/ 100 g\\]\n\n\\- heavy cream \\[3\/4 cup \/ 180 ml\\]\n\n\\- vanilla essence \\[1-2 tsp \/ 5-10 ml\\]\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F\/180\u00b0C\n2. Start with the cake batter: In a big enough bowl, whisk eggs, sugar, apricot jam and warm butter till well combined\n3. Mix in the milk and vinegar (we used apple sider, but any vinegar works. It's less about the taste, but rather vinegar acting as a raising agent when combined with baking soda)\n4. Combine the flour, baking soda, as well as salt in a separate bowl and gradually sift it into the batter and whisk well\n5. Grease an oven safe form \\[approx. 8x8 inches \/ 20x20 cm\\], transfer the batter into it and spread it evenly\n6. Bake for 30-40 minutes in the middle of your oven, till fully cooked (you can perform the usual wooden toothpick test)\n7. While cooking prepare the sauce: In a saucepan, over medium heat, combine the sugar, butter, heavy cream and vanilla essence. Mix till butter is fully melted and sugar dissolved, bring to a slight boil, take off the heat, put on a lid and set aside, till cake finishes baking\n8. When the cake is done, take it out of the oven and pour the sauce over the cake. The sauce will be fully absorbed by the cake within minutes\n9. Let it rest for 10 minutes and serve it warm. Vanilla ice cream and custard go very well with it\n10.

Make the crust: Mix the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a medium bowl until combined. Evenly press crust into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.\n3. Make the filling: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute. On medium-high speed, beat in yogurt until completely combined. Then beat in the eggs and egg yolk until combined. Finally, beat in the sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla extract until everything is combined and no lumps remain.\n4. Pour filling onto the crust. Bake for 28-32 minutes or until the center of the bars no longer jiggles (remove from the oven and gently wiggle the pan to check). Allow the bars to cool at room temperature set on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill for 3-4 hours or even overnight.\n5. Once chilled, lift the foil out of the pan using the overhang on the sides and cut into squares. \n\nIf you'd like to watch me make these lemon bars, you can check that out [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/nqALvKW09xM)!",

When soft peaks form, add a shot of Bailey\u2019s and whip a few seconds longer for Bailey\u2019s whipped cream) but after I shaved down a chocolate bar, I wasn\u2019t feeling like the extra step so I used canned whipped cream. *One thing I have noticed about canned vs. fresh is that the canned stuff melts very quickly into the drink whereas fresh whipped cream will hold throughout the drink so you'll still have some left to slurp up at the end. Yum! So while I didn't follow my own advice for this picture, I do recommend taking the extra time to make your own.*  \n\n\n  \nTop with chocolate shavings and enjoy!",

        "recipe_comment":"Put on a purple jelly coat to turn it into a purple sweet potato layer cake. The purple sweet potato cake with jelly has a more charming color and a rich taste. Full of purple sweet potato fragrance, it tastes cold and refreshing, very suitable for hot summer days. You can watch the ASMR instructional video [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/CNm9ckvw-kI).\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#INGREDIENTS\n#####Cake Base\n- 4 Eggs (approximately 65 grams in shell)\n- 120g Purple Sweet Potato Mash\n- 80g Cake Flour\n- 70g Milk (20g milk powder + 50g water)\n- 50g Corn Oil\n- 40g Caster Sugar\n- A Few Lemon Juice\/White Vinegar\n- A Pinch Of Salt\n\n#####Jelly Layer (blended)\n- 100g Purple Sweet Potato\n- 200g Coconut Milk\n- 200g Water\n- 40g Corn Flour\n\n#####Jelly Layer (cooked)\n- 400g Water\n- 60g Caster Sugar\n- 10g Konnyaku Jelly Powder (a pack)\n- 2 Pandan Leaves\n\n#INSTRUCTIONS\n#####Cake Base\n1. Peel and cut purple sweet potato into small pieces. Steam on high heat for 10 minutes or until soft.\n2. Mashed the purple sweet potato used to make the cake, and let the rest cool for later use.\n3. Put baking paper on the bottom of the mold.\n4. Add enough water to the steamer to preheat.\n5. Put the egg yolk in the mashed purple sweet potato, then add corn oil, salt, and milk, and then mix well.\n6. Put the egg whites into a large bowl free of oil and water, and add lemon juice or white vinegar.\n7. After beating with a whisk at high speed until the egg whites appear coarse foam. Add fine sugar in 3 portions, and continue to beat at high speed until stiff peak.\n8. Pour in the purple sweet potato paste and continue to stir evenly with a whisk.\n9. Sift in the cake flour in 3 portions, and mix until there is no dry powder with the folding method.\n10. Pour the batter into the mold, use chopsticks to eliminate bubbles, and smooth the batter.\n11. Put it in a preheated steamer and steam for 55 minutes on medium-low heat (Leave a seam on the lid), then turn off the heat and leave for 5 minutes. \n12. Press lightly along the edge of the mold after it is out of the pot, and place it on the cooling rack to cool for at least one hour after demolding.\n13. After the cake base has cooled and stabilized, slice it into 3 or 4 slices for later use.\n\n#####Jelly Layer And Final Jelly Cake\n1. Pour purple sweet potato, corn starch, coconut milk, and water into a blender and beat until smooth and set aside.\n2. Boil a pot of hot water for later use. This is used to keep the jelly paste warm later.\n3. Mix the sugar and konnyaku powder evenly and then pour it into the dry pan.\n4. Add water and stir until there are no lumps before turning on the fire.\n5. Stir on low heat until the water boils, then slowly pour in the purple sweet potato paste, stirring while pouring. Stir until it boils and then turn off the heat. Then keep warm the cooked jelly with hot water, which can slow down the solidification speed of the jelly.\n6. Scoop 3 scoops of batter into the cake mold to spread it evenly.\n7. Put in a piece of cake and press gently. Scoop 2 to 3 spoons of jelly and spread it evenly. Repeat until the cake is finished.\n8. Let it cool for 10 minutes, then wrap it in plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.\n9. Press lightly along the edge of the mold, and then shake the mold upside down to release the mold. Cut it into the size you like.",

Wash the strawberries and cut into quarters. Remove pedicel and leaf cap except on three strawberries, which you can use for decorative purposes\n2. Whip the cream, which probably is the one and only challenge in this recipe! Cool down your whisk and bowl in the fridge, which can make difference, esp. on hot summer days. The cream must be cold, too. We not only stored it in the fridge, but put in into the freezer for 30 minutes before whipping it\n3. Perform stiffness test on your whipped cream: it should double in volume and remain in the bowl, when turned upside down shortly\n4. Mix in vanilla extract into the cream\n5. Assemble the Eton Mess by adding half of the whipped cream to the strawberries and break up the meringue into bite-size pieces and spread on top. Gently mix\/fold everything and repeat the step with remaining cream and meringue\n6. Transfer into your favorite serving vehicle and enjoy ASAP, otherwise the crunchy meringue will turn soft\n\n**Note:** We did not add any sugar, for the meringue is extremely sweet already, and our ripe strawberries were great without any additional sugar.\n\nWe embarked on a mission to bring the world a little bit closer together with the unifying power of good food: JOIN US!",

Dorayaki is a popular Japanese confectionary, and its most common variety is honey flavored castella cakes with red bean paste. \r\n\nHave you already made this type of dorayaki before?\r I also included a pretty comprehensive list of others flavors\/fillings that you can experiment with!\r\n\n[Full recipe](https:\/\/www.assortedeats.com\/homemade-dorayaki\/) with other flavors\/fillings and more info!\r\n\nIngredients\r\n\n* 4 eggs\r\n* 100 g sugar, 1\/2 cup\r\n* 63 g honey, 3 tbsp\r\n* 160 g all-purpose flour, 1 1\/3 cup\r\n* 1 tsp baking powder\r\n* 2 tbsp water\r\n* red bean paste\r\n\nInstructions\r\n\n1. In a large bowl, add the eggs, sugar, and honey. Whisk well until the sugar has dissolved. The eggs do not need to be fluffy.\r\n2. Sift the flour and baking powder into the bowl. Gently whisk the ingredients together until the batter is smooth.\r\n3. Cover and refrigerate the bowl for 15-20 minutes. Five minutes before the dorayaki pancake batter is done chilling, preheat a nonstick pan over medium-low heat.\r\n4. Take the dorayaki batter out of the refrigerator and stir in the water. You may need to add more or less water depending on your eggs and flour measurement. \r\n5. Pour in a small amount of oil into the nonstick pan and use a paper towel to spread the oil into a thin layer and wipe off excess oil.\n6. Add 2 tbsp of the batter into the pan. Cook for about 2 minutes until the bubbles start appearing and popping on the surface of the pancakes. Then, flip the pancakes over and cook for roughly one more minute. \n7. Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and cover them with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out and getting tough. Repeat with the remaining batter.\r\n8. Spread a heaping tablespoon or two of red bean paste onto one pancake, keeping the center thicker. Add another pancake on top and pinch the edge of the pancakes together to create one sandwich. Repeat with the remaining pancakes.\r\n9. Store pancakes in an airtight container for up to 2-3 days. If there are still leftover pancakes, you can wrap them individually in plastic wrap and freeze the pancakes for up to one month.",

Break up the cake, add heavy cream and melted chocolate into the cake, it will make it stick together like dough.   \n\\*\\* The ratio of the cream\/melted chocolate to the cake is not fixed. I usually add a small amount at a time and roll it together, until it feels wet like a dough, and can be easily stuck together.\n2. Melt the white chocolate, then fill the popsicle mold with it. Rotate the mold to spread the chocolate evenly, until it is covered all over the mold. Use a spatula to remove the excess chocolate.\n3. Place strawberry slices on the mold, and then insert the popsicle sticks while the chocolate is still warm. \n4. Place the mold in the freezer for 5 minutes. Once take out again, add the second layer of chocolate to make sure the mold is fully covered. Freeze for another 5 minutes.\n5. Add the cake dough in and gently press it to make sure it fills in all the gaps inside the mold.\n6. Cover more melted chocolate on the top. Use a spatula to spread the chocolate evenly and then remove the excess.\n7. Freeze for 5 minutes and it will be very easy to push the cakesicles out of the mold.  \n\\*\\* If there is chocolate cover the strawberry slices, it would be a very thin layer and can be easily removed with a folk.\n8. To decorate the cakesicles, add warm chocolate to a piping bag and fill around the edge between strawberry and chocolate. Add sprinkles on the top. The warm chocolate will work like glue and make the sprinkles stick to the cakesicle when it cools down. Enjoy!",

        "recipe_comment":"Grating tomatoes is one of the BEST ways to use up those over-ripe tomatoes. I love it because it's no-mess...you don't have to dice them or blanch them and you won't have skins in the sauce.\n\nYou just grate on the large holes of a box grater and you can whizz through a bunch of tomatoes in like 5 mins. You want to use juicy, super ripe tomatoes...avoid Roma tomatoes as they are too dry\/firm.\n\nI use this process for homemade salsa because honestly, i just hate chopping up tomatoes (I have slight eczema on my fingers and the acidity of tomatoes really effs up my fingers) so grating is a really nice way to prep them for me!\n\nJust be mindful that there's a LOT of water in the grated tomatoes so you want to cook it off. I don't like straining them because I like cooking down the liquid; I think it makes a more flavorful sauce.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1\u00bd pounds large, ripe tomatoes (or use 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes)\n* 1 pound hot Italian sausage\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 2 small zucchini, trimmed and diced\n* Crushed red pepper to taste\n* Pinch of sugar optional\n* 16 ounces rigatoni\n* 5 ounces baby spinach\n* 1 lemon, juiced\n* \u00bd cup Parmesan, finely grated; a pinch reserved for garnish\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Prep the tomatoes:**\n\n1. Cut off a very thin slice from the bottom of the tomatoes.\n2. Grate the tomatoes into a large bowl using the large holes of a box grater. Discard the skins.\n\n**Cook the sausage:**\n\n1. Heat a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the sausage and cook, breaking it up periodically, for 12\u201315 minutes until cooked through. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and drain off all but a teaspoon of the oil in the pot.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the onion. Cook for 5\u20137 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and zucchini and fry for 1\u20132 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper to taste.\n2. Return the sausage to the pot and pour in the grated tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20\u201330 minutes or until the sauce is thick. Stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from sticking. The grated tomatoes make quite a bit of excess water, so you want to cook it all off!  Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Boil the pasta:**\n\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add a generous amount of salt and the rigatoni. Cook until 1-2 minutes under al dente. Scoop out 1\/2 cup pasta water and drain the pasta.\n\n**Finish the pasta:**\n\n1. Taste the sauce and season once more. Add the baby spinach, lemon juice, and cooked pasta. Toss to coat for 2\u20133 minutes until the spinach is wilted. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and toss to coat for 1 minute more. Add pasta water if needed to loosen up the sauce and coat the pasta. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls. Sprinkle more Parmesan on each plate. Enjoy!",

Season to taste with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low.\n\n**Sauce the pasta:**\n\n1. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat, adding the remaining \u00bd cup pasta water as needed to loosen up the sauce. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls. Garnish with fresh basil and more grated Parmigiano Reggiano if you like. Enjoy!",

If you prefer, you can also use another type of sausage or omit it altogether for a vegetarian version.\n5. Don\u2019t overcrowd the pan when cooking the vegetables, as this can cause them to become soggy instead of getting nicely caramelized.\n6. You can adjust the amount of oil you use in the recipe to your liking. You can also substitute the vegetable oil with another type of oil, such as olive oil.\n7. This dish can be served hot or cold, so it\u2019s a great option for leftovers or meal prep.\n8. You can top the dish with or chopped fresh herbs like parsley or dill for added flavour and texture.",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally:** [**Skillet Lasagna Recipe**](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/skillet-lasagna-recipe\/)\n\nI should preface this by saying that this recipe was kind of an accident. I wanted to make skillet lasagna but didn't realize that that was a class of recipes that mostly involved chopping up some cooked pasta, tossing it with sauce, and finishing with cheese. instead, this is literally lasagna in a skillet.\n\nI do like that if you use no-boil pasta sheets, everything can be done in one skillet (I used an 11-inch skillet), and I like that it gives ya a bigger ratio of crispy pasta edges than with baking-tray lasagna. I will definitely be making this kind of lasagna again in the future! If you have questions about how I layered it, let me know. It was kind of hard to explain in the recipe instructions! I do have progress pics of the lasagna if anyone want to see how it came together!!\n\nPrep Time: 15 minutes\n\nCook Time: 1 hour 10 minutes\n\nInactive time: 40 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 2 hours 5 minutes\n\nServings: 8\n\nCalories: 477kcal per slice\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Sauce:**\n\n* 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil\n* 1 pound ground beef\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning\n* \u00bd teaspoon onion powder\n* Crushed red pepper to taste\n* 24 ounces jar of your favorite tomato sauce\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Spinach-ricotta filling:\n* 5 ounces baby spinach\n* \u00bc cup water\n* 16 ounces ricotta\n* 1 egg\n* \u00bd cup grated mozzarella cheese\n* \u00bc cup grated Parmigiano-reggiano\n* \u00bd lemon, juiced\n* 2 tablespoons fresh basil, finely chopped\n* 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**For assembly:**\n\n* 12 ounces lasagna sheets\n* 1\u00bd cups grated mozzarella\n* Extra virgin olive oil\n\n**For serving:**\n\n* Fresh basil leaves\n\n**Instructions**\n\n**Prepare the noodles:**\n\n1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil if you aren't using no-boil lasagna. Cook the lasagna sheets for exactly 5 minutes. If you aren't ready to assemble the lasagna immediately, rinse the lasagna sheets with cold water to prevent them from sticking. Transfer them in a stack to a cutting board and cut them in half crosswise.\n2. If using no-boil lasagna sheets, soften them in water for 15 minutes. Then, cut in half crosswise and set aside.\n\n**Prepare the spinach:**\n\n1. In an 11-inch skillet, heat 1\/4 cup water over medium heat until warm. Add the spinach and cook for 5 minutes, occasionally stirring, until it wilts. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and place the plate in the freezer for 10 minutes. Remove the spinach from the freezer and squeeze out all excess water. Roughly chop the spinach and set aside.\n2. Wipe out the skillet and return it to the stovetop.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. In the same skillet, heat 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil. Add the beef and onion and cook, often stirring, for 10\u201315 minutes until the beef is browned and the onion softens. Drain off excess fat if needed. Season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, onion powder, and a generous sprinkle of crushed red pepper. Cook for 1\u20132 minutes.\n2. Pour in the prepared sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20\u201330 minutes until thickened. Taste and season to your preferences.\n\n**Prepare the spinach-ricotta filling:**\n\n1. In a bowl, combine the ricotta, egg, mozzarella cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, lemon juice, fresh basil, and fresh parsley, and stir until the egg is completely incorporated into the cheese and the mixture is well-combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the reserved, chopped spinach and toss to combine. Set aside.\n\n**Assemble the lasagna:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350\u00baF.\n2. Spoon out \u00be of the tomato sauce into a bowl. You should have enough left in the skillet to coat the bottom with a thin layer of sauce.\n3. Divide the lasagna sheets into thirds. Arrange one-third of the lasagna squares in a circle, with the squares slightly overlapping each other. Place two squares in the center and ensure that the bottom of the skillet is covered with pasta.\n4. Cover the pasta with half of the ricotta filling and smooth it into an even layer. Add a third of the reserved sauce and smooth it into an even layer over the cheese. Sprinkle with half the mozzarella cheese.\n5. Add the second pile of lasagna sheets in the same pattern as the first, ensuring the squares overlap and placing two squares in the center. Add half of the remaining pasta sauce and the remaining ricotta filling and smooth into an even layer. Arrange all of the remaining pasta sheets on top and smooth the remaining pasta sauce on top. Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese. Drizzle the top of the lasagna with 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil.\n\n**Bake the lasagna:**\n\n1. Cover the skillet with foil and transfer to the oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and broil for 3\u20135 minutes to brown the top of the cheese.\n2. Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Garnish the lasagna with fresh basil leaves. Cut into eight slices and enjoy!",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally:** [**Manicotti Recipe**](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/manicotti-recipe\/)\n\n**Sauce:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n* 1 large yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 8 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* \u00bc cup tomato paste\n* 1 28- ounce can crushed tomatoes\n* 1 15- ounce can crushed tomatoes\n* 1 tablespoon sugar\n* Crushed red pepper to taste\n* 4 sprigs basil\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Filling:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n* 16- ounce package fresh spinach or use 2 10-ounce packages frozen, thawed spinach\n* 16 ounces ricotta cheese\n* 8 ounces (2 cups) grated mozzarella cheese\n* 2 eggs\n* 8 basil leaves, minced\n* \u00bd lemon, juiced\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**For serving:**\n\n* 8-ounce package manicotti\n* \u00bd cup grated mozzarella\n* Fresh basil leaves, optional\n\n**Instructions**\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 6\u20138 minutes. Add the butter to the pot. Once melted, add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n2. Add the tomato paste and mash it into the onion and garlic. Cook for 4\u20135 minutes until it deepens in color.\n3. Add the crushed tomatoes, sugar, crushed red pepper, and basil sprigs. Season liberally with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low.\n4. Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and continue simmering for at least 1 hour, uncovered, until the sauce is thick and jammy. Taste and season to your preferences, and discard the basil sprigs.\n\n**Cook the spinach (optional):**\n\n1. If using fresh spinach\\*, heat 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet. Once hot, add the spinach and \u00bc cup of water. Cook, turning regularly, until the spinach wilts completely. Season lightly with salt and pepper.\n2. Place the spinach on a paper towel-lined plate in an even layer. Transfer to the freezer for 5\u201310 minutes. Once the spinach is cool enough to handle, squeeze out all of the excess moisture and then roughly chop. Set aside. \n\n**Prepare the cheese filling:**\n1. Mix the ricotta, mozzarella, eggs, basil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper in a large bowl. Mix with a spoon until smooth.\n2. Add the chopped spinach and stir until combined. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until needed.\n\n**Cook the manicotti (optional):**\n\n1. If parboiling the manicotti, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil first. Add the manicotti and cook for precisely 5 minutes. Drain and rinse until cold water. Set aside. *(See boiling notes below.)*\n\n**Prepare the manicotti:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350\u00baF.\n2. Add half the pasta sauce to the bottom of a 9\u201dx13\u201d baking dish and smooth it into an even layer. Set aside.\n3. Stuff the manicotti with the filling using a long spoon or a piping bag. Be sure each piece of pasta is fully stuffed, but be careful not to overstuff as it will split the pasta. Place the stuffed manicotti into the baking dish on top of the sauce. Continue on until all of the manicotti are stuffed.\n4. Spoon 1\u20132 cups more sauce on top of the manicotti and smooth into an even layer. Sprinkle the remaining \u00bd cup mozzarella on top of the manicotti. Cover the baking dish with foil and transfer it to the oven. Bake, covered, for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes.\n5. Turn on the broiler and broil for 1\u20133 minutes until the cheese is browned and bubbly. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5\u201310 minutes.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Scatter a few fresh basil leaves on top of the casserole. Serve the manicotti with any remaining pasta sauce. Enjoy!\n\n**Notes:**\n\n\\*If using frozen, thawed spinach, skip saut\u00e9ing and freezing the spinach. Simply chop it up and continue with the recipe as-is.\n\nYou don't have to boil the manicotti! Here are my suggestions depending on how you want to boil the pasta:\n\n* **No boil:** Cover and bake the casserole for 55 minutes at 350\u00baF. Remove the cover, bake for 10 minutes more, and then broil for 1\u20133 minutes.\n* **5 minute boil time:** Cover and bake the casserole for 40 minutes at 350\u00baF. Remove the cover, bake for 5 minutes more, and then broil for 1\u20133 minutes.\n* **9 minute boil time\\*:** Bake uncovered for 30 minutes at 400\u00baF. Broil for 1\u20133 minutes.\n\n\\*This is based off the recipe on the back of the Barilla box. It\u2019s the shortest baking time which may be tempting, but these will be the most difficult to stuff. While you can make manicotti without boiling the noodles, I do recommend a 5 minute boil time for the shortest baking time.",

I think pasta al forno may typically have pork, veal, or sausage in it...I made mine with mushrooms, but you can add whatever meat you want. just cook it first, then do the mushrooms, and so on...and add the cooked meat back with the tomatoes.\n\n**Mushroom-tomato sauce:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil, plus more if needed\n* 1 pound mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 1\/2 teaspoon dry thyme\n* Crushed red pepper, to taste\n* 1\/4 cup sweet vermouth\n* 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes\n* 8-ounce jar tomato sauce of choice\n* Pinch of sugar\n* 10 basil leaves, roughly chopped\n* 1\/3 cup fresh parsley, minced\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**B\u00e9chamel:**\n\n* 1\/4 cup butter\n* 3 tablespoons flour\n* 2 1\/2 cups whole milk, warmed in the microwave for 1\u20132 minutes\n* Pinch of white pepper\n* Salt\n\n**For assembly:**\n\n* 16 ounces rigatoni\n* 6 ounces grated mozzarella\n* 4 ounces grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\n* Freshly ground black pepper\n* Fresh basil, for serving\n\n**Prepare the mushroom-tomato sauce:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400\u00baF.\n2. heat neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add half the mushrooms and cook for 8\u201310 minutes until they turn golden brown and crisp up around the edges. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl. Add a bit more oil and the remaining mushrooms, and cook an additional 8\u201310 minutes. Transfer to the bowl of mushrooms.\n3. Add the onion to the pot and cook for 5\u20136 minutes until it begins to soften. Return the mushrooms to the pot and add the garlic, dry thyme, and a big pinch of crushed red pepper.\n4. Turn the heat to high, and as soon as the mushrooms begin sizzling hard in the pot (be careful not to burn them!), pour in the sweet vermouth. Stir to lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat and cook for 3\u20134 minutes.\n5. Add the crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce to the pot and bring to a boil. Add a pinch of sugar if you like. Reduce heat and stir in the basil and parsley. Simmer, uncovered, for 30\u201340 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Cook the pasta:**\n\n1.

Stir it into the butter and cook for 1\u20132 minutes until nutty and fragrant.\n2. Add a ladle of the milk and whisk constantly until a slurry forms. Continue ladling in the milk, whisking after each addition, until all the milk has been incorporated and the sauce is smooth.

Boil water in a small pot. Once the water starts to boil add the russet potatoes and boil for 15-20 minutes. The time will vary due to the size of the potatoes. Use a fork to poke it and if the fork slides in easily it is cooked.\n2. Take the russet potatoes out and let them cool down. Once it's slightly cooled down and can be handled begin to peel the skin off. Use a sharp knife and score the skin down to make it easier to peel.\n3. Put the peeled cooked potato through a potato ricer to get a soft and consistent texture.\n4. Lay out the paper towel and spread the pumpkin puree on top and let it sit for 2-3 minutes. Complete this step 2-3 times until the pumpkin puree is dry.\n5. Mix the flour, dried pumpkin puree, potatoes and salt in a bowl. The dough should be a soft texture. Add minimal flour if the dough is too wet. Avoid adding too much flour this will make the gnocchi tough in texture once cooked.\n6. Dust a flat surface with flour and pour the dough and knead for about 5 minutes. Cut the dough into 6 pieces. Roll into a 1-inch rope and cut into 1-inch wide pieces.\n\nForming the pumpkin shape gnocchi\n\n1. Roll the cut pieces of dough into a ball with both of your hands in a circular motion. Press the ball down from the top to give it a flattened pumpkin shape. The best tool to create the pumpkin grooves is with a toothpick or string. Press down from the top and press along the sides. I do this 4 times on the top to create the groves all around the pumpkin.\n2. Freeze for 30 minutes to keep the shape before cooking.\n\nCooking\n\n1. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook the pumpkin gnocchi for 1-2 minutes or until the pumpkin gnocchi floats to the top.\n2. In a medium saucepan melt the butter and add the garlic and ginger on medium heat. Cook for 2-3 minutes until you can smell the garlic and singer infuse into the butter. Add the soy sauce and sesame oil. Stir for 30 seconds and add the cook pumpkin gnocchi and mix well. Place the cloves on top of each pumpkin gnocchi to make them look more realistic.\n3. Serve immediately. Remember to remove the cloves as they aren\u2019t edible.\n\n**Tips**\n\nFreeze the pumpkin-shaped gnocchi in the freezer for 30 minutes to hold the shape better before cooking.",

Cook until translucent and soft, 3-5 minutes. Add the garlic, and cook until no longer raw.\n\n**STEP 2**\n\nPour in the vodka and cook, stirring, until mostly evaporated; about a minute. Then add the crushed tomatoes, spices, herbs, and salt. Cook until this resembles a paste, stirring occasionally.\n\n**STEP 3**\n\nAdd the water and pasta, stirring to dissolve the paste into the water and mixing everything together.\n\n**STEP 4**\n\n**FOR STOVETOP:**\n\nReduce the heat to medium, then cover the pan with a lid cooking until the noodles are done per package instructions or to your taste. Stir every few minutes to prevent the noodles from sticking together.

Cook the spaghetti according to packet instructions in salt water. Save some of that pasta water. Keep it al dante.\n2. Chopping isn\u2019t fun but you gotta do what you gotta do. Chop the onion into small cubes and garlic finely.\n3. I prefer cast iron in this kind of recipes but you can use non-stick or any kind. Add some (or may be, a lot more than \u2018some\u2019) olive oil. Keep the heat on medium.\n4. Add the garlic and onion. Fry for a minute. Don't burn it or brown it too much.\n5. Next, add the dried herbs and chili flakes and a pinch or two of sugar. Fry until the onion\u2019s translucent.\n6. Time for the tomato puree to go in. Mix well and cook for 2 minutes.\n7. Add a splash of milk and mix and cook for 2 minutes.\n8. Drop a little pasta water and cover &amp; cook for 10 to 12 minutes or until the raw smell of tomato disappears.\n9.

Drain and set aside until needed.\r\n2. Pat the little smokies dry with paper towels and cut them into thirds (I do an angled cut).\r\n3. Warm a drizzle of olive oil (about 2 tsp) over medium heat in a large skillet. Once warm, add the sliced sausages and cook, stirring occasionally, until they\u2019re crispy, about 3-5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm, do not wipe the skillet clean.\r\n4. Reduce heat to medium-low and add the butter to the pan. Once melted, add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring constantly, for about 1 minute (should be fragrant), then add the condensed soup (do NOT add the water as directed on the can). Mix to incorporate.\r\n5. To the soup add the half-and-half, chicken stock, white sugar, onion powder, thyme, oregano, and black pepper. Raise the heat to medium to bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.\r\n6. Add the parmesan and mix until fully melted and incorporated. Taste the sauce and add salt to taste if desired.\r\n7. Remove the skillet from heat. Add in the cooked pasta and sausages, mix together. Serve immediately, topped with more parmesan and fresh basil.\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear your feedback in the comments!**",

Below is what I ended up doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n**Mac &amp; cheese**\n\n* 1lb conchigliette (mini shell) pasta\n* 4 tbsp butter\n* 1\/4 cup flour\n* 4oz can of green chiles\n* 2 fresh jalape\u00f1os, roughly chopped. (I left the membrane and seeds in because mine is a spicy household, but you can scrape out the interior if you don\u2019t like spice.)\n* 5 green onions, roughly chopped\n* 1 tsp garlic powder\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 1 cup milk\n* 8 oz ghost pepper cheddar\n* 4 oz gruyere\n* 4 oz white American cheese\n* 2-3oz white Vermont cheddar (the previous three cheeses would have been fine, but I had a bit of extra Vermont cheddar that needed to be used so I threw it in as well.)\n* 1 tbsp sodium citrate\n* 1\/4 tsp salt\n* 1\/4 tsp MSG\n* 1\/2 tsp dijon mustard\n* 1 tsp hot sauce\n\n**Topping**\n\n* 2 tbsp butter\n* 1\/2 cup panko\n\nThe directions are basically the same as above. The only alterations are that I added the last five ingredients to the sauce once the cheeses started to melt and thicken. Some people might say the sodium citrate is unnecessary if I\u2019m already adding American cheese, but all I know is that I\u2019ve been tweaking this Mac &amp; cheese recipe for a long time and this combination is perfect for that thick, creamy consistency I love.\n\nOnce the pasta was mixed in, I put the combined Mac &amp; cheese in an oven safe dish then topped it with the butter+panko mixture and baked at 375F for about 15 min.\n\nUnfortunately, once I opened one, it turned out my avocados were not yet ripe so I wasn\u2019t even able to use them. Oh well. It was absolutely delicious as is and I\u2019m looking forward to trying it again with avos. It\u2019s a heavy dish so maybe in a month or two.\n\nWe also topped it with pulled pork and chopped fresh parsley, basil, and green onion. It\u2019s not nearly as pretty or color corrected as the picture from the original recipe, but here\u2019s the finished result: [link](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ezhGOHz.jpg)\n\nThanks for reading!",

You can definitely add to this recipe. Garlic, spinach, kale, or cherry tomatoes would be great additions! If you eat meat, you can also add a protein like sweet Italian sausage or grilled chicken.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced\n* 1 cup loosely packed basil, divided\n* 8 ounces plant-based or dairy cream cheese\n* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (or basil-flavored oil)\n* 16 ounces paccheri or rigatoni\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Roughly chop the basil and set it aside.\n2. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook, stirring often, for 25\u201330 minutes until caramelized. Stir regularly and adjust the heat as needed to prevent the onions from burning. Season with salt and pepper.\n3. As the onion cooks, combine the cream cheese and half the basil in a food processor. Pulse until completely blended. Add water, as needed, in tablespoon increments until the mixture is smooth and creamy. You will likely need 2\u20133 tablespoons of water total. Season with salt, to taste.\n4. Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the paccheri and cook until al dente. Scoop out 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta and set it aside.\n5. Add the pasta cooking water to the caramelized onions and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes or until the liquid reduces by half. Add the remaining basil and the pasta and cook for an additional minute or two. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Turn off the heat.\n6. Spoon the basil cream onto plates and smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Pile the pasta on top of the cream and serve with a few additional basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil if you like. Enjoy!",

Cook your beef for as long or for as little as you want. I\u2019m cooking mine for 40 minutes because I love my beef well done. Once the beef is cooked, set stock from the beef aside. Deep fry your beef and set it aside.\n\n\n2. Boil your pasta with some salt for 3 minutes less, drain the water and set it aside.\n\n\n3. Chop fresh tomatoes and other vegetables. Pour some oil into a pan, throw some chopped onions into it and let the onions fry for about 2 minutes. Afterward, add the chopped tomatoes and fry them for about 12-15 minutes. Keep checking up on it, and don\u2019t forget to keep stirring. Fry until it becomes soft and cooked.\n\n\n4. Once tomatoes are cooked, add stock from your cooked beef and stir. Then add half a cup of water and leave it to cook. After 10 minutes, add one shrimp Maggi cube, grated ginger, grated garlic, and the other spices which are; one teaspoon of black pepper, one teaspoon of chili powder pepper, and one teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of curry powder, 1\/4 teaspoon of oregano and stir. Add another half cup of water and leave it to boil for 7 more minutes.\n\n\n5. Then add chopped bell pepper, mushrooms, and chopped carrots, and leave it to cook.

Form into meatballs, I like them somewhere between a golf ball and tennis ball in size, then refrigerate for 1 hour.\n5. When ready to cook, heat the olive oil in a pan and cook in batches then set aside.\n6. In the same pan, add the remaining oil and fry off the garlic for 1-2 minutes.\n7. Add the wine and vinegar to the pan and make sure you scrape the pan to release all of the charred meatball juice.\n8. Add the tomatoes, season well and leave to simmer for 10 minutes.\n9. Return the meatballs to the pan and continue to simmer for at least 20 minutes.\n10. Serve with homemade pasta, chopped parsley and parmasan.\n\n**TIPS**\n* The fattier your meat the better it will taste - we're not here to lose weight. I used 20% fat beef and 12% fat pork.\n\n\n* Meatballs can be made the day before and left in the fridge.\n\n\n* The more browning you get on your meatballs and in the pan the better your sauce will taste.\n\n\n* The longer you simmer the sauce before adding the meatballs the thicker and richer it will become.",

Add the sausage and cook for 15 minutes, breaking it up as it cooks. Once the sausage is completely cooked through, transfer it to a bowl.\n\n#### Cook the aromatics:\n\n* Add the onion and sweet potato to the rendered fat from the sausage. Cook over medium heat for 8\u20139 minutes until just beginning to brown and soften. Season with salt and pepper.\n* Add the minced garlic and red Fresno chili pepper to the pot and cook for 1 minute.\n* Create a well in the middle of the vegetables and add the butter. Once melted and bubbly, add the oregano and thyme and let them sizzle in the butter for 30\u201345 seconds. Toss to coat the vegetables with spices.\n\n#### Deglaze the pot:\n\n* Pour in the water, stock, or wine, and scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot.

Add the chopped basil and the mascarpone cheese and cook for 5 minutes more.\n\n#### Cook the pasta:\n\n* While the rag\u00f9 simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the rigatoni until al dente. Next, scoop out 1\/2 cup of the pasta cooking water.\n\n#### Sauce the pasta:\n\n* Drain the ragu and add it to the sauce and toss to coat. Add a bit of the pasta cooking water to thin out the seasoning. You may not use it all! Turn off the heat once the pasta is glossy and coated with the sauce.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Divide the pasta between shallow bowls and garnish with more basil. Add a drizzle of chili oil, if you like. Enjoy!",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally: [Caramelized Onion \u201cCarbonara\u201d](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/caramelized-onion-carbonara-recipe\/)**\n\nThis caramelized onion \"carbonara\" recipe is a vegetarian take on the Roman classic. While there is no guanciale in this dish, smoked shoyu adds a great meaty flavor.\n\nIf you don't have smoked shoyu, you can add a touch of liquid smoke to taste or simply replace it with a touch of soy sauce.\n\nPrep Time: 10 minutes\n\nCook Time: 45 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 55 minutes\n\nServings: 4 \n\nCalories: 629kcal\n\n### Equipment\n\n* Wide saut\u00e9 pan\n* Large pot\n* Whisk\n* Colander, if needed\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 1 tablespoon butter\n* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n* 2 yellow onions peeled and diced\n* 2 teaspoons sugar\n* 16 ounces spaghetti, rigatoni, or bucatini\n* 1\u20132 tablespoons smoked shoyu more to taste if desired\n* 4 egg yolks\n* 2 eggs\n* \u2153 cup freshly grated parmesan plus more for serving\n* Freshly grated black pepper\n* Salt\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Caramelize the onions:\n\n* In a wide saut\u00e9 pan, heat the butter and extra virgin olive oil over medium heat until the butter is frothy and bubbly. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring regularly, until the onions deepen in color. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent it from burning. About 15 minutes in, add the sugar and smoked shoyu and continue cooking the onions for an additional 15\u201320 minutes until fully caramelized and deep, golden brown. Season with salt. Turn off the heat.\n\n#### Cook the pasta:\n\n* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until 1\u20132 minutes under al dente. Scoop out 1\u00bd cups of pasta cooking water and drain the pasta. Note: depending on how you time it, you may be ready to cook the eggs right as the pasta finishes cooking, in which case, you can just use tongs to transfer the pasta straight from the water to the pot of caramelized onions. If you aren't ready, just drain the pasta first!\n\n#### Prepare the egg mixture:\n\n* In a large bowl, combine the egg yolks, eggs, parmesan, and ground black pepper to taste. Whisk for 3\u20135 minutes until smooth and creamy. Set aside.\n\n#### Temper the egg mixture and finish the carbonara:\n\n* Whisking constantly, pour half of the pasta cooking water into the bowl of eggs to temper the egg mixture.\n* Return the heat on the skillet of caramelized onions to medium-low. Add the cooked pasta and toss to coat with the onions.\n* Keeping the heat on low, slowly add the egg mixture, tossing regularly, until completely coated. Turn off the heat as soon as the sauce is coated, and the pasta is warmed through (about 1\u20132 minutes). If the sauce is quite thick, add more of the remaining pasta cooking water until the sauce reaches your desired consistency. It should be glossy and stick to the pasta! Taste and season with salt and more freshly ground pepper to taste.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Immediately serve the carbonara in shallow pasta bowls and garnish with more parmesan and black pepper.

        "recipe_comment":"When I was in Rome, I visited Tram Tram and fell in love with the orecchiette alla norma. It\u2019s not on the menu currently, but it was orecchiette in a red sauce and topped with small pieces of pan-fried eggplant. It was then topped with grated ricotta salata (the traditional way to serve pasta alla norma!). I didn\u2019t have ricotta salata, so I omitted it for this recipe.\n\nFor the eggplant, you can follow the Ottolenghi approach to peeling which involves alternating peeling off strips so the eggplant ends up looking like a zebra. Or, you can follow the Tram Tram (and my) approach and leave the skin on completely.\n\nThis pasta alla norma is a yummy take on pasta with crispy eggplant. Serve it with orecchiette and simple marinara for a delish dinner!\n\nPrep Time: 45 minutes\n\nCook Time: 45 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 1 hour 30 minutes\n\n Servings: 4 \n\nCalories: 620kcal\n\n### Equipment\n\n* Wide pot\n* Large pot\n* Skillet\n* Sieve\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* \u00be pound eggplant trimmed and small-diced\n* 2 pounds Roma tomatoes or use 28-ounce canned tomatoes\n* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 10 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* \u00bd teaspoon crushed red pepper more to taste if desired\n* 2 tablespoons plant-based or dairy butter\n* 1 pint cherry tomatoes optional\n* 16 ounces orecchiette or pasta or choice\n* 2 tablespoons avocado oil plus more if needed\n* 15 fresh basil leaves plus more for garnish\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Prepare the eggplant:\n\n* Transfer the diced eggplant to a sieve over a bowl and season liberally with salt. Set out at room temperature for 30 minutes as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.\n\n#### Blanch the tomatoes (if using fresh tomatoes):\n\n* Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes until the skin splits. Transfer the tomatoes to an ice bath for 5 minutes. Once the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, remove the skins and the cores. Crush lightly with your hands and transfer to a bowl.\n\n#### Prepare the sauce:\n\n* Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring regularly, for 6-8 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n#### Simmer the sauce:\n\n* Melt the butter into the garlic and onions. Once frothy, add the crushed tomatoes and mash lightly with a wooden spoon. Season with salt and pepper. Add 1\/4 cup of water and bring to a boil.\n* If using, add the cherry tomatoes to the sauce. Reduce heat and simmer for 35 minutes until reduced and thickened. Taste and season to your preferences.\n\n#### Cook the pasta:\n\n* 15 minutes before the sauce is finished, cook the pasta until al dente. Reserve \u00bd cup pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta.\n\n#### Cook the eggplant:\n\n* While the pasta cooks, heat 2 tablespoons of avocado oil in a skillet. While you wait for the oil to heat, pat the eggplant dry thoroughly with paper towels.\n* Cook the eggplant in batches in the hot oil for 2-3 minutes per side, stirring occasionally, until browned and crispy all over. Adjust the heat as necessary to prevent the eggplant from burning. Carefully transfer the eggplant to a paper towel-lined plate.\n\n#### Finish the sauce:\n\n* Lightly mash the cherry tomatoes and add the torn basil to the sauce. Immediately add the pasta and a few splashes of reserved pasta water and toss to coat the pasta with the sauce. Turn off the heat.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Divide the pasta between shallow bowls and pile the hot eggplant on top. Garnish with more basil leaves, if desired.

One batch makes around 9-10 cups (so about 10 small side servings) perfect for a gathering. Or, store it in the fridge for a week\u2019s worth of quick lunches!

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta according to package directions for al dente. Drain and run under cold water until cooled, set aside.\r\n2. Peel back the corn husk and silk, then use a knife to slice off the corn kernels. You should get about 3-4 cups depending on the size of the cobbs and how much you snack on. Subbing frozen or canned corn is not recommended. \r\n3. In a large mixing bowl combine all of the ingredients and 1 tsp of salt, mix until fully combined. Taste and add extra of any ingredient to your liking. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until ready to serve. \r  \n\n\nHope you enjoy it as much as we do!

        "recipe_comment":"Shortcut pumpkin ravioli!! Get the delicious homemade filling without the hassle of making fresh pasta!\n\nThis is one of my favorite freezer meals to make, it\u2019s so easy to pull these out for a quick lunch or dinner. They use premade dumpling wrappers to skip the process of forming the ravioli from scratch (which has its place, but for me that\u2019s much less often)! For a quick lunch I will just serve them tossed in olive oil, but if I\u2019m pulling them out for dinner I like to dress them up with browned butter and fresh thyme as pictured.\n\nYou can also use this as a filling in standard ravioli with the dough made from scratch and it\u2019s delicious, or apply this trick with your favorite ravioli filling. The result is a thinner pasta than a traditional ravioli but still a delicious meal.\n\n# Shortcut Pumpkin Ravioli\n\n**Makes:  50 rav, 6 servings  (\\~8 rav per serving)**\n\n# Ingredients\n\n**For batch prep:**\n\n* 2  15 oz cans of unflavored pumpkin puree\n* 1 pack of 50 dumpling\/potsticker wrappers\n* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic\n* 1 cup freshly grated parmesan (see note)\n* 4 tbsp butter\n* 3 tbsp light brown sugar\n* \u00bc tsp ground nutmeg\n* Salt\n\n**To prepare each serving (see instructions):**\n\n* 1 tbsp salted butter or olive oil\n* 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves (optional)\n\n**Notes**\n\nI do not recommend using canned parmesan in this recipe, it does not melt down as nicely.\n\n# Instructions\n\n1. Make sure your garlic is minced and parmesan is grated before beginning. Open your cans of pumpkin so they can be quickly added in a later step. In a small bowl combine the nutmeg, brown sugar, and 1 tsp of salt.\n2. Melt the butter over medium heat in a large skillet. Once melted, stir frequently until the butter browns and gives off a nutty smell, about 1 to 3 minutes depending on the temp of your stove. Once the butter is lightly browned add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 more minute.\n3. Quickly add the pumpkin to the skillet and mix to incorporate it into the butter and garlic mixture. Cook the pumpkin over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes.\n4. Sprinkle the sugar\/salt\/nutmeg mixture over the pumpkin in the skillet and mix to incorporate. Continue cooking for another 2 minutes.\n5. Remove from heat and mix in the grated parm, stir until it\u2019s fully incorporated. Allow the mixture to cool to room temp before filling the ravioli.\n6. To fill, place a leveled tablespoon of filling on the dumpling wrapper, slightly off-center (I use a cookie scoop for this step). Dip your finger into a small bowl of water and wet along the edge of the wrapper to seal, then fold the wrapper in half to create a semicircle. Pinch the wrapper closed, pressing from the edges in towards the center to avoid squeezing out any filling. (Optionally, press the tines of a fork around the edge to create the ridged ravioli look, this is just for looks and is not needed to seal the ravioli, typically I skip this step to save time.) \\[Note -- I have a picture that explains this better on my post to another sub, this sub doesnt allow multiple images\\]\n\n**To Freeze:**\n\n* Arrange the rav on a cookie sheet so they do not tough, freeze for 15+ mins then transfer to a zip bag to freeze long term. (If freezing, do not skip the cookie sheet step, otherwise they will all stick together in the bag and be ruined).\n\n**To Prepare:**\n\n* Boil the rav for 2 minutes (from frozen), or \\~90 seconds (fresh). I recommend freezing them first to help them hold their shape a bit better even if you\u2019re preparing them right away.\n* Toss each serving (\\~8 rav) in 1 tbsp of browned butter or 1 tbsp of olive oil, then optionally top with 1 tsp of fresh thyme leaves. (For a quick lunch I just do the olive oil, for a nicer meal I do the brown butter + thyme). To prepare the browned butter melt butter over medium heat, mix constantly until the butter begins to brown, then remove from heat and let cool for \\~3 mins before using.\n\nAlways happy to answer questions in the comments and I *really* appreciate it when people give feedback after making a recipe!! \n\nCheck out more of my recipes on my Reddit profile or [@CraftyCookbook](https:\/\/instagram.com\/craftycookbook?igshid=et7z4gbq8uva) on instagram.

This recipe comes together quickly, I can get it on the table in \\~20 mins.\n\nMakes 2 large restaurant-sized portions.\n\n# Ingredients\n\n* 8 oz bucatini or spaghetti\n* \u00bd cup whole milk ricotta (heaping)\n* 3 to 4 oz prosciutto (use 4 oz for a more loaded dish)\n* 1 cup packed baby arugula\n* \u00bc cup freshly grated parmesan\n* 1 lemon, zested and juiced\n* 2 tbsp olive oil\n* Freshly ground black pepper\n* Salt\n\n# Notes\n\n* Omit the prosciutto and add a little extra salt to the sauce for a vegetarian option.\n\n# Instructions\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0 F \n2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Loosely roll up each piece of prosciutto and arrange them on the baking sheet (see progress pictures). Bake until they shrivel and darken in color, about 10 minutes. \n3. Remove the baked prosciutto to a paper towel lined plate. Once cooled, tear into bite sized pieces. \n4. In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, olive oil, parmesan, lemon zest, \u00bc tsp black pepper, and 3 tbsp of the lemon juice (discard any extra). Season lightly with salt. \n5. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to the package directions for al dente. Reserve about \u00bd cup of pasta water, then drain. Return the pasta to the pot and cover to keep warm. \n6. Add the ricotta mixture to pasta and toss everything together, if the sauce is too thick add the reserved pasta water 1 tbsp at a time until a smooth sauce forms and coats the pasta evenly. Add in most of the prosciutto and arugula and toss further to distribute. \n7. Plate the pasta then top with more fresh cracked pepper and the remaining prosciutto and arugula. Serve immediately.\n\nI\u2019ve got some progress pictures up on my instagram that show the before and after on the prosciutto if you\u2019re looking for more detail there!

Caramelize the onion and fennel: Heat avocado oil in a wide pot over medium-low heat. Add the onions and fennel and cook, stirring regularly, for 30-35 minutes until the onions and fennel deepen in color. Season with salt and pepper. You can add a little sugar, if you like them a bit sweeter.\n2. Crisp the sage: Heat 1\/4 cup extra virgin olive oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add half the sage leaves, in batches, and cook for 2-3 seconds until crispy. Immediately transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season  with salt. Reserve the oil.\n3. Mince the remaining half of the sage and set aside.\n4. Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta til al dente. Reserve 3\/4 cup pasta water. Drain pasta. *Note: try to time this so that you're draining the pasta right as the onions finish caramelizing.*\n5.

You want the lobster to be fully submerged! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cook time will vary on the size of your lobster tail, so about 5-8 minutes is a safe bet.

Then pour the soy cream and let it steer for around 8-10minutes. \n3. **Grab the lasagna pasta**: follow the instruction on the pasta box for having it ready. \n4. **Layer it u**p: Start with a little sauce in the bottom of the pan to ensure your noodles don\u2019t stick to the bottom, then top with noodles, cream, and sauce and then repeat. Dump allllll of that extra mozzarella on the top for good measure!\n5. **Cover and bak**e: Covering the lasagna with foil to bake ensures that the moisture stays inside and cooks the noodles.

Pasta of choice\n\nWater, for boiling\n\nLots of salt, for pasta water\n\n\n1 lb. Ground Beef or Lamb\n\n1 Medium Sweet Onion, diced\n\n6 Garlic Cloves, minced\n\n1 Large Carrot, peeled &amp; grated (fine)\n\n1 28-oz. Can San Marzano Tomatoes\n\n1 Tbsp. Tomato Paste\n\n2 Tbsp. Salted Butter\n\nOregano, Dried Oregano, Red Pepper Flakes, Salt &amp; Pepper, to taste\n\nParmesan Cheese &amp; Black Pepper for topping\n\nSteps\n\nSauce:\n\n1. In a large pan with high sides, (or a dutch oven), melt butter over medium-high heat.\n\n2. Once butter is melted, add diced onion and stir to coat with butter. Add a pinch of salt, cook onion until soft and translucent, stirring semi-frequently, about 5-10 minutes.\n\n3. Once the onion is cooked, add garlic to an open space in the pot and cook, stirring occasionally until lightly browned and fragrant. Once lightly browned, stir together with the onion.\n\n4. Push onion and garlic mixture to the edge of the pan and add the ground beef or lamb. Break up the meat with a wooden spoon, season with more salt, and cook until no pink remains.\n\n5. Once the meat is cooked, reduce the heat to medium then add tomato paste, grated carrot, and canned tomatoes. Stir to fully combine.\n\n6. Add herbs and spices to your liking, (about a teaspoon of each to start), and stir to combine.\n\n7. Allow sauce to simmer, and once the sauce has been reduced slightly, (less watery liquid), turn the heat to low and keep covered while you prepare the pasta. (I recommend lifting the lid occasionally to give a quick stir. Also, taste a small amount of the sauce and adjust the seasoning to your liking, such as adding more salt, pepper, basil, etc.)\n\nPasta &amp; Assembly:\n\n1. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat.\n\n2. Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add a generous amount of salt and stir to combine.\n\n3. Add pasta and cook al dente according to box directions, stirring occasionally.\n\n4. With about half a minute left in the pasta\u2019s cook time, reserve a small amount, (roughly half a cup), of the pasta water and set it aside.\n\n5. Drain pasta then immediately add to the pan with sauce. Toss to combine. (When combining the pasta and the sauce, slowly drizzle in some of the pasta water to help the sauce bind to the pasta. You don\u2019t need to use all of what you\u2019ve set aside, but it\u2019s better to have too much reserved than too little.)\n\n6. Remove the pan from the heat and serve. Either transfer to a large serving dish or serve into bowls straight from the pan.\n\n7. Top with grated parmesan and a few grinds of black pepper.\n\n8. Enjoy! :)",

        "recipe_comment":"Tortellini is the most famous italian stuffed pasta and this is the classic recipe to do them at home. The ingredients are simple and genuine, the making of tortellini requires a little time and commitment but the taste worth the effort without doubt.\n\nFun fact: Legend claims that Tortellini was inspired by the goddess Venus' navel. One evening after a day of battle between Bologna and Modena, Venus, Bacchus and Mars found refreshment at the inn Corona in Castelfranco Emilia. The next morning Mars and Bacchus moved away from the inn leaving Venus dormant;\n\nWhen she woke up, she called the other companions to hear where they were. the innkeeper came to see if he could help and saw the little-dressed goddess was so impressed by its splendid shapes that he returned to the kitchen and created a pasta inspired by Venus' navel\u2026and so was born the Tortellini.\n\nAs usual if you like the recipe and want to subscribe you are welcome\n\nVideo recipe [HERE](https:\/\/youtu.be\/pM37CxZdXhk)\n\nServing for about 6 persons\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\nFor the filling\n\n* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) pork loin\n* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) mortadella\n* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )\n* 150 gr ( 5.29 ounce ) grated parmigiano\n* 10 gr ( 0.35 ounce )  butter\n* 2 eggs\n* nutmeg\n* black pepper\n* salt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the dough\n\n* 320 gr ( 11.29 ounce ) all-purpose  flour\n* 80 gr ( 2.82 ounce ) semolina flour\n* 4 eggs\n* 25 gr ( 0.88 ounce ) extra virgin olive oil\n* salt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**INSTRUCTION**\n\n* in a pan put 10 gr butter and 100 gr pork loin diced\n* let the pork loin brown well and drain from the excess of butter\n* in a meat grinder put the pork loin, 100 gr mortadella and 100 gr cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )\n* add to the mixture half nutmeg grated, 150 gr grated parmigiano, black pepper and 2 eggs\n* Mix well the mixture and add salt if needed ( you should taste the mixture because the flavor can vary depending on the type of cured ham and mortadella)\n* cover with a plastic wrap and let it rest for 2 hours\n\nNow let's prepare the homemade pasta as usual so 1 egg every 100 gr flours. For the flours we will use all-purpose and semolina flour in a proportion 4 to 1 so for this filling about 320 gr all-purpose and 80 gr semolina flour\n\n* Put the flours on a pastry board making a hole in the center where you will put 4 whole eggs and 25 gr extra virgin olive oil.\n* With a fork amalgamate the eggs and let the flour be incorporated, salt the dough and continue this operation until it will be possible to work it by hand.\n* work the dough until it is smooth and even. Leave it to rest in a film in the fridge for 30 minutes at least.\n* work the dough with a rolling pin and divide in several part\n* now with the help of a pasta machine begin to lower the thickness of the dough\n* the dough will be ready when it is less of one millimetre thick. I usually use the lower setting of thickness\n* now cut the pasta dough to obtain squares 4 cm long, i use a pasta cutter to obtain several squares at the time and speed up the process\n* Take a pasta square and put a little of filling in the middle then fold the square into a triangle. Finally, roll up the triangle and join the angles creating the typical shape of the tortellini like you can see in the video\n* if the pasta dries too much you can moisten the edges of the dough square with a finger wetted in a little water. this will help to seal the tortellini.\n* Put the tortellini on a tray lined with parchment paper. If you want you can also frozen tortellini, to do so put the tray in freezer a few hours, in this way they will remain intact and will not stick during freezing, when the tortellini are well frozen you can transfer them in bags to save space in the freezer\n* Cook tortellini into boiling beef and poultry stock. If frozen, do not unfreeze.\n* You can also prepare tortellini without broth. Cook them in abundant salted water, when they are ready ( 4\/5 minutes usually) drain them and season with a heavy cream sauce with ham and peas. If you want more precise instruction for this kind of seasoning ask in the comment section\n\nThat's all if you have any question feel free to ask and Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas  in advance \\^\\_\\^",

        "recipe_comment":"# [Creamy Kabocha Pasta](http:\/\/grumpygarbanzo.com\/Meals\/Creamy%20Kabocha%20Pasta\/)\n\nA kabocha squash makes an excellent door stop. It's hefty enough to prop your door firmly open while allowing the world to view your superb taste in squash. I know this because I bought a kabocha squash on a whim, ignored it for a week, and demoted it from food to doorstop for another week because I was too intimidated to attempt Thai curry at home.\n\nBut you know what's less intimidating than curry? Pasta.\n\nThis recipe boils down to a few steps (see what I did there?): roasting kabocha squash and removing the peel, caramelizing an onion, blending and seasoning the sauce, cooking pasta, and baking the squash skin to create a crunchy and pretentious topping. I seasoned my peels with smoked paprika for bacon vibes. You can blend the squash skin\u2013and\u2013all, but the sauce may turn an unpleasant color due to the dark peel mixing with the bright orange flesh. I hesitate to give exact measurements for the sauce because everyone has different taste preferences; just add small amounts of seasonings at a time, taste test, and stop messing with it when you've made a delicious sauce or are too tired to care anymore.\n\n# What:\n\n1 kabocha squash\n\n1 yellow onion\n\ngarlic\n\nnon-dairy milk\n\norecchiette pasta\n\nolive oil\n\nseasonings:\n\n* nutritional yeast\n* tomato paste\n* apple cider vinegar and\/or sour kraut juice\n* vegan chicken broth paste\n* soy sauce\n* chili paste or flakes\n* smoked paprika\n* salt &amp; pepper\n\n# How:\n\nPasta:\n\n* Cook orecchiette according to package. Reserve some pasta water (about 1\/3 cup) for the sauce.\n\nBlend the sauce:\n\n* Remove baked squash from the oven and let it cool enough that you can handle it without burning yourself.\n* Use a spoon to scoop the flesh of the squash from the skins and into a blender.\n* Add enough oat milk to allow the squash to blend into a paste. Make the sauce thicker than you would like, because it will be thinned by additional liquid ingredients.\n* Blend in the caramelized onions.\n* Now comes the experimentational part of the recipe: seasoning the sauce. This should be done to taste, but I'll explain what the ingredients do for the sauce and give rough estimations of the quantities I used. Melted vegan butter or oil (1.5 tbsp) will create a rich, creamy base. Our umami friends: tomato paste (1.5 tbsp), vegan chicken broth paste (1 tsp), and soy sauce (1 tbsp); add these a little at a time. Nutritional yeast (2\u20133 tbsp) will provide that almost\u2013cheesy flavor. Apple cider vinegar or sour kraut juice will give you a much\u2013needed tang to balance out the richness; add a little at a time. I think you know what chilis, salt, and pepper do. Use pasta water to thin the sauce to your final desired consistency.\n\nCrispy topping:\n\n* Toss or spritz the squash skins with oil. Salt and pepper to taste.\n* Bake at 450\u00baF until crispy.\n* Sprinkle with smoked paprika for a bacon\u2013ish flavor.\n\nAssemble:\n\n* Mix pasta with sauce over heat and top with crispy squash skins.\n\n# What did I use and why?\n\nOat milk: I find that it is the creamiest of vegan milks.\n\nBetter than Bouillon No Chicken Base: Because this is a paste, it's ideal for adding a bit at a time without diluting the sauce.\n\nTrader Joe's Italian Bomba Hot Pepper Sauce: I'm obsessed with this paste made from Calabrian chilis. It's fermented, but not funky, and a nice alternative to Sriracha.\n\n# [Recipe Link](http:\/\/grumpygarbanzo.com\/Meals\/Creamy%20Kabocha%20Pasta\/)",

(The one pictured above was Walnut &amp; Kale!)\n\nRecipe for the sauce can be found here!: https:\/\/bezeninthekitchen.com\/pesto\n\nIngredients\n\n2 Cups Leafy Greens (Basil, Spinach, Arugula, or Kale are best)\n\n3\/4 Cup Shredded Parmesan\n\n1\/2 Cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil\n\n1\/3 Cup Nuts, roasted (Pine Nuts, Walnuts, or Cashews are best)\n\n3-4 Cloves of Garlic, minced\n\nKosher Salt &amp; Black Pepper, to taste\n\nSteps\n\n1. Roast nuts in a small pan over medium heat until golden brown and fragrant, (when you REALLY smell them, you\u2019ll know they\u2019re ready), remove from heat and let cool slightly.\n\n2. In a large bowl, add your greens of choice, parmesan, roasted nuts, minced garlic, a pinch of salt, and a few grinds of black pepper and toss together lightly to combine.\n\n3. IF USING AN IMMERSION BLENDER: Pour olive oil over the top of the ingredients in the mixing bowl and blend together with the immersion blender. Start on a lower speed setting until the ingredients have reduced in volume by at least 50%, then blend on high speed until fully combined. (Feel free to make it as smooth or as chunky as you\u2019d like! Also, stop to clear the blade of the blender a few times as well as scrape down the sides of the bowl in the blending process, just DO NOT forget to unplug the blender first.)\n\n4. IF USING A REGULAR BLENDER: Add the ingredients from the mixing bowl to the blender and blitz together ingredients have reduced in size and appear more or less combined. Then, add the olive oil and continue to blend until reaching your desired consistency. (Also stop to scrape down the sides of the blender, as necessary.)\n\n5. Now, it will be ready for whatever use you want! Pasta, pizza, sandwiches, it does not matter\u2026 but if you are not using it right away, press plastic wrap on the top of the pesto and make sure there are no air pockets, then place in the fridge until ready for use, (this will protect the bright green color of the pesto, if there is too much air, the sauce will turn a sickly brown).\n\n6.

        "recipe_comment":"Recipe here originally: [Creamy Rigatoni with Seared Scallops](https:\/\/triedtrue.us\/RigatoniScallops)\n\nThis creamy rigatoni with seared scallops is comfort-food heaven. Perfectly seared scallops nestled into a creamy, spicy sauce make for an incredible dinner!\n\nPrep Time: 15 minutes\n\nCook Time: 40 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 55 minutes\n\nServings: 4\n\nCalories: 751kcal\n\nAuthor: Kylie Perrotti\n\n# Equipment\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Wide Pot\n* Large pot\n* Medium Skillet\n\n# Ingredients\n\n**Spicy Rigatoni:**\n\n* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil\n* 1 sweet onion peeled and sliced into thin wedges\n* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* 2 tablespoons capers drained\n* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper more or less to taste\n* 1 cup white wine or chicken stock\n* 1 cup chicken stock\n* 1 pint cherry tomatoes quartered\n* 1\/2 cup heavy cream\n* 16 ounces dry rigatoni\n* 1 lemon juiced\n* 1\/2 cup fresh parsley leaves minced\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Scallops:**\n\n* 1 pound dry-packed sea scallops muscle removed\n* 2 teaspoons neutral cooking oil\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n# Instructions\n\nStart the Sauce:\n\n* In a wide pot, heat the neutral cooking oil over medium heat until hot. Add the onion and cook for 5-6 minutes until just beginning to soften.\n* Add the garlic, capers, and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\nDeglaze the Pan:\n\n* Add the white wine and chicken stock and bring to a boil.\n\nSimmer the Sauce:\n\n* Add the cherry tomatoes to the sauce and bring to a boil. Taste and season lightly with salt and pepper. The capers and chicken stock will lend a lot of salt to this recipe, so be careful with salting too heavily. Reduce heat and simmer as you prepare the rest of the meal.\n\nBoil the Pasta:\n\n* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the rigatoni and cook for about 2-3 minutes under al dente.\n\nFinish the Sauce:\n\n* Pour the heavy cream into the sauce. Scoop out 1\/3 cup pasta water from the rigatoni and add it to the sauce. Using a spider strainer, add the slightly undercooked rigatoni directly to the sauce. Bring to a very gentle bubble \u2013 not boiling, but slightly above a simmer. And cook for 5-7 minutes more until the sauce is very thick and the pasta is tender. Stir in the lemon juice and minced parsley. Taste and season again to your preference.\n\nSear the Scallops:\n\n* Pat the scallops dry. Season lightly with salt and pepper and pat dry again.\n* Heat the oil in a skillet over high heat. Melt the butter into the skillet. Once melted and frothy, add the scallops, without overcrowding the pan, and cook for 1-2 minutes until very well seared. Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes more until the scallops are opaque and cooked through.\n* Turn off the heat on the scallops and immediately transfer the scallops on top of the pasta in the skillet. Turn off the heat.\n\nTo Serve:\n\n* Divide the pasta and scallops between shallow bowls. Garnish with more minced parsley, if desired.

        "recipe_comment":"  \n\nRecipe as follows and a link to a short video of the process below.\n\n**Black Trumpet Tagliatelle**\n\nIngredients\n\n430 g 00 Flour\n\n20 g dehydrated wild mushroom powder\n\n250 g eggs (beaten before mixing)\n\n\\*Portioned for 5 - 6 people\n\nDirections\n\n1. Using a spice grinder (or similar) blitz your dried mushrooms into a very fine powder. Here I\u2019m using black trumpets but you could easily substitute with any other edible wild mushroom.\n\n2. Mix together the mushroom powder and flour into a bowl, and dump out onto your clean work surface.\n\n3. Use your hand to form a well (like a volcano) in the center of the flour.\n\n4. Carefully pour your eggs into the center and begin slowly mixing together with a fork. Gradually, carefully, work your way all around to incorporate the eggs with the flour, without breaking the outer wall.\n\n5. After about 5 - 10 minutes it will start coming together into a shaggy mass. Begin using your hands to knead the dough together. Work diligently for another 5 minutes until it is no longer shaggy.\n\n6. Use the edges of your hands, knuckles, to work the dough until it starts to form a smooth ball. Roll it, applying pressure, into the work surface. Fold it. Roll it again. After about ten minutes it should be a smooth, and ready to rest.\n\n7. Cut the dough into two and wrap each in plastic wrap. Set into the fridge for at least 30 minutes.\n\n8. The following steps revolve around using a pasta attachment on a Kitchenaid - but you could also do this by hand with a rolling pin. Remove one of the dough balls, unwrap, and cut off a portion of the dough. Lightly flour and cover the rest back with plastic. Press gently and form a rectangle.\n\n9. Pass the dough through the sheet pasta attachment at it\u2019s widest setting. If it feels sticky, add a little more flour. Gradually tighten the settings of the pasta attachment, one click at a time, and pass the pasta sheet through until it is light and delicate. For tagliatelle, I normally go to the 6th setting.\n\n10. Allow the sheet of dough (sfoglia) to dry for 2-3 minutes and fold in half. With a knife, trim off irregular edges. Gently fold the dough into about 3 inch folds, over and over until you have a nice compact roll.\n\n11. Using your knife, carefully begin cutting strips of the roll into about 1\/2 inch (1.3 cm) pieces. With your fingers, unroll each strip and sprinkle with a light coating of semolina. You can make little nests with each batch that is finished. Repeat until all of your dough has transformed unto tagliatelle.\n\n12. Cook right away of store in the fridge covered with a towel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Video of the process here.](https:\/\/youtu.be\/4SgGcPvvX0E)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cacio e pepe**\n\nIngredients\n\n1 1\/2 cups freshly grated Pecorino Romano\n\n1 1\/2 tsp. of freshly ground black pepper\n\n3 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil\n\nSalt\n\n1.5 cups pasta water\n\nDirections\n\n1. Bring a pot of water to a boil and add a dash of salt.\n\n2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and add in crushed black pepper. Stir until the pepper becomes very fragrant. Turn off the heat.\n\n3. Boil the fresh pasta.\n\n4. Reserve about 1.5 cups of pasta water as the pasta finishes. The starch from the water is why you wouldn\u2019t just use regular water here.\n\n5. Transfer the cooked pasta into the skillet with pepper and oil. Toss until all of the noodles are coated.\n\n6. Add about a cup of pasta water to the noodles and stir. This may feel like a lot but it will all come together when you\u2026\n\n7. Add all of the freshly grated Pecorino to the pasta, and stir very well until the cheese and water form a luxurious creamy coating all over the noodles. Add more pasta water as necessary.\n\n8. Divide the pasta into individual plates and sprinkle on a little more fresh Pecorino. Garnish with basil is optional.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Video of the process here.](https:\/\/youtu.be\/4SgGcPvvX0E)",

Heat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the ground chicken and cook for 5 minutes. Season with garlic powder, thyme, paprika, a big pinch of crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper. Continue saut\u00e9ing, breaking up the chicken as it cooks, for 10 minutes until it is cooked through.\n2. Transfer to a bowl.\n\n**Cook the vegetables:**\n\n1. Add another teaspoon of olive oil over medium heat if the pot seems dry. Add the mushrooms, onion, and celery. Saut\u00e9 for 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Simmer the soup:**\n\n1. Return the chicken to the pot. Add the diced tomatoes, 6 cups water, sugar, and balsamic vinegar. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.

You may wish to drizzle it with a touch of extra virgin olive oil before refrigerating to prevent it from sticking.*",

        "recipe_comment":"Ah, autumn! The season of cozy sweaters, crisp air, and heart-warming dishes. If there\u2019s one thing I absolutely adore when the leaves start to fall, it\u2019s a comforting chicken stew. And what better way to embrace the season than with a French classic?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Portions:** 4\n\n**Prep time: 30 min**\n\n**Cook time: 1,5h**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**\\* 4 Chicken legs separated into thighs and drumsticks**\n\n**\\* 3 cups Red Wine (750 ml) preferably Burgundy or a similar full-bodied wine**\n\n**\\* 1 cup Pearl Onions (200g) peeled**\n\n**\\* \u00bd cup Lardons (100g) or thick-cut bacon, diced**\n\n**\\* 3 Sprigs of fresh Thyme**\n\n**\\* 2 Bay Leaves**\n\n**\\* 4 Garlic Cloves minced**\n\n**\\* 2 Shallots finely chopped**\n\n**\\* 1 cup Button Mushrooms quartered**\n\n**\\* 2 tbsp Brandy (optional)**\n\n**\\* 2 tbsp Unsalted Butter**\n\n**\\* 2 tbsp All-purpose flour**\n\n**\\* Salt to taste**\n\n**\\* Black Pepper to taste**\n\n**\\* Fresh Parsley for garnish**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, red wine, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, minced garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well, ensuring the chicken is well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.\n2. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the lardons or bacon and cook until crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n3. In the same skillet, add the remaining butter. Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving the wine and herbs. Pat the chicken dry and brown on all sides, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set aside.\n4. Add the chopped shallots to the skillet and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for another minute. Add the mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and become golden.\n5. If using, pour the brandy over the vegetables and carefully ignite with a long lighter. Allow the flames to subside.\n6. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes.\n7. Pour in the reserved wine from the marinade, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Allow the wine to simmer and reduce by a third.\n8. Return the browned chicken pieces and crispy lardons to the skillet. Add the pearl onions, thyme, and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper.\n9. Stove top cooking method: Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let the chicken simmer in the wine for about 1-1.5 hours, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened.\n10. Dutch oven cooking method: After combining the chicken, lardons, pearl onions, thyme, and bay leaves in the Dutch oven, cover with the lid and bake in a preheated oven at 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C) for 1-1.5 hours until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened, checking occasionally and adding broth or water if needed.\n11. Once cooked, remove the thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve the Coq au Vin hot, sprinkled with fresh parsley. Pair with crusty French bread or potatoes and enjoy this classic French dish! I prepared potato pancakes to go with it \ud83d\ude42\n\nChefs Recipe Blog - [French Classic - Coq au Vin](https:\/\/chefsbinge.com\/coq-au-vin-classic-french-chicken-in-red-wine\/)",

        "recipe_comment":"On a rainy autumn day, nothing beats ducking into a pub with a pint of Guinness and a plate of Hunters Chicken with chips. This British Pub Grub classic ranks as my top choice. Dive into my recipe for this delectable comfort dish, featuring a homemade BBQ sauce enriched with fennel seeds. Preparing this recipe is a breeze, especially if you\u2019re short on time. You can whip up the BBQ sauce in advance, or, if you\u2019re really pressed, opt for a store-bought version.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Prep Time :** 25 minutes\n\n**Cook Time:** 30 minutes\n\n**Marination time:** 1hour\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients: for Homemade BBQ Sauce:**\n\n\\* 1 Small Onion finely chopped\n\n\\* 3 Garlic Cloves minced\n\n\\* 2 tbsp Olive Oil (for saut\u00e9ing)\n\n\\* 1 tsp Chilli Flakes (optional)\n\n\\* 1 tsp Fennel Seeds\n\n\\* 2 oz Dark Brown Sugar (55g)\n\n\\* 0.3 cups Dark Soy Sauce (75ml)\n\n\\* 1.2 cups Ketchup (280ml)\n\n\\* 2 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar\n\n\\* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce\n\n\\* 1 tsp Smoked Paprika\n\n\\* \u00bd tsp Black Pepper\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for Hunters Chicken:**\n\n\\* 2 Chicken Breasts skinless\n\n\\* 2 Garlic Cloves minced\n\n\\* 2 tbsp Olive Oil\n\n\\* \u00bc tsp Salt\n\n\\* \u00bd tsp Black Pepper\n\n\\* 8 Strips of Streaky Bacon\n\n\\* 1 cup Homemade BBQ Sauce (240ml)\n\n\\* 1 cup Mozzarella Cheese (100g)\n\n\\* 1 Medium Onion peeled and sliced (for laying the dish)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instructions for Homemade BBQ Sauce:**\n\n1. In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 until translucent.\n2. Add the minced garlic, red chilli, and fennel seeds. Cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant.\n3. Stir in the dark brown sugar and let it caramelize slightly for about 1-2 minutes.\n4. Pour in the dark soy sauce, tomato ketchup, apple cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well.\n5. Season with smoked paprika, ground black pepper, and salt.\n6. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes. This will allow the flavours to meld together.\n7. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.\n8. Once done, remove from heat and let it cool. The sauce will thicken as it cools.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instructions for Hunters Chicken:**\n\n1. In a mixing bowl, combine minced garlic, olive oil, salt, and black pepper. Add the chicken breasts, ensuring they are thoroughly coated with the mixture. Refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours, or preferably overnight. Before cooking, remove the chicken from the refrigerator and allow it to reach room temperature, approximately 20-30 minutes.\n2. Preheat your oven to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F).\n3. Place sliced onion at the bottom of your baking dish.\n4. Take each chicken breast and wrap it with two bacon rashers or strips. Once wrapped, position them on top of the sliced onions in the baking dish.\n5. Transfer the dish to the preheated oven and bake for approximately 25 minutes. Ensure the chicken is fully cooked and no longer pink in the centre.\n6. After baking, remove the chicken from the oven. Evenly spoon your BBQ sauce over and around each chicken piece. Generously sprinkle mozzarella cheeses over the chicken.\n7. Switch the oven to the grill setting. Return the dish to the oven and grill for an additional 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.\n8. Once done, serve the chicken hot, accompanied by chips or mashed potatoes plus veggies of your choice.

Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl to cool. Remove the garlic and transfer to a plate to cool.\n* Bring the broth back to a boil for 15 minutes until it reduces down a bit. (Note: you can skip this step, but I like a very rich, reduced broth).\n* Strain the broth into a bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.\n* Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat and discard the skin and carcass.\n* Pop the garlic cloves out of the paper and discard the paper. With a fork, mash the cloves into a paste and set aside.\n\n**Prepare the Chicken Verde Soup:**\n\n* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the sliced yellow onion and cook for 5 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic paste and cook for 45 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.\n* Pour in reserved chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the cilantro, scallions, jalape\u00f1o, and shredded chicken. Reduce heat and cook for 15 minutes or until the onion is very soft and the broth is aromatic. Taste and season to your preferences. Add more water if needed. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To Serve**\n\n* Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with the reserved cilantro, scallions and avocado. Squeeze lime juice over each bowl.

Warm the stock in a microwave or in a small pot on the stove. Turn heat to low and keep warm. Preheat oven to 425\u00baF.\n\n**Start the Risotto:**\n\n1. Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 2-3 minutes until it just begins to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook for 12-13 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are golden brown. \n2. They should release all their liquid, and the liquid should evaporate from the pan. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Cook the Chicken:**\n\n1. As the mushrooms are cooking, start the chicken. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat neutral cooking oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook without moving for 5 minutes until the skin is very crispy and browned. Flip the chicken and transfer to the oven for 20-25 minutes until completely cooked through. Turn off the oven and keep the chicken in the oven as you finish the risotto to keep it warm.\n\n**Cook the Rice:**\n\n1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the rice. Cook, stirring regularly, for 2-3 minutes until the rice is coated with butter and begins to turn golden brown.\n2. Add the aji amarillo paste and toss to coat.\n3. Pour in the white wine and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low.\n4. Once the wine has been absorbed, add 1 cup of the stock and stir regularly until absorbed. Continue on, adding a cup of stock, stirring until absorbed, and then adding more stock until all of the stock has been incorporated, about 20-25 minutes total. Taste and season to your preferences. Turn off the heat and allow the risotto to rest for 5 minutes before serving.\n\n**To Serve:**\n\n1. Divide the risotto between shallow bowls and serve with a chicken thigh on top. Garnish with parsley, if desired.

In a bowl, whisk together the cream and egg until smooth.\n2. Add \u00bd cup panko, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, a big pinch of crushed red pepper, and the Parmesan cheese. Mix until combined and add a pinch of salt and pepper.\n3. Add the turkey to the bowl and season with salt and pepper. Use your hands to mix until combined, adding more panko as needed. The mixture should hold together but still be moist and not too firm.\n4. Heat the olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add a tiny drop of the meatball mixture and fry until cooked through. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Reduce the heat on the pot to low while you roll the meatballs.\n5.

Tear the remaining basil leaves and add them to the sauce with the cooked pasta and toss to coat. Taste and season.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Serve the sauced pasta at the table with the platter of turkey meatballs. Enjoy!",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally:** [**Rotisserie Chicken Tacos**](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/rotisserie-chicken-tacos\/)\n\nI use a rotisserie chicken to make the tacos, and it's so good and a little less fussy than starting with raw on a weeknight. I also make use of leftover baked potatoes which work perfectly as a quick side dish. You can always use raw potatoes instead, but you'll just need to increase the roasting time!\n\nYou don't have to go so ham with all the sides and sauces like I did, but I didn't find this too labor-intensive because so many of the ingredients repeat across the sides. I also use bagged shredded cabbage for the slaw to save time :)\n\n**Chicken:**\n\n* 1 teaspoon neutral oil\n* 1 plain rotisserie chicken, meat picked from the bones and torn into bite-sized pieces; make sure you save the carcass for stock!\n* \u00bd small red onion, peeled and sliced; you\u2019ll use the other half in the slaw!\n* 1 tablespoon chili powder\n* 1 tablespoon cumin powder\n* 1 teaspoon paprika\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* \u00bd cup salsa verde or your favorite tomato salsa\n* \u00bc cup water, plus more as needed\n* Salt, if needed\n\n**Potatoes:**\n\n* 2 leftover baked potatoes, cut into cubes\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 2 teaspoons chili powder\n* 2 teaspoons cumin powder\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* \u00bc teaspoon cayenne powder\n* 1 lime, optional\n\n**Slaw:**\n\n* 10 ounces shredded red cabbage\n* 1 English cucumber, thinly sliced\n* 1 small jalape\u00f1o, peeled and minced\n* \u2153 cup loosely packed cilantro, minced\n* \u00bd small red onion, peeled and thinly sliced\n* 4 tablespoons mayonnaise\n* 1 grapefruit, juiced\n* 2 teaspoons sugar, plus more to taste\n* 1 teaspoon chili powder\n* Salt to taste\n\n**Avocado sauce:**\n\n* 1 large avocado, peeled and pitted\n* \u2153 cup sour cream\n* 1\u20132 limes, juiced; use 1 lime if you don\u2019t want it so tangy!\n* \u00bd cup loosely packed cilantro\n* 1\u20132 tablespoons water, plus more as needed\n* Salt\n\n**For serving:**\n\n* 12 small flour or corn tortillas\n\n**Make the chicken:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF.\n2. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and red onion and cook for 2\u20133 minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, and garlic powder, and cook for 2 minutes until fragrant.\n3. Pour in the salsa and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer as you prepare the rest of the recipe. Taste and add salt, if needed. Add more water as needed if the chicken begins to stick as it simmers.\n\n**Make the potatoes:**\n\n1. Toss the cubed potatoes on a baking sheet with the oil and spices. Season with salt and transfer to the oven for 15 minutes until they begin to crisp up around the edges. Remove from the oven and juice the lime over the potatoes if you like. Keep warm. *Note: If using raw potatoes, roast for 35\u201340 minutes instead.*\n\n**Make the slaw:**\n\n1. Gather the cabbage, cucumber, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, and red onion in a large bowl. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and set aside.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, grapefruit juice, sugar, chili powder, and a big pinch of salt. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.\n3. Pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Transfer to the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\n\n**Make the avocado sauce:**\n\n1. While the potatoes roast, make the slaw and transfer to the refrigerator\u2013ideally for 30 minutes\u2013but it\u2019s okay to enjoy it a little sooner :)\n2. Combine the avocado, sour cream, lime juice, and cilantro in a food processor and pulse until smooth. Add water, starting with 1\u20132 tablespoons\u2013and pulse until smooth. Add more water until the sauce reaches a drizzling consistency. Taste and add salt. Note: if you don\u2019t want to break out the food processor, you can mash the avocado and mince the cilantro. Simply mash all of the ingredients together with a fork until mostly smooth.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Warm up the tortillas and pile the chicken on each tortilla. Drizzle with the avocado sauce and add a spoonful of slaw on top. Serve with the warm potatoes on the side. Enjoy!",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally:** [**Chicken Katsu Udon Recipe**](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/chicken-katsu-udon-soup-recipe\/)\n\nSome people have asked why i didn't make the katsu sauce...I was replicating this off a soup i used to get at a local restaurant and they never served with the katsu sauce. i like the pairing of the crispy chicken with the light broth... if you like the sauce, you can definitely serve it on top!\n\n**Udon:**\n\n* 4 scallions, white and light green parts kept separate\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced\n* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced\n* 2 teaspoons minced ginger\n* 4 cloves garlic, minced\n* 5 cups water\n* 2 teaspoons dashi granules\n* \u00bc cup light soy sauce, more to taste\n* 2 tablespoons mirin\n* 2 teaspoons sesame oil, divided\n* 16 ounces frozen or dry udon\n* 10 ounces broccoli florets\n* 2 teaspoons sesame seeds\n* Salt\n\n**Chicken:**\n\n* 1 pound thin-sliced chicken breasts\n* 1 cup all-purpose flour\n* \u00bd teaspoon white pepper\n* 1\u20132 teaspoons shichimi togarashi\n* 4 eggs\n* 2 cups panko\n* Salt and pepper\n* Vegetable oil for frying\n\n**Prepare the scallions:**\n\n1. Mince the white parts of the scallions and set them aside. Thinly slice the green parts on a steep bias and transfer them to a small bowl. Set aside.\n\n**Prepare the broth:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and mushrooms and cook for 6\u20138 minutes. Season lightly with salt.\n2. Add the ginger, garlic, and minced white parts of the scallions. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n3. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add the dashi granules, soy sauce, mirin, and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Simmer as you prepare the chicken and noodles.\n\n**Cook the noodles:**\n\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the udon and cook according to package instructions. Drain and rinse. Divide the noodles between bowls.\n\n**Dredge the chicken:**\n\n1. Heat 1\u00bd inch of oil in a medium-sized pot until it reaches 350\u00baF. Test the oil temperature with an instant-read thermometer. Adjust the heat as needed between medium-low and medium-high to keep a consistent temperature for frying.\n2. Prepare your dredging station by setting out three large shallow bowls. Add the flour, white pepper, and shichimi togarashi to the first bowl. Use 1 teaspoon shichimi togarashi for a subtle heat or 2 teaspoons for spicier undertones in the breading.\n3. Crack the eggs into the second bowl and whisk with a fork until well beaten.\n4. In the third bowl, add the panko and a pinch of salt.\n5. Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.\n6. Dip one piece of chicken into the flour until fully coated. Shake off the excess and then dip it into the beaten eggs. Ensure the chicken is completely coated with eggs. Allow any excess to drip off and then dip into the panko. Use your fingers to press the panko into each piece of chicken evenly. Transfer to a wire rack and continue on until all the chicken is breaded.\n7. Fry the chicken in batches for 3\u20134 minutes per side or until the chicken registers 165\u00baF. Transfer to a wire rack to allow the excess oil to drip off, and continue until the chicken is fried.\n\n*Note: As you add chicken to the oil, it can bring the temperature of the oil down. Continue to check the temperature of the oil and adjust the heat periodically to keep it around 350\u00baF.*\n\n**Finish the udon:**\n\n1. Turn the heat on the broth to medium-high. Once it bubbles, add the broccoli florets, cook until bright green and tender-crisp, and immediately turn off the heat. Taste and season the broth.\n\n**Prepare the garnish:**\n\n1. Right before serving, drizzle the reserved scallion greens with the remaining 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and the sesame seeds. Toss to coat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Thinly slice the chicken cross-wise. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and place a sliced chicken breast on top of each bowl. Add a spoonful of the scallion green garnish to each bowl, and enjoy!",

If you prefer sweeter peppers, use red or orange bell peppers, or try it with one green and one red bell pepper for a mix. If you\u2019re not a fan of ground turkey, make this with pork or beef instead.\n\nCook time: 55 minutes | Serves: 5\n\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n* 1 pound ground turkey\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and small-diced\n* 1 green bell pepper, trimmed, seeded, and small-diced\n* \u00bc cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, chopped\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, divided; plus more to taste\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* 1 teaspoon paprika\n* Crushed red pepper, to taste\n* \u00bc cup water\n* 14.5-ounce can fire-roasted crushed tomatoes\n* \u00bd cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, divided\n* 16 ounces mezzi rigatoni or another tubular pasta of choice\n* Fresh basil leaves, for serving\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Cook the turkey:**\n\n1.

Add the diced onion, bell pepper, and sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 5\u20137 minutes until the onion and peppers soften. Season with salt.\n2. Melt the butter into the pot and add the remaining Italian seasoning along with the garlic powder, paprika, and crushed red pepper to taste. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n**Simmer the rag\u00f9:**\n\n1. Return the turkey to the pot and cook for 1\u20132 minutes.\n2. Pour in the water and crushed tomatoes and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes until thickened. Taste and add more salt or Italian seasoning if needed. Stir the rag\u00f9 occasionally to prevent it from sticking.\n\n**Cook the pasta:**\n\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add plenty of salt. Cook the pasta according to package instructions. Scoop out \u00bd cup of the pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta.\n\n**Finish the rag\u00f9:**\n\n1. Taste the rag\u00f9 and season once more to your preferences. Add all but a few pinches of the Parmesan along with half the pasta cooking water. Stir until the cheese melts into the sauce.\n2. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and toss to coat for 1\u20132 minutes, adding the remaining pasta cooking water if needed. Once the pasta is glossy and well-coated, turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the pasta onto a large serving platter and sprinkle the remaining Parmesan on top.

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally: [Duck Dumplings](https:\/\/newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com\/p\/your-next-weekend-cooking-project)**\n\nI based this recipe off my duck egg roll recipe which I've made several times now, and it's always a huge hit. I made a few modifications to the filling based on ingredients I had readily available, but the filling is fantastic, with or without mushrooms.\n\nYou can also use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store - just make sure you finely chop it.\n\n**Roast duck:**\n\n* 4\u20135\u00a0pound\u00a0duck; giblets, neck, and feet reserved for another use\n* 1 orange, quartered\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Filling:**\n\n* 2-inch\u00a0piece of ginger, peeled and minced\n* 4\u00a0cloves\u00a0garlic, peeled and minced\n* 3\u00a0scallions, trimmed and minced\n* 2\u00a0Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced\n* 2\u00a0tablespoons hoisin sauce\n* 2\u00a0tablespoons thin\u00a0soy sauce\n* 1\u20132 tablespoons sweet chili sauce, optional, to taste\n* \u00bd orange, juiced\n* Salt, if needed\n\n**Dumplings:**\n\n* 24\u201328 dumpling wrappers\n* Sliced scallion greens, optional, for garnish\n* Water\n\n**Sauce:**\n\n* \u2153 cup black vinegar\n* 1\u20132 teaspoons chili oil\n* 1 teaspoon sesame oil\n* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds\n\n**Prepare the duck:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF.\n2. Line a roasting pan with foil. Place a raised rack in the pan and set aside.\n3. Pat the duck dry and season it all over with salt and pepper.\n4. Stuff the cavity with the orange wedges. Truss the legs with kitchen twine.\n\n**Roast the duck:**\n\n1. Place the duck on top of the raised rack and transfer it to the oven for 2 hours.\n2. Remove the duck from the oven. Using a sharp knife, create a few shallow slits in the skin across the breast and around the thighs. This will allow the fat to fully render. Be careful not to cut the meat too much. You just need 6\u20138 slits all over the duck, particularly around the fatty area of the legs and breasts.\n3. Return the duck to the oven for 1 hour.\n4. Remove the duck from the oven and let cool as you prepare the filling.\n\n**Prepare the filling:**\n\n1. Gather the minced ginger, garlic, scallions, and Thai chili peppers in a bowl. Add the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, orange juice, and sweet chili sauce if you like.\n\n**Shred the duck:**\n\n1. Once the duck is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones. Avoid any meat that feels very sinewy. You can keep as much of the crispy skin as you like for the dumplings, particularly the skin around the breasts, thighs, and legs. I discard the skin on the back of the duck. Reserve the carcass for stock, if you like.\n2. Place the meat and skin on a cutting board and finely dice. Transfer to the bowl of aromatics and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Your filling is finished, and you're ready to make dumplings!\n\n**Fold the dumplings:**\n\n1. First, get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation.\n2. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the dumpling wrapper.\n3. Wet the edges with water and fold the dumpling in half. Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling closed into a half-moon shape.\n4. You can crimp and pinch the edges as you seal it, but it takes practice!\n\n**Steam, pan-fry, or deep fry the dumplings:**\n\n1. To steam: fill your steamer pot with water and place the rack on top. Place a liner on top. Bring the water to a boil and arrange the dumplings on top. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and steam for 10 minutes.\n2. To pan-fry: Dip the bottoms of the dumplings into the water just to coat the bottom, then dip into a bowl of sesame seeds to evenly coat the bottom. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high. Add the dumplings, sesame seed side down, and cook without moving for 1 minute. Pour in \u00bc cup water and cover immediately. Cook for 3\u20134 minutes. Remove the lid and fry for an additional minute or so.\n3. To deep-fry: Heat a few inches of oil in a large pot until the oil reaches 330\u00baF. Add dumplings in batches and deep-fry for 3\u20134 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Make the sauce by whisking together the black vinegar, chili oil, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. Place the sauce in a small bowl in the middle of a serving platter. Arrange the dumplings around the sauce and garnish with sliced scallions. Enjoy!",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe + more photos here originally:** [**My Favorite Duck Breast Recipe**](https:\/\/newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com\/p\/my-favorite-duck-breast-recipe)\n\n**A quick tip:**\n\nTypically, you need to only boil pearl onions for 2 minutes. I go a little longer to soften them a bit more so I don't have to saut\u00e9 them quite as long since you're holding the duck. BUT! If you don't mind dirtying another skillet, feel free to start those mushrooms and onions in a separate skillet as you cook the duck.\n\nSeared duck breast:\n\n* 1 duck breast (1 pound)\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nMushrooms and pearl onions:\n\n* 8 ounces gold or white pearl onions\n* 12 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and thinly sliced\n* 2 tablespoons reserved duck fat\n* 3 sprigs thyme\n* 4 garlic cloves peeled and thinly sliced\n* 1 tablespoon freshly minced parsley, plus more for garnish\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nSweet potato puree:\n\n* 2 sweet potatoes, about 1 pound, peeled and cubed\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* \u00bd cup whole milk plus more, if needed\n* 2 tablespoons sour cream\n* 2 teaspoons garlic powder\n* 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper flakes or paprika and a pinch of crushed red pepper\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nParboil and peel the pearl onions:\n\n1. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the pearl onions (skins on) and boil for 5 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl of ice-cold water using a slotted spoon.\n2. Once the onions are cool enough to handle, carefully cut off the root end of the onion with sharp scissors. Pop the onion out from its skin. Continue on until all the onions are peeled. Discard the skins.\n\nCook the sweet potatoes:\n\n1. Dump out the water from the pot and add the sweet potatoes. Cover with fresh water and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20 minutes until fork-tender.\n2. Turn off the heat. Pour the potatoes into a colander and return the pot to the same burner. Allow the potatoes to dry off for 1 minute using the residual heat from the warm burner.\n3. Add the butter, milk, sour cream, garlic powder, and pepper flakes to the potatoes.\n4. Using an immersion blender, blend until creamy and smooth, adding more milk if needed. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder or pepper flakes. Set aside and keep warm.\n\nCook the duck:\n\n1. Pat the duck dry breast dry. Using a sharp paring knife, score the skin at an angle in \u215b-inch increments until the skin has been completely scored from edge to edge. Be careful not to pierce or cut into the flesh of the duck.\n2. Place the duck, skin-side down, into a skillet. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 7 minutes or until the fat begins to render out. Adjust the heat periodically as it cooks. You want to stay somewhere between medium and medium-low.\n3. If your duck breast is unevenly fatty (for example, the ends may have a thicker fat layer than the middle of the breast), use a small cast-iron press or skillet or a metal flipper to press that part of the duck into the skillet to encourage even browning.\n4. After 7 minutes, get the heat back to medium or just slightly above. The fat in the skillet may begin bubbling and sputtering a bit more rapidly. Check the skin and continue frying and adjusting the heat until the skin is deep golden brown and crisp. This may take another 6\u20138 minutes. Just keep adjusting the heat and peeking at the skin.\n5. Flip the duck and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until desired internal temperature is met. For medium-rare, cook the duck to about 130\u00baF at the thickest part of the breast. Note: Do not take the temperature of the duck through the skin. Pierce the flesh in order to get an accurate temperature read. I prefer to cook the duck until it reaches 135\u00baF.\n6. Transfer the duck to a plate and cover it tightly with foil. Set aside to rest as you finish the rest of the recipe.\n\nFry the mushrooms and onions:\n\n1. Drain all the duck fat into a heat-proof jar through a small sieve. Wipe out the skillet and place it on the stove over medium heat.\n2. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes until the mushrooms begin to sweat and take on a bit of color.\n3. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved duck fat, pearl onions, and thyme sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes until the pearl onions are fork-tender and golden around the edges.\n4. Stir in the minced garlic and fresh parsley and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute. Turn off the heat.\n\nTo serve:\n\n1. Right before serving, remove the foil from the duck and slice it crosswise.\n2. Spoon the sweet potatoes into a rimmed plate and pile on the mushrooms and onions. Arrange a few slices of duck on each plate. Garnish with more parsley and Aleppo pepper flakes if you like. Enjoy!",

Add 2 diced shallots and fry until they start to brown.\n\n**2.** Turn up the heat and add 400g of diced chicken thighs to the pan. Sear the meat until browned on all sides.\n\n**3.** Add 1 teaspoon each of ground cumin and ground coriander, along with 2 sliced carrots. Mix everything together and cook for 2 more minutes.\n\n**4.** Add 4 tablespoons of Thai red curry paste, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 400g of halved waxy potatoes to the pan. Pour in 400ml of coconut milk and add 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, 7 cardamom pods, 1 cinnamon stick, a pinch of nutmeg, and 2 finely sliced Kaffir lime leaves.

You can also use cashews or almonds.\n\nDon't overcook the vegetables - To retain their texture and nutrients, don't overcook the vegetables. Add them towards the end of cooking and cook just until they're tender.\n\nAdjust the seasoning - Taste the curry as you cook it and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may need to add more salt, sugar, or fish sauce to balance the flavours.",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe and more photos here originally:** [**Duck Egg Roll Recipe**](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/duck-egg-rolls\/)\n\n**Roast duck:**\n\n* 4 or 5-pound duck; giblets, neck, and feet reserved for another use\n* 2 clementines, quartered, optional\n* 2 small shallots, peeled and quartered, optional\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Filling:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n* 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded and caps small-diced\n* 1 shallot, peeled and minced\n* 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and minced\n* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 2 scallions, trimmed and minced\n* 1\u20132 Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced\n* 1\u20132 tablespoons hoisin sauce\n* 2 teaspoons sweet chili sauce or teriyaki sauce\n* 1 tablespoon soy sauce\n* 1 teaspoon Chinese Five Spice, plus more to taste\n* 1\/4 teaspoon white pepper\n* Salt, if needed\n\n**Egg rolls:**\n\n* Vegetable oil\n* 10\u201312 egg roll wrappers\n* Thinly sliced scallions\n\n**Prepare the duck:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF.\n2. Line a roasting pan with foil. Place a raised rack in the pan and set aside.\n3. Pat the duck dry and season it all over with salt and pepper.\n4. Stuff the cavity with quartered clementines and shallots. Using kitchen twine, tie the legs together.\n\n**Roast the duck:**\n\n1. Place the duck on top of the raised rack and transfer it to the oven for 2 hours.\n2. Remove the duck from the oven. Using a sharp knife, create a few shallow slits in the skin across the breast and around the thighs. This will allow the fat to fully render. Be careful not to cut the meat too much. You just need 6\u20138 slits all over the duck, particularly around the fatty area of the legs and breasts.\n3. Return the duck to the oven for 1 hour.\n4. Remove the duck from the oven and let cool as you prepare the filling.\n\n**Cook the filling:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, minced shallot, ginger, garlic, scallions, and minced Thai chili peppers. Cook for 6\u20137 minutes, turning occasionally until the mushrooms are golden brown. Turn off the heat and transfer to a large bowl.\n\n**Prepare the filling:**\n\n1. To the bowl of aromatics, add the hoisin sauce, sweet chili sauce, soy sauce, Chinese Five Spice, and white pepper. Toss to combine. Set aside.\n\n**Shred the duck:**\n\n1. Once the duck is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones. Avoid any meat that feels very sinewy. You can keep as much of the skin as you like for the egg rolls, particularly the skin around the breasts, thighs, and legs. I discard the skin on the back of the duck. Reserve the carcass for stock, if you like.\n2. Place the meat and skin on a cutting board and finely dice. Transfer to the bowl of aromatics and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.\n\n**Heat the oil:**\n\n1. Heat 2\u20133 inches of oil in a wide pot until it reaches 325\u00baF.\n\n**Roll the egg rolls:**\n\n1. First, get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation.\n2. Place the egg roll wrapper on a plate and rotate it so that it\u2019s a diamond.\n3. Place two tablespoons or so of filling in the middle of the wrapper.\n4. Lift up the bottom corner of the diamond (the corner closest to you) and fold it over the filling. Use your fingers to pinch the wrapper over the filling tightly.\n5. Fold the left and right corners over the filling. The wrapper will look like an envelope now.\n6. Roll the mixture toward the top corner one rotation. You should have a small triangle sticking out at the top.\n7. Dip your fingers into the water and wet the edges of the remaining corner (imagine you\u2019re sealing an envelope!). Roll the filling one more rotation to seal the egg roll. Dip your fingers back into the water and brush the corner once more to completely seal the egg roll.\n8. Continue on until all the egg rolls are rolled.\\*\n\n**Fry the egg rolls:**\n\n1. Once the oil is hot, begin frying the egg rolls in batches for 2\u20134 minutes or until the wrapper is golden brown and crispy. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Place the egg rolls on a serving platter with thinly sliced scallions. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy!\n\n*Note: If you don\u2019t think you can eat all of them in one sitting, place as many un-fried egg rolls as you\u2019d like to freeze on a baking sheet. Transfer to the freezer for 4 hours. Remove from the freezer and place in a freezer bag. Return to the freezer. They will keep for up to 6 months and can be baked, deep-fried, or air-fried whenever you want them!*",

Add the diced onion and peppers and cook, occasionally stirring, for 5\u20137 minutes. Season lightly with salt.\n2. Melt the butter into the onion and peppers. Once bubbly, add the chili powder, cumin, cayenne powder, and paprika. Toss to coat and sizzle the spices in the butter for about 1 minute.\n3. Pour in the reserved broth and shredded chicken. Next, pour in the diced tomatoes, black beans, and enchilada sauce cans. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Taste and season to your preferences.\n\n**Finish the soup:**\n\n1. Stir in the softened cream cheese if using. Continue cooking until it\u2019s completely melted into the broth.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with your favorite toppings. Enjoy!",

Trim some of the fat off the chicken thighs. If you prefer a juicier fried chicken you can leave it on. Cut the chicken thighs into 1-inch pieces.\n2. **Marinade.** In a medium bowl combine the chicken thigh pieces, five spice, light soy sauce, minced garlic, white pepper, black pepper, salt, sesame oil, sugar, egg white and Shaoxing cooking wine. Mix until all the chicken thigh pieces are well coated. Let it marinate for at least 1 hour. Overnight is recommended so the flavor is absorbed into the meat.\n3. **Combine the seasoning powder.** Combine the five-spice, salt, white pepper and Sichuan peppercorns. Set aside.\n4. **Coat the chicken thighs.** Combine the cornstarch and potato or tapioca starch on a shallow plate. Dredge the marinaded chicken thighs. Be generous with coating the pieces so you can get an extra crispy piece when fried.\n5. **Heat the oil.** Take a pan and add the oil and bring it to 350 Degrees F. I leave it at medium-high heat.\n6. **Deep fry.** In small batches add the pieces slowly without splashing the oil. Do not overcrowd or your chicken will not crisp up resulting in limp and super oily popcorn chicken. Fry for 4-5 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Removed with a slotted spoon and let the oil drip. Either use a paper towel or a rack to let it cool. Repeat this 2-3 times.\n7. **Double fry (Optional Step).** Once all the chicken pieces have been deep fry. Double fry to get a crispier chicken. Toss the chicken in the batch and deep fry for 2 minutes. Do not overcook otherwise it may burn.\n8. **Deep fry Thai Basil.** Take the basil and toss it into the hot oil. Deep fry for 15-20 seconds or until they are crispy and still green. Remove with a slotted spoon and place them on top of a paper towel to absorb most of the oil.\n9. **Coat with seasoning powder.** Toss the fried popcorn chicken in a large bowl and coat them with the seasoning powder. Add as much or as little of the seasoning mix.\n10. **Plate and top with fried Thai basil.** Plate the fried chicken and top it with the fried thai basil. Enjoy!",

This version serves it up over tortellini tossed in extra sauce.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast\n* 16-20 oz fresh or frozen cheese tortellini\n* 2 cups half-and-half, or 1 cup cream + 1 cup whole milk\n* 1 \u00bd tsp chicken better than bouillon, or chicken bouillon cubes\n* \u2153 cup sun dried tomatoes, drained and chopped fine\n* \u00bd cup freshly grated parmesan cheese\n* 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, or sub basil or parsley\n* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic\n* \u00bc cup all-purpose flour\n* \u00bd tsp crushed red pepper flakes (add more to make it spicy, or omit if very sensitive to spice)\n* \u00bd tsp dried oregano\n* olive oil\n* garlic powder\n* freshly cracked black pepper\n* salt\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Fillet the chicken breast(s) and pound to a thin, even thickness. Season all over with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Pour flour onto a shallow plate and dredge the chicken in it, shaking off any excess.\n2. Warm 2 tbsp olive oil over medium high heat, sear breasts for about 3 mins per side, until golden, then remove to a cutting board. Slice into the largest piece to ensure it\u2019s cooked through, then tent with foil to keep warm. Do not wipe the pan clean. Turn off the heat to allow the pan to cool slightly.\n3. Meanwhile, begin boiling a large pot of salted water. Cook the tortellini per package instructions while preparing the rest of the meal. Drain and cover to keep warm until needed. (Most cook times are short, so wait until the sauce is almost done)\n4. In the pan you cooked the chicken, cook the garlic and red pepper flakes over medium heat until fragrant (about 1 minute), add more oil if needed.  Next, add the half-and-half and reduce heat to medium low. Add the bouillon and oregano, mix well and scrape any browned bits into the sauce. Once simmering, add the parmesan (reserving a little for garnish) and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is the consistency of thick cream, about 10 minutes.\n5. After simmering, add the chopped sun dried tomatoes and mix well. Add the chicken back to the pan and spoon sauce over it until it\u2019s coated. Warm it in the pan for 1-2 minutes, then remove to a cutting board and cut into bite sized pieces.\n6. Toss the tortellini in the sauce, then plate into serving dishes. Top with the chicken, then garnish with the reserved parmesan and fresh thyme.\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear how it went and any feedback you have in the comments section!**",

I made this recipe with him in mind :)\n\n* Prep Time: 20 minutes\n* Cook Time: 35 minutes\n* Inactive time: 1 hour\n* Total Time: 1 hour 50 minutes\n* Servings: 6\n* Calories: 451kcal\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 3 carrots, peeled and diced\n* 8 ounces button mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced\n* 3 tablespoons butter\n* 6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 1 teaspoon dry thyme\n* 1 teaspoon dry oregano\n* \u00bd teaspoon crushed red pepper\n* 10-ounce jar roasted red peppers, drained and sliced\n* 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n* \u00bd cup red wine\n* 14.5- ounce can cherry or whole peeled tomatoes\n* 28- ounce can crushed tomatoes\n* \u00bd cup chicken stock or water\n* Pinch of sugar, optional\n* 6- ounce jar pitted Castelvetrano olives, drained and torn in half\n* 8-ounce ball fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced into rounds\n* Extra virgin olive oil\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* For serving:\n* Cooked pappardelle pasta\n* Minced parsley\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**Fry the chicken:**\n\n1. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Heat the 1 tablespoon of neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the chicken thighs, in batches if needed, skin-side down. Cook without moving for 5 minutes or until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the bottom of the pot. Flip and cook for 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Keep the pot on medium-high heat.\n\n**Cook the aromatics:**\n\n1. Add the diced onion, carrots, and sliced mushrooms to the pot. Cook, stirring regularly, for 8\u201310 minutes. Season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Melt the butter into the pot and add the garlic, dry thyme, dry oregano, and crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the red bell peppers and cook for 1 minute.\n\n**Brown the tomato paste:**\n\n1. Add the tomato paste to the pot. Cook, stirring and mashing the paste into the pot, for 3\u20134 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium as needed to prevent it from burning. The paste will sizzle, deepen in color, and stick to the bottom of the pot.\n2. Pour the wine into the pot and bring it to a boil. Stir to lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot.\n\n**Simmer the sauce:**\n\n1. Add both cans of tomatoes along with the chicken stock or water. Add a pinch of sugar if you like. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, taste the sauce, and add a pinch of salt and pepper if needed. Add the chicken to the pot, spooning the sauce so that it completely covers the chicken.\n2. Cover the pot and simmer on low heat for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally to ensure that the sauce isn't sticking.\n3. After 30 minutes, remove the lid and add the torn olives, stirring them into the sauce. Cover and simmer for an additional 10\u201320 minutes.\n\n**Finish the chicken cacciatore:**\n\n1. Turn on the broiler. Remove the lid from the pot. Arrange the sliced mozzarella on top and drizzle with a teaspoon or two of extra virgin olive oil. Transfer to the broiler for 2\u20134 minutes or until the cheese is browned and bubbly. Turn off the broiler and remove the pot from the oven.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1.

This method uses baking soda. This process is optional but recommended. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 lbs chicken breast\r\n* 3 cups broccoli florets\r\n* 1 8oz can of water chestnuts, drained and rinsed (optional)\r\n* 3 green onions, greens sliced thin\r\n* 2 tsp baking soda\r\n* 1 tbsp olive oil\r\n* salt\r\n* fresh cracked black pepper\r\n\n*For Sauce:*\r\n\n* \u00bd cup chicken broth, can sub water\r\n* 2 tbsp mirin, Japanese sweet cooking wine\r\n* 2 tbsp soy sauce\r\n* 2 tbsp oyster sauce\r\n* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil\r\n* 2 tbsp cornstarch\r\n* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Slice the chicken breast into \\~\u00bc\u201d thick slices. Arrange the sliced chicken on a cutting board or plate so it\u2019s laying flat. Dust with 1 tsp of baking soda, then flip all the pieces and dust with the other 1 tsp of baking soda. Let sit for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, rinse the baking soda off of the chicken with water then thoroughly pat dry (This is what tenderizes the chicken and gives it the unique texture). Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper.\r\n2. While waiting on the chicken, mix together the chicken stock and cornstarch in small bowl, then add in the other sauce ingredients and mix well. The oyster sauce may not fully incorporate, that\u2019s okay it will in the pan.\r\n3. Once the chicken is prepared, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and try to arrange it such that the pieces lay flat in the pan. Cook until golden on one side (2-3 minutes), then mix the chicken around in the pan and cook until cooked through (another \\~90 seconds).\r\n4. Push the chicken to the sides of the pan and add the broccoli to the center. Cook for about one minute, then add the water chestnuts and cook for another minute. Add more oil to the pan if needed.\r\n5. Next, lower the heat slightly and add the sauce. Cook everything together for another \\~2 minutes until the sauce has reduced and evenly coated everything. Remove from heat and add in the chopped green onion, serve immediately over a bed of white rice.\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear how it goes (plus any feedback\/modifications) in the comment section!**",

        "recipe_comment":"# Dry Rub BBQ Chicken Breast\n\nThis recipe is perfect for meal prepping, I recommend making a large batch to use throughout the week or freeze for later. Recommend prep is in a smoker, but it also works great in the oven.\n\nMakes: 20 6oz portions (315 cal per serving)\n\nOriginal recipe: [https:\/\/craftycookbook.com\/dry-rub-bbq-chicken-breast\/](https:\/\/craftycookbook.com\/dry-rub-bbq-chicken-breast\/)\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 10 lbs large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or make a smaller batch)\n\n*For dry rub:*\n\n* \u00bd cup dark brown sugar\n* \u00bc cup kosher salt\n* 2 tbsp garlic powder\n* 1 tbsp black pepper\n* 1 tbsp onion powder\n* 1 tbsp smoked paprika\n* 1 tbsp chili powder, add more for extra spice\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Begin preheating a smoker or the oven to 250\u00b0 F. If preparing in the oven, line a baking sheet with foil then place a wire rack on it, lightly spray with oil (will need 2X if cooking 10 lbs of chicken).\n2. Mix together all of the dry rub ingredients and set aside.\n3. Trim any excess fat off the chicken breasts, then dust them with the dry rub. Use clean hands to rub the dry rub into the meat, flip and repeat with the other side, so the chicken is fully coated. The dry rub should stick to the meat without needing any additional binders.\n4. Place the chicken breast in the smoker or oven and cook until the chicken reaches an internal temp of 165\u00b0 F in the thickest portion. Use a leave-in meat thermometer to monitor the temperature, if you have one. For large breasts this should take 1 to 1.5 hours in the oven, or 1 to 2 hours in a smoker. If you don\u2019t have a meat thermometer available, slice into one of the breasts to make sure it\u2019s cooked through.\n5. Once the chicken is cooked through, cut the breasts into small cubes on a large cutting board then gently shred the meat. The breasts should have a tough outer skin and tender, juicy center.\n\n*To Freeze*\n\n* Separate into the portions you expect to use at a time (I use 10-12 oz per meal for two adults). Seal these portions in a freezer-safe zip bag with the air pressed out, or vacuum seal if you\u2019re able to. Place the packets in the freezer until ready to use.\n\n*To Reheat*\n\n* Place the sealed bag of frozen chicken in a bowl of cool water, let it sit until it's mostly defrosted, about 20 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a microwave safe container and warm in the microwave, tossing every 30 seconds, until heated through.\n\n*To Use*\n\n* There are endless possibilities for what you can add this chicken to! Here are my favorite uses: loaded grilled cheese sandwiches, quesadillas, on pizza, on pasta, on salads, and in soup!\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear how it went in the comments section!**",

Once the sauce is ready, remove from heat and reserve about 2 tbsp (for topping the chicken). Toss the pasta in the remainder of the sauce. Plate the pasta, and top with the chicken sliced into bite sized pieces. Top the chicken with the remaining sauce and garnish the whole dish with the cilantro.\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear how went + any feedback or modifications in the comment section!**",

        "recipe_comment":"# Spicy Feta Chicken with Lemon Rice\n\nTender shredded chicken coated in incredibly flavorful spicy feta sauce, paired with tangy lemon rice. (Note, this is not authentic Greek lemon rice)\n\nTime: 40 mins\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast\n* \u2154 cup chicken stock\n* olive oil\n* salt\n* fresh cracked black pepper\n* red pepper flakes, optional, for topping\n* \\~1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves, optional, for topping\n\n*For Feta Sauce:*\n\n* 4 oz feta\n* 1 small shallot, chopped\n* \u00bc cup roasted red bell peppers, chopped (I use jarred peppers)\n* \u00bd tbsp freshly minced garlic\n* \u00bd tbsp red wine vinegar\n* 1 tbsp olive oil\n* 3 tbsp chicken stock or water\n* \u00bc tsp cayenne powder + more to taste\n* \u215b tsp salt\n* \u215b tsp black pepper\n\n*For Lemon Rice:*\n\n* 2 cups jasmine rice\n* 3 cups chicken stock\n* 2 large lemons zested and juiced\n* 2 tbsp butter\n* salt to taste\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instructions - Spicy Feta Chicken**\n\n1. Trim any excess fat and gently pound the chicken breast(s) to an even thickness. Season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Warm a drizzle of olive oil over medium-high heat in a pan that has a lid. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken and cook for about 3 minutes per side until golden. Add the \u2154 cup chicken stock to the pan and close with the lid. Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for another \\~10 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked through.\n3. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. Combine the spicy feta sauce ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth, scraping down the sides as needed. Taste and add more cayenne to make it as spicy as you\u2019d like (if you are very sensitive to spice, start with \u215b tsp rather than \u00bc tsp cayenne or omit completely).\n4. When the chicken is ready, allow it to rest for a few minutes then shred it (I use two forks to shred chicken breast). Toss the chicken in the sauce until its fully coated, you may not want to use all the sauce so add a little at a time.\n5. Optionally, top with red pepper flakes and\/or fresh thyme when serving.\n\n**Instructions - Lemon Rice**\n\n1. Thoroughly rinse the rice until the water runs clear (even if the rice says \u201cpre-washed\u201d). In a medium stockpot combine the rice, chicken stock, and half of the lemon juice.\n2. Close the pot with a lid and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes, then reduce the heat to low so the rice is simmering and cook until the water is all gone, about 10 minutes. Set heat to low to keep warm until ready to serve.\n3. Before serving, add the lemon zest, the rest of the lemon juice, butter, and a dash of salt. Mix well, then serve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you make this recipe, I'd love to hear how it goes in the comments!",

Let stand for 5 minutes.\n* Place a large pot on the stove over medium-high heat. Add the butter. Once melted, add the diced onion and cook until translucent. Add the rinsed rice and cook 1\u20132 minutes. Pour the saffron-water mixture on top and then add the remaining water. Season it with salt and then bring to a low boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes or until the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and let the rice rest for 5\u201310 minutes.\n\n#### Prepare the zucchini-cucumber salad:\n\n* Add the diced zucchini, cucumber, and shallot to a bowl. Add extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, and dry dill. Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss to combine. Set aside.\n\n#### Prepare the hummus sauce:\n\n* Whisk together the hummus, lemon juice, and chili flakes until smooth. Taste and add salt if needed. Add a few splashes of water until the hummus reaches drizzling consistency. Set aside.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Divide the rice between bowls. Pile the meatballs on top and add a spoonful of salad to each bowl. Serve with a spoonful of the hummus sauce and toasted pita, if you like.

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally: [Creamy Chicken Pasta Recipe](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/creamy-chicken-pasta-recipe\/)**\n\nThis creamy chicken pasta recipe is a rich, comforting creamy chicken pasta with vegetables like Brussels sprouts and roasted red bell peppers.\n\nThis creamy chicken pasta recipe can be made in a few different ways:\n\n* Raw split chicken breasts that you turn into a homemade chicken stock\n* Leftover shredded chicken from a homemade or store-bought roasted chicken\n* Raw, boneless chicken that you simply chop up and saut\u00e9 until cooked through before starting the sauce\n\nFor the recipe below, I used raw split chicken breasts that I turned into very simple chicken stock. However, this does add more time to the recipe. If you\u2019re in a pinch and you have leftover shredded chicken already, you can skip the steps for making the stock and move right into the sauce preparation.\n\n**What you need:**\n\nFor this recipe, you\u2019ll primarily need chicken, pasta, vegetables, and heavy cream. Take a look at some of my substitution suggestions so you can modify this dish any way you like:\n\n* **Chicken:** Omit for vegetarian. You could also use shrimp but you would skip baking the dish to avoid overcooking them.\n* **Brussels sprouts:** Use your favorite vegetables in this meal! Try it with zucchini, broccoli or broccolini, cauliflower florets, eggplant, or use spinach.\n* **Roasted red bell peppers:** Chopped sun-dried tomatoes\n\nPrep Time: 15 minutes\n\nCook Time: 30 minutes\n\nInactive Time: 1 hour\n\nTotal Time: 1 hour 45 minutes \n\nServings: 6 \n\nCalories: 762kcal\n\n### Equipment\n\n* Large pot\n* Baking sheet\n* Wide ovenproof pot\n* Sieve\n* Tongs\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Chicken stock (optional):\n\n* 1 pound bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts\n* 1 yellow onion quartered, paper left on\n* 1 head of garlic halved, paper left on\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n#### Creamy chicken pasta:\n\n* 16 ounces pasta of your choice like strozzapreti, rigatoni, penne, rotini, or fusilli\n* 2 tablespoons neutral oil\n* 2 red bell peppers trimmed, seeded, and quartered\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 1 pound Brussels sprouts halved\n* 4 tablespoons butter\n* 1 teaspoon dry thyme\n* \u00bd teaspoon crushed red pepper plus more if desired\n* \u2153 cup all-purpose flour\n* 1\u00bd cups homemade chicken stock from above or use store-bought stock\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Freshly minced parsley optional, for garnish\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Prepare the stock:\n\n* Cover split chicken breasts with water and season liberally with salt. Add the quartered onion and halved head of garlic. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 30\u201340 minutes until the chicken is cooked through. Skim off the foam that floats to the top as the chicken cooks.\n* Use tongs to transfer the chicken to a plate and let it cool. Bring the stock back to a boil and boil for 15 minutes until significantly reduced. Strain through a sieve into a large bowl and set aside. You will need 1\u00bd cups stock for the recipe, and any extra stock can be saved for another use.\n* Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred it with your fingers, two forks, or dice it up. Discard the skin and bones.\n* Wipe out the pot used for the stock and fill it back up with salted water and return it to the stovetop. You'll use it for the pasta later on.\n\n#### Broil the red bell peppers:\n\n* While the stock cooks, prepare the red bell peppers. Arrange the prepared peppers on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Place under a broiler and cook for 7\u20138 minutes until blackened all over. Keep an eye on them, so they don't burn to a crisp!\n* Immediately transfer the peppers to a Tupperware dish with a lid or a gallon freezer bag. The trapped steam will help the skins come off easily. Peel the peppers and roughly chop and set aside.\n* Turn the broiler off and turn the oven's heat to 400\u00baF.\n\n#### Cook the pasta:\n\n* Bring the pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until 2 minutes under al dente. Drain and set aside.\n\n#### Cook the vegetables:\n\n* In a wide, oven-proof pot, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat. Cook the onion until softened\u2013about 7\u201310 minutes\u2013and then turn the heat to high. Add the Brussels sprouts and cook for 6 minutes until well-charred. Add the chopped red peppers and cook for 2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl.\n\n#### Prepare the sauce:\n\n* Melt the butter in the pot over medium heat. Once bubbly, add dry thyme and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add flour to the butter and cook for 2\u20133 minutes until lightly golden. Slowly whisk in the reserved chicken stock. Bring to a low boil and then reduce heat and continue whisking until completely smooth.\n* Stir in the heavy cream and whisk until smooth. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and more crushed red pepper if you like. Turn off the heat.\n\n#### Bake the pasta:\n\n* To the sauce, add the cooked chicken, cooked pasta, and the reserved vegetables and toss to coat and evenly distribute the ingredients. Sprinkle the parmesan cheese on top and transfer to the oven for 10\u201315 minutes or until the Brussels sprouts are fork-tender and the cheese is melted. If you like, broil for 2\u20133 minutes to char the top of the pasta.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Garnish the pasta with fresh minced parsley and serve immediately.

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally: [Chicken Barley Soup Recipe](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/chicken-barley-soup-recipe\/)**\n\n\n**Want to make some substitutions? Here\u2019s my handy guide:**\n\n* **Raw chicken:** In a pinch for time? Use a storebought rotisserie chicken and storebought stock.\n* **Carrots, celery, and onions:** Use any combination of aromatics. If you don\u2019t have celery, use more carrots! You can even add lots of freshly minced garlic or even sliced fennel.\n* **Mushrooms:** You can omit them or swap with something else you have in your crisper. Try adding a soup green at the end (like escarole, spinach, or arugula) or you can add some frozen veggies at the end like green beans, corn, or peas!\n* **Barley:** Use wild rice, farro, farfalle, egg noodles, or pearl couscous. Cooking time will vary!\n\n**Chicken Barley Soup Recipe**\n\nThis chicken barley soup recipe is comforting and warming with rich homemade chicken stock, lots of aromatics, and mushrooms.\n\nPrep Time: 20 minutes\n\nCook Time: 20 minutes\n\nInactive Time: 4 hours 45 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 5 hours 25 minutes\n\nServings: 8\n\nCalories: 376kcal\n\n## Equipment\n\n* Large stockpot\n* Sieve\n\n## Ingredients\n\n## Chicken stock:\n\n* 3- pound whole chicken giblets removed and discarded\n* 2 chicken leg quarters optional\n* 5 ribs celery with leaves roughly chopped\n* 3 carrots scrubbed and cut into thirds\n* 1 onion with paper quartered\n* 2 dry bay leaves\n* 1 bunch parsley torn or cut in half\n* Salt and pepper\n* Water\n\n## Chicken barley soup:\n\n* 1 tablespoon oil for saut\u00e9ing\n* 7 ounces mushrooms of choice like beech, cremini, or shiitake, sliced or torn depending on variety\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 4 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and diced\n* 5 carrots trimmed, peeled, and diced\n* 1 teaspoon dry thyme\n* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* 1 cup pearl barley\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Fresh minced parsley optional, for serving\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Prepare the chicken stock:\n\n* Place the chicken in a big stockpot with celery, carrots, onion, bay leaves, and parsley. Cover with water and season liberally with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for 3\u20134 hours. Skim off any scum or foam that rises to the top. Let the pot cool and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.\n\n## Finish the chicken stock:\n\n* The next day, remove the chicken from the broth and transfer it to a bowl. Strain the stock through a sieve into a big bowl and discard the solids. Pick the chicken from the bones and discard the skin and carcass. Wipe out the stockpot and return it to the stovetop.\n\n## Prepare the chicken barley soup:\n\n* Once your stock is ready to go, prepare the soup. Heat the neutral oil in the stockpot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook for 8\u201310 minutes. Add the onions, carrots, and celery and cook, stirring often, for an additional 8\u201310 minutes.\n* Add the dry thyme, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the reserved stock and chicken meat. Add the barley and then bring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 30\u201345 minutes. If needed, supplement the soup with a bit of water or storebought stock, but you likely won\u2019t need it!\n\n## Finish the soup:\n\n* Once the barley is tender, turn off the heat, taste the soup, and season to your preferences.\n\n## To serve:\n\n* Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with more freshly minced parsley, if you like.

It brings many tasty summer ingredients together, such as ripe tomatoes, olives, plenty of herbs and garlic, of course.\n\nEnjoy the recipe and [**United Cuisines on YouTube!**](https:\/\/youtu.be\/zxbcuoEvOew)\n\n*INGREDIENTS*\n\n* chicken, preferably thighs \\[10 oz \/ 300 g per person\\]\n* olive oil \\[2 tbsp \/ 25 ml\\]\n* butter \\[1 tbsp \/ 10 g\\]\n* 1 small onion \/ shallot\n* 3 garlic cloves\n* salty anchovies \\[2-3 filets\\]\n* dry white wine \\[1\/3 cup \/ 80 ml\\]\n* crushed, ripe tomatoes \\[10 oz \/ 300 g\\]\n* chicken stock \\[1\/2 cup \/ 120 ml\\]\n* black olives \\[1 oz \/ 30 g\\]\n* 1 tsp of Herbes de Provence \\[alternatively 1\/2 tsp of thyme and rosemary each\\]\n* flat Italian parsley \\[a handful\\]\n\n*DIRECTIONS*\n\n1. Cube the onion, as well as an optional red pepper, or any other vegetable, that you'd like in your summer dish. Cut pitted olives into 3-4 slices and chop up the parsley\n2. Wash and dab the chicken dry, before seasoning with salt\n3. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and melt one tablespoon of butter in a pan and saut\u00e9 the chicken over medium heat for 3-4 minutes from each side till nicely browned\n4. Once your chicken is browned, not fully cooked yet, set aside on a plate. Reduce the heat to medium-low and use the same pan and oil to saut\u00e9 your onion and pepper for a few minutes till tender\n5. Crush in 3 garlic cloves and add 2 salty anchovies. Mix well and fry for 30-60 seconds, until the garlic turns fragrant, before deglazing with dry white wine\n6. Give the alcohol a few minutes to evaporate and when the wine reduced almost in half, add the chicken stock, crushed tomatoes, as well as black olives. Lastly, mix in the Herbes de Provence\n7. Bring to a slight a boil, reduce the heat to low and, before seasoning with salt and pepper, taste the sauce, as olives and anchovies are very salty\n8. Return the chicken pieces into the pan, cover with a lid and let cook in the sauce for 20 minutes. Turn upside down after 10 minutes\n9. Turn off the heat, mix in half of the chopped parsley and sprinkle the remainder on each serving\n10.

Blend all the wet ingredients by using a food processor, add just enough oil to make a smooth paste.\n3. Score the chicken and rub it with wet and dry ingredients. For the best result do it one day before cooking.\n4. Grill the chicken breasts until internal temperature reaches 72C (162F). For chicken legs 82C (180F) plus resting time of minimum of 15 minutes.\n5. Serve chicken with fries and Peri-Peri sauce. Enjoy!\n\n**Insight:**\n\n\\- Rest meat covered with aluminium foil and placed in the oven set for 70C (160F). This helps to preserve temperature, keeps the meat juicy and when it comes to chicken legs, the meat will fall off the bone.\n\nBlog post: https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/peri-peri-chicken-rub",

Cut into the fatty parts around where the legs meet the body and between the wings and the body. You just want to make enough slits around the fatty part of the duck skin so that the fat renders out.\n\n#### Stuff the Duck:\n\n* Peel the shallots and quarter. Quarter 4 of the clementines. Stuff the duck with the clementines and shallots and tie the legs together. Season the duck liberally with salt and pepper.\n\n#### Roast the Duck:\n\n* Line a baking sheet with foil and place a raised roasting rack on the foil. Place the duck on top and transfer to the oven, breast-side up, for 1 hour.\n* Flip the duck and cook, breast-side down, for 1 more hour.\n* Remove the duck from the oven. At this point, you can drain off the duck fat and reserve it for another use.\n* Roast the duck, breast-side up for 40 minutes more.\n\n#### Prepare the Glaze:\n\n* In a saucepan, combine the juice of the remaining 4 clementines, maple syrup, 4 star anise pods, and 1 teaspoon dijon mustard. Bring to a boil and whisk until smooth. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat.\n* Remove the duck from the oven and brush half the glaze over the duck. Return to the oven for 20 more minutes.\n* Brush the duck with the remaining glaze and bake for 10 minutes. Turn on the broiler and broil for 4-5 minutes until the skin darkens on top, being careful not to burn the sugars in the glaze.\n* *Note: You can reserve a few teaspoons of the sauce and spoon it over the duck at service.*\n\n#### To Serve:\n\n* Remove from oven and serve!

Pop the garlic from the paper and transfer to a small bowl.\n* At this point, you may refrigerate the broth, chicken, and cooked garlic for 4-8 hours and remove the congealed fat from the top of the broth. Or you can continue on with the recipe as-is and simply remove any congealed chicken fat from the soup the next day.\n\n#### Saut\u00e9 the soup aromatics:\n\n* Heat 1 tablespoon oil in the stockpot over medium heat. Add the diced onion, celery, and carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, for at least 10 minutes until they begin to soften and char.

Once bubbly, add the reserved, cooked garlic and mash it into the aromatics until a smooth paste forms.\n\n#### Simmer the soup:\n\n* Add the shredded chicken to the pot along with the strained broth. Add an additional 3\u20134 cups water or enough to cover the soup ingredients by 2 inches. Simmer for an additional 20\u201330 minutes or until the carrots are tender. *Note: you may need to add more water, as necessary, depending on how salty and reduced your broth became from the hard simmer. Just taste and add \u00bd cup of water at a time as necessary!*\n\n#### Cook the noodles:\n\n* Taste the broth and adjust the seasonings as necessary. Bring to a boil. Add the noodles and cook for 8\u201312 minutes or until just al dente.\n\n#### Finish the chicken noodle soup:\n\n* Once the noodles are tender, reduce heat and add the white pepper, dill, parsley, and lemon juice. Cook an additional 5 minutes. Once the herbs are bright green and the noodles are tender, turn off the heat.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with crusty bread.

The other 5 will be used while cooking the curry. Grate or pound 10 garlic cloves along with ginger. Slice thinly, the remaining 5 garlic cloves  \n   \nIf you are using chicken drumsticks, make sure to score the meat portion a couple of times.   \nIn a bowl add the chicken pieces along with yogurt, pounded garlic, \u00bd teaspoon turmeric and 1 teaspoon salt. Give it a mix nicely to coat all the chicken pieces. Keep it aside for minimum 4 hrs or overnight for maximum flavor blend.   \nWhen you are ready to prepare the chicken curry, place a heavy bottom nonstick pan on the stove at medium heat. Pour the oil along with the sliced garlic, chopped green chili and chopped ginger. As the oil heats up, the garlic will start to sizzle and slowly turn golden brown. Take out some garlic chips to add later in garnish.   \nTo the wok add the sliced onion. Sprinkle the rest of the salt, sugar and turmeric along with the spices (cumin powder, coriander powder and chili powder). Stir and cook the onion for 3 minutes, or until it\u2019s golden brown.   \nThen add the marinated chicken and stir it to incorporate everything. If you are using boneless chicken cubes, it will take 15minutes to cook the chicken. If you use chicken with bones in, then it will take about 20 minutes.   \nAfter 10 minutes of cooking the chicken, it will start to release water. Now depending on how much gravy you want, add water and let it continue cooking.   \nOnce the chicken is cooked, taste for salt and add any if needed.   \nFinally sprinkle finely chopped cilantro leaves, garam masala powder and give it a mix.",

Make your slaw first and let it sit in the fridge for two hours. Follow my Korean coleslaw recipe.\n2. Slice chicken thigh into bite-sized pieces. Marinade in rice wine, salt, pepper, garlic, and ginger for 30 minutes.\n3. In a pan, mix ingredients for the sauce on low-medium heat. Allow it to bubble and simmer until thick, keep stirring during the process. This should take about 4-5 minutes. Turn off the heat and let sit on the side.\n4. Coat chicken with corn starch. However, only coat what you will fry immediately. If you let the chicken sit too long in the starch, it will become a sludge.\n5. In a shallow pot, add in a neutral flavored oil. Ensure the oil is hot (350\u00b0 F) before you drop in your chicken. Cook in separate batches. Don't crowd the chicken as it will cause the temperature to drop too quickly and you won't get a nice brown outer layer. Fry each batch for 3 minutes.\n6. After each batch, remove chicken with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to absorb some of the oil.\n7. Once all the chicken has been fried a first time, put all the chicken back in for a second fry. No need to do this in batches. Fry for about 2 minutes.\n8. Heat up the sweet and spicy sauce and add in the fried chicken. Mix well so each piece is evenly coated.\n9. Heat up tortillas on a griddle of a pan until softened. Add chicken and top with coleslaw, kimchi, and white sesame seeds (optional). For some creaminess, use a light drizzle of mayo (optional).",

Enjoy cooking!\r  \n\r  \nThe secret of the best Chicken Tandoori is the meat quality and marinating time.\r  \n\r  \nThe longer marinating period the better. It gives the meat enough time to absorb all those beautiful flavours!\r  \n\r  \nRemember to always pick the meat from suppliers that do respect animal welfare, if you cannot afford it try to eat less meat but better sourced.\r  \n\r  \nMaking cuts in the meat helps the marinade to penetrate deeper, thus giving a better result.\r  \n\r  \nServes 3 hungry heads\r  \n\r  \n\n\n**Ingredients for Chicken Tandoori:**\r  \n\r  \n3 good quality chicken legs\r  \n\r  \n3 tbsp of natural yoghurt\r  \n\r  \n1\/2tsp of salt\r  \n\r  \nhalf lemon juice and zest\r  \n\r  \n3tsp of garlic and ginger paste\r  \n\r  \n2tbsp of Kashmiri mild chilli powder (if you are not a big fan of spicy food substitute with 2tbsp of paprika)\r  \n\r  \n1tsp of turmeric\r  \n\r  \n1\/2tsp ground coriander\r  \n\r  \n1tbsp oil\r  \n\r  \n\n\n**Instructions for Chicken Tandoori:**\r  \n\r  \n1.Prepare the chicken by removing the skin and separating the drumstick from the thigh. Next, make three deep cuts on each side of the pieces (This helps marinate to penetrate deeper)\r  \n\r  \n2.Place the chicken in the bowl and rub with 1\/2 lemon juice and 1\/2tsp of salt.\r  \n\r  \n3.Mix remaining marinade ingredients and rub in the meat.\r  \n\r  \n4.Place in the fridge for 24 hours (2 hours minimum if you in the rush)\r  \n\r  \n5.To cook the chicken, preheat the oven to a 220C fan (428F) setting and place the meat on a flat tray with some baking paper. Once the oven is hot, roast the chicken for 30 minutes on one side, flip to another, and continue on the grill setting for another 10-15 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n6.Rest under foil for 5 minutes before serving.\r  \n\r  \n\n\n**Ingredients for Vegetable Biryani:**\r  \n\r  \n300g (10.6oz) of extra long basmati rice\r  \n\r  \n2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil\r  \n\r  \n1 small cinnamon stick\r  \n\r  \n7 cardamom pods\r  \n\r  \n7 cloves\r  \n\r  \n1 star anise\r  \n\r  \n1 medium red onion, sliced\r  \n\r  \n1 large green chilli, seeds removed and sliced\r  \n\r  \n3tsp of garlic and ginger paste\r  \n\r  \n2 small potatoes, small dice\r  \n\r  \n1 medium carrot, sliced\r  \n\r  \n80g (2.8oz) of green beans, sliced\r  \n\r  \n1\/2tsp of salt\r  \n\r  \n1tsp garam masala\r  \n\r  \n1\/2tsp turmeric\r  \n\r  \n1\/2tsp Kashmiri mild chilli powder\r  \n\r  \n1\/2tsp ground cumin\r  \n\r  \n5 curry leaves (optional)\r  \n\r  \n3tbsp of natural yoghurt\r  \n\r  \nhalf lemon juice and zest\r  \n\r  \n550ml (0.6quarts) of vegetable stock\n\n\r  \n\r  \n**Instructions for Biryani:**\r  \n\r  \n1.Soak the washed rice in water for 30-50 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n2.In a large frying pan or a pot, medium heat 2tbsp of ghee and fry aromatics for 2 minutes (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and star anise)\r  \n\r  \n3.Next, add sliced red onion, sliced green chilli and garlic and ginger paste, cook for 5 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n4.Turn up the heat and add 2 diced potatoes, sliced carrot and green beans, season with 1\/2tsp of salt and cook until starts to brown (10 minutes)\r  \n\r  \n5.Lower the heat and mix in garam masala, turmeric, mild chilli powder and cumin.\r  \n\r  \n6.Add 5 curry leaves, 3tbsp of natural yoghurt, rice and 550ml of vegetable stock, bring to a boil and reduce to simmer, cover with a lid and continue cooking for around 15 minutes or until rice absorbs all the liquid.\r  \n\r  \n7.Once ready, mix it with a spoon, cover with a lid and rest for another 15 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n8.Your Biryani is ready to be served, drizzle with lemon juice and zest, adjust the saltiness if necessary.

Prepare chicken breast\n\nPaper dry chicken breast and slice horizontally from the thicker side to a thinner, but stop about 1\/2 inches to it. This way you will \"butterfly\" your chicken breast, which is a well-known technique to make thin and large chicken pieces. \n\nCover your butterflied chicken breast with a piece of plastic wrap and roll a pin over it to make it even and thinner. Set aside.\n\n2.  Make mushroom stuffing \n\nMince 5 cloves of garlic and saut\u00e9 it in a frying pan over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add finely chopped 2 onions, keep saut\u00e9ing for another 2 minutes. Add chopped Portobello mushroom caps to the pan and keep cooking stirring occasionally for 5 more minutes or until all water will evaporate from the pan. \n\nAdd a quarter of a cup of dry White Wine, mix well and cook until stuffing gets almost dry. \n\nAt that point add 1 teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, and some fresh minced thyme. Mix well and set aside to cool down.\n\n3. Roll!\n\nPlace your chicken with a wide side down and thin side up like on the pictures below. \nDivide mushroom sauce into 3 parts: 2 for each chicken breast and 1 for the cream sauce for later. \n\nUsing a spoon, evenly spread 1 part of mushroom stuffing over the chicken piece, leaving half an inch on each side uncovered. \n\nNext, lay some thinly sliced fresh mozzarella, keep sides uncovered.\n\nGently roll chicken working your way from the wider bottom to the thinner top. Do not add too much pressure, as your stuffing will try to escape! We will secure everything in place with a cooking twine in just a second.\n\nNow it is time to wrap our roulade in prosciutto. Here is what I learned the hard way ( meaning one of the roulades on final pictures is an unsuccessful test, but still the same delicious ha!): lay prosciutto slices parallel to your chicken roll, this way it is much easier to cover the whole roulade, which will look so much better when the dish is done!\n\nTwine up! Using a cooking twine (the cotton string will work just fine!) gently wrap your roulade, starting from one side of it with tying a knot and work your way to the other side. Now you can add some pressure to help twine keep roulade`s shape while searing it. \n\n4. Sear roulade \n\nPreheat your skillet pan on medium heat. I used skillet mostly because I  wanted to be able to cook my dish both on a stovetop and in the oven, so if you have a suitable frying pan you can stick it into your cooking stove, - use that! Also, I used 2 tablespoons of canola oil to season my pan. \n\nAdd your chicken roulades into a hot pan and sear for 3 minutes on each of 4 sides.  Let it cool down for 5 minutes before proceeding to the final step.\n\n5. Sauce and bake\n\nGently remove twine by cutting each layer and pulling it.\n\nFinally, pour half a cup of heavy cream into your pan, add a third of the mushroom stuffing left from making roulades, and a little bit more cheese ( at this point you can use any cheese you love but make sure it is great melting one). \n\nPlace pan into the preheated to 370F oven and bake for 20 minutes. \nTo add some amazing color broil on High for just a minute before taking it out of the oven.",

Fry the chicken strips in peanut oil or another good frying oil on medium heat for ~ 5 minutes on each side or until you see the sauce begin to caramelize on the chicken and it's cooked through.  Set your chicken aside and then, if necessary, add a little more oil to the pan and throw in all of your minced garlic.  Turn up the heat here to high and once the garlic starts to brown slightly, throw in all of your chopped-up veggies.  Fry the veggies until you see them start to brown and then turn down the heat to medium-low and throw in all of your sauces along with the chicken.  Throw in the corn starch, MSG, and sugar, give this a good mix, and cook on medium-low for a minute or two.  Finally, kill the heat or turn down to the lowest setting and add in the basil.  Stir the basil around until it gets all saucy and nice.  It's important not to really cook the basil but to let the very low or residual heat and sauce do their work on it while you mix it in.",

Slice the chicken breasts into 5-6 pieces each and the thighs into 3-4 pieces each. Place them in a marinating dish or large plastic zipper bag.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together 1\/4 cup olive oil, the spices, 3\/4 tsp salt and 1\/4 tsp black pepper (if you are salt sensitive, use 1\/2 tsp of salt). Pour the spice marinade over the chicken pieces. Stir with a spoon till all the chicken pieces are evenly coated in the marinade.\n3. Cover the marinating dish with plastic wrap, or close the zipper bag. Place chicken in the refrigerator and let it marinate at least 1 hour, up to overnight.\n\n## Oven Cooking Method\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray the baking sheet with nonstick cooking oil. Place the chicken pieces on the sheet, evenly spaced.\n2. Place the chicken in the oven. Let it roast for about 15 minutes until cooked through, turning the chicken pieces once with tongs halfway through cooking.\n3. Take chicken out of the oven and let it cool slightly. Use a sharp knife to slice the meat into small, thin shawarma-like pieces.\n4. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a skillet on the stovetop over medium. Pour half of the chicken into the skillet and saute for 3-4 minutes till the smallest pieces of chicken turn brown and crisp. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste, if desired.\n5. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet. Heat another 1 tbsp of oil and saute the remaining chicken in the same way. Serve warm.\n\nEdit: Also thanks for giving me a lot of recipes to try out :)",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally:** [Peruvian Chicken Bowl with Potatoes](https:\/\/triedtruerecipe.com\/PeruvianChickenBowl)\n\nAn homage to my favorite Peruvian dinner recipes, this Peruvian chicken bowl with potatoes is a flavorful experience of contrasting textures.\n\nPrep Time: 15 minutes\n\nCook Time: 30 minutes\n\nInactive time: 45 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 1 hour 30 minutes\n\nServings: 4\n\nCalories: 673kcal\n\n## Equipment\n\n* Medium pot with lid\n* Baking sheet\n* Ovenproof skillet\n* Colander\n\n## Ingredients\n\n## Peruvian Chicken:\n\n* 2 pounds boneless, skin-on chicken thighs or boneless, skinless\n* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n* 1 mandarin juiced (or use 1 lime)\n* 1 tablespoon Aji rocoto optional\n* 1 tablespoon wild mountain cumin or use ground cumin\n* 2 teaspoons paprika\n* 2 teaspoons smoked paprika\n* 2 teaspoons garlic powder\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n* \u00bd teaspoon freshly ground white pepper optional\n* \u00bd teaspoon Mexican oregano\n* 2 teaspoons neutral oil for frying\n\n## Butter-Basted Potatoes\n\n* 2 russet or Yukon gold potatoes peeled and cut into thick round cylinders, about 2 inches thick\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* Salt to taste\n\n## Avocado Salad:\n\n* 1 avocado\n* 1 Roma tomato diced\n* 1 jalape\u00f1o trimmed and minced\n* \u00bc cup fresh cilantro leaves minced\n* 1 lime juiced\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n## Rice:\n\n* 1 cup uncooked white rice\n* 2 cups water\n* 1 tablespoon butter optional\n* Salt to taste\n\n## For Serving:\n\n* Aji verde\n* Minced cilantro\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Marinate the Chicken:\n\n* In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients for the marinade and stir until well-combined. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator for 30 minutes as you prepare the rest of the recipe.\n\n## Parboil the Potatoes:\n\n* Preheat oven to 425\u00baF. Cover the peeled and cut potatoes with water in the medium pot. Add salt and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are almost cooked through, about 8-9 minutes. Drain and transfer to a baking sheet to dry. Sprinkle with salt.\n\n## Prepare the Avocado Salad:\n\n* While the potatoes parboil, prepare the avocado salad. Peel and remove the seed from the avocado. Dice the avocado and transfer to a bowl with the lime juice, minced jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, and salt and pepper. Do not add the tomato until ready to serve.\n\n## Cook the Rice:\n\n* Rinse out the pot used to cook the potatoes. Combine the white rice with water, butter, and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest for 5-10 minutes.\n\n## Roast the Potatoes:\n\n* Melt the butter in a small bowl and use a brush to brush the tops and sides of the potatoes on the baking sheet. Transfer to the oven for 25-30 minutes or until they are fork-tender and golden brown. Once the potatoes start to turn golden brown, turn on the broiler for 3-5 minutes until the tops are crispy and well-browned. Remove from the oven and keep warm.\n\n## Cook the Chicken:\n\n* While the potatoes are roasting, prepare the chicken. Heat the neutral oil in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the chicken in an even layer\u2013cooking in batches if needed\u2013skin-side down. Cook without moving for 5 minutes until the skin is very crispy and well-browned. Transfer to a plate and brown the remaining chicken.\n* Nestle all the chicken thighs, skin-side up, in the skillet. It's okay if the skillet is a bit crowded since you've already browned the skin. Transfer to the oven with the potatoes and roast for 15 minutes until completely an instant-read thermometer reaches 165\u00baF.\n* You may broil the tops with the potatoes, as well, if you'd like to further crisp up the skin. Remove the chicken from the oven and transfer it to the stove top. Turn off the heat.\n\n## To Serve:\n\n* Right before serving, stir the tomatoes into the avocado salad. Season once more with salt to taste. Slice up the chicken thighs. Divide the cooked rice between shallow bowls and pile the chicken on top. Spoon the avocado salad on the other side of the bowl and arrange one or two butter-roasted potatoes on each plate. Garnish with more minced cilantro, if you like and a spoonful of aji verde.\n\n## Nutrition\n\nCalories: 673kcal | Carbohydrates: 68g | Protein: 40g | Fat: 27g | Saturated Fat: 9g | Trans Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 184mg | Sodium: 829mg | Potassium: 1324mg | Fiber: 7g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 1732IU | Vitamin C: 25mg | Calcium: 76mg | Iron: 4mg",

When ready take of the skewer and cover with tin foil to keep warm (thighs may need a little longer).\n\n**4.** To serve **cut pitta in half** and stuff with **salad**, **chicken** and **sauce** (pour some of the chicken juice inside for extra flavour).\n\n**Instructions for pitta:**\n\n**1.** For the pitta bread mix all the **dry ingredients** together then **add all the wet**. Mix then knead for around **5 minutes**, until a smooth dough ball is formed. Rest for **30 minutes** covered with bowl or clingfilm.\n\n**2.** Heat the oven to **250C (482F)** for at least **15 minutes** (for the pitta bread you will need to heat bakers stone, cast iron pan or a tray).\n\n**3.** Divide the pitta dough into **four** and roll each one to a **20cm circle** about **2mm thick** (8-inch circle, about 0.08inch thick).\n\n**4.** Place the dough on to the heated baking stone or cast iron pan. Applying heat from the bottom and the top will create puffed pitta, watch it closely not to burn it, this takes around **3,5 minutes**. (Do one at the time, and you may need to heat up your baking surface again before doing another one).\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Insight:**\n\n* I also like gyros chicken just with gherkin salad.\n* If your pitta is not puffed, increase temperature or try to heat the oven for a longer time or roll pittas slightly thicker. You may also need to reheat the stone\/cast iron between each pitta.\n\nBlog post with Pitta video recipe: [https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/chicken-gyros-kebab](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/chicken-gyros-kebab)",

        "recipe_comment":"I'm very excited to share a traditional dish that always adorns our dinner table during Lunar New Year!\n\nWe'll be covering:\n\n* How to poach a perfect, juicy **White Cut Chicken**\n* How to make my dad\u2019s addictive **Ginger Scallion sauce**\n* The traditional Chinese way to **carve and plate a chicken** from head to toe\n* The various Chinese idioms \/ meanings tied to whole chicken\n\nHere's a [video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PIX8it0BIao) if you want to follow a visual :)\n\n# Superstition: Chicken\n\nIn Chinese tradition, chicken is intertwined with many sayings and superstitions of good fortune, wealth, and resilience.\n\nEven though my parents didn't have much meat growing up in China, this is one of the dishes my parents always ate on Lunar New Year's eve and other festivities.\n\nEspecially with auspicious foods, Chinese superstition involves a lot of creative word-play. The word for chicken, g\u0101i in Cantonese and j\u012b in Mandarin, sounds like several words of good fortune.\n\nJust to name a few phrases that my parents shared with us:\n\n* h\u00f3u sai gaai \u597d\u4e16\u754c - A Cantonese phrase that roughly translates to good world, good life.\n* d\u00e0j\u00edd\u00e0l\u00ec \u5927\u5409\u5927\u5229 - A Mandarin phrase that roughly translates to great luck, great profit.\n* y\u00e1uh t\u00e0uh y\u00e1uh m\u00e9ih \u6709\u5934\u6709\u5c3e - A Cantonese phrase that literally translates to: \"has a head, has a tail.\" It means \"good beginning, good ending.\" This is one of the reasons why it's important to make a whole chicken for Lunar New Year.\n* j\u00e1au p\u00e0h j\u00e1au w\u00e0h \u6293\u6252\u6293\u93f5 - A Toisanese phrase, related to eating the chicken legs, that roughly means \"face all challenges with persistence.\"\n\nSo, basically, eat a whole chicken if you want to live. (jk)\n\n## The Recipe\n\nMain Ingredients\n\n* 4 lb **whole chicken** (traditionally for Lunar New Year, the chicken has its head &amp; feet intact)\n* 2 oz **green onion**\n* 1.5 oz **ginger**\n* 5 tbsp **corn oil**\n\nAdditional Flavor &amp; Seasoning\n\n* 1 tsp **salt** (for boiling water)\n* 2 tsp **salt** (for ginger scallion sauce)\n* 1 tbsp **sesame oil**\n\n# Step 1 - Boil water, add salt\n\nSet the stove to high heat and start boiling a generous amount of water in the pot you'll be using.\n\nWe'll want to be able to fully submerge our chicken in the water to make sure it cooks evenly.\n\nWe'll also be adding **1 teaspoon of salt**. My dad says not to add too much here.\n\n# Step 2 - Prepare &amp; cook chicken\n\n* Wait for the water to come to a boil.\n\nWe'll be doing a couple of things in this step, mostly to ensure that the entire chicken is cooked evenly for maximum tenderness.\n\n* **Pierce a hole in the skin in the neck -** This helps the water flow through the chicken cavity to help it cook more evenly.\n* **Stretch the legs away from the body several times -** This helps to avoid having a big clump of chicken meat that's undercooked.\n* **Slowly dip the chicken 3 times in the boiling water -** This helps even out the temperatures on the inside of the cavity and on the exterior of the chicken. Make sure the water is already boiling before you do this.\n* **Add the chicken and make sure it's completely submerged -** If you have to add more boiling water, do it.\n\nFrom here, we'll cover the pot.\n\nHere's a rough heat \/ timing overview:\n\n* Once the pot's been covered, leave it on high heat for 5 minutes as the water comes to a boil again.\n* Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for another 35-40 minutes. The larger the chicken, the longer you cook it. The sweet spot is 4 pounds.\n* Check if it's done. If so, transfer it to an ice bath. (More on both of these later.)\n\n# Step 3 - Mince scallions and ginger\n\nWhile we wait for the chicken to cook, we'll start on our sauce by mincing our **green onions** (2 oz) and **ginger** (1.5 oz)\u200b.\n\nMy dad said the exact ratio and amounts don't matter too much. Most recipes I've seen use more scallions than ginger.\n\nHaving a surplus of sauce is a great problem to have, since you can use it on pretty much everything. (I LOVE dousing my rice and vegetables in this addictive sauce)\n\nFor the green onions, we'll be using the white stems (about 4 stems at the default serving size). Cut each stem in half, length-wise, and then into strips. Then, mince the strips into fine pieces.\n\nFor the ginger, we'll be cutting them into thin slices, strips, and then fine pieces.\n\nMy dad is using separate plates to hold the green onions and ginger. The ginger will be cooked first in the next step, so this makes it easier to separate.\n\nAlso, feel free to use a food processor here instead of mincing.\n\n# Step 4 - Heat oil, cook ginger scallions\n\nWe'll heat up our wok on high heat and add **corn oil** (5 tbsp).\n\nThe oil should be around 350-400F before we add the ginger.\n\nA good visual cue is to wait until the oil starts \"shimmering\", or forming ripples across the surface due to the heat.\n\nWhy do we do this? By cooking everything in oil, we unlock the aromatics of the ginger and green onion.\n\nOnce the oil is hot enough, add the ginger and cook for about 15 seconds before adding the green onions. Cook everything for another 20-30 seconds before transferring the sauce to a bowl.\n\n# Step 5 - Flavor the sauce\n\nWe'll add **salt** (2 tsp) and **sesame oil** (1 tbsp) to the bowl, and mix for 30-60 seconds.\n\nDo a taste test and adjust if necessary. My dad emphasized multiple times how important it is to add sesame oil here, so make sure you don't skip it.\n\n# Step 6 - Prepare an ice bath\n\nGrab a big bowl and dump a few handfuls of ice into it. Fill it roughly halfway with cold water.\n\nThe ice bath is very important - once the chicken is done cooking, we need to immediately cool it down.\n\nWhy is this so important?\n\n* **It helps the meat contract and locks the juices inside - I**f we skip this step, juices will flood out as we chop the chicken into pieces.\n* **It helps the skin stay attached -** Without this step, we'll have a bunch of loose pieces of skin everywhere.\n* **It gives the skin a bit more of a chewy texture**\n\n# Step 7 - Determine if the chicken is done\n\nOnce the time draws near, we can uncover the pot. Poke the thickest part of the chicken (around the thigh) deeply with a chopstick.\n\nIf blood or red fluid leaks out, we need to cook it for a few more minutes.\n\nIf the fluid is clear, it's ready for the ice bath.\n\nFeel free to use your newfound chicken broth however you'd like. In the video, my dad created two additional dishes (a soup and a veggie) out of it by boiling bok choy with some ginger.\n\n# Step 8 - Lift and transfer to ice bath\n\nCarefully take two chopsticks under the chicken wings, and lift it over the pot.\n\nSuspend it over the pot for 30-45 seconds to let some of the residual water drip out.\n\nThen, carefully transfer it into the ice bath. Prepare for a splash!\n\nLet the chicken sit in the bath for 5 minutes, occasionally pouring water over the surface of the chicken and rotating the chicken in the container.\n\n# Step 9 - Carve the chicken\n\n* This could honestly be its own post, but for now it will live in a very detailed step in this recipe.\n\nThis is a lot easier to follow in our YouTube video, where we dedicate about 6 minutes of time to this segment.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind before you start.\n\n* My dad\u2019s done this hundreds of times, and it took him about 10 minutes from start to finish. It\u2019ll probably take a lot longer if you\u2019re a beginner like me, but the main thing is just to make sure your cleaver is sharp and that you\u2019re moving carefully and deliberately.\u00a0\n* If you don\u2019t already have a cleaver, it\u2019s still technically possible, but I highly recommend getting one if you plan on making this dish. Here are some options:\n   * Dexter Russell Heavy Duty Cleaver \n   * Saamhangnga Cleaver \n* For easier, safer cutting, you should use a larger, thicker cutting board that\u2019s preferably made of wood, and you should place a moist towel underneath it to increase its stability.\n\nHow to plate, according to Chinese tradition:\n\n* Basically everything is plated - even parts that aren't readily edible like the head.\n* Each piece of chicken is laid out on a large plate according to where it was on its body, head to toe, right to left.\n* You'll often see this served on a large oval-shaped plate.\n\nOrder of operations:\n\n* Cut off the neck and feet, cut into small pieces\n* Cut and place the head and butt at opposite ends of the middle axis of the plate\n* Remove the wings and thighs\n* Cut and split the torso into two halves (front and back)\n* Split the back in half, and cut it into pieces\n* Cut and pry away the breast bone, and cut it into pieces\n* Cut the thighs and wings into small pieces\n\nCutting techniques:\n\n* A technique my dad uses a lot involves making a shallow slice to wedge the cleaver, and then hitting down on the blade with our palm to drive the blade through the bone.\u00a0\n* In our recent knife skills interview, my dad talked about the 3 different parts of the blade - the root, the belly, and the tip. When chopping through bone, he always makes contact with the root, or the part of the blade closest to the handle.\u00a0\n\nWhen I first started this project, documenting how my dad carves a chicken was high on the list of traditions I wanted to learn and share. It always feels like I\u2019m watching an artist at work when I see my dad gracefully chop and plate everything.\u00a0\n\nEvery cut has an intention, and every piece has a place. Almost everything goes on the plate, and nothing is wasted. Especially for Lunar New Year and other celebrations, bak chit gai is meant to be one of the main decorative centerpieces on the dinner table, and carving it up into beautiful bite-sized pieces is an honor that I hope to take on one day for my own family.\u00a0\n\n-----\n\n# Our why\n\nI've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.\n\nThanks for reading! Hope you all love the recipes :)",

Once melted and frothy, add the mushrooms and cook for 10-15 minutes until the mushrooms release their liquid and the liquid evaporates and the mushrooms turn deep golden brown. Season with salt, pepper, and dry thyme and toss to coat.\n\n**Simmer the Stewed Mushrooms:**\n\n* Pour in the chicken stock and peppers and tomatoes and bring to a boil. Cook for 4-5 minutes or until the liquid reduces slightly. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Bake the Chicken:**\n\n* Arrange the chicken on top of the mushrooms and transfer to the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165\u00baF. If desired, turn on the broiler for the last two minutes to crisp up the skin again.\n\n**Cook the Rice:**\n\n* While the chicken bakes, cook the rice according to package instructions or prepare your favorite side dish, such as buttered noodles, boiled potatoes, or saut\u00e9ed green beans.\n\n**To Serve:**\n\n* Remove the chicken from the oven and sprinkle with parsley. If serving with rice, spoon the mushrooms over the rice and place the chicken on top. Garnish with a touch more parsley. Enjoy!\n\n**Notes**\n\nIf you don\u2019t have Oliverio peppers and tomatoes, use a 14.5-ounce can crushed or diced tomatoes, 1 cup diced roasted red peppers, and crushed red pepper to taste.\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nCalories: 528kcal | Carbohydrates: 46g | Protein: 26g | Fat: 27g | Saturated Fat: 9g | Cholesterol: 126mg | Sodium: 1703mg | Potassium: 1028mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 3g | Vitamin A: 1485IU | Vitamin C: 65mg | Calcium: 104mg | Iron: 3mg",

        "recipe_comment":"This perfectly seared duck breast with lingonberry sauce is a simple and beautiful meal.\n\n### Equipment\n\n* Skillet\n* Sauce pan\n* Large pot\n* Colander\n* Hand mixer\n\n### Ingredients\n\n#### Ricotta Mashed Potatoes:\n\n* 1\u00bd pounds Yukon gold potatoes peeled and quartered\n* \u00bd cup ricotta cheese\n* \u00bd cup whole milk plus more, as necessary\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* \u00bd teaspoon nutmeg plus more as desired\n* \u00bd teaspoon white pepper\n* Salt to taste\n\n#### Duck Breasts:\n\n* 2 Moulard magret duck breasts skin scored and breasts seasoned all over with salt and pepper\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n#### Lingonberry Sauce:\n\n* 2 teaspoons reserved duck fat\n* 3 tablespoons butter divided\n* 1 shallot peeled and minced\n* \u00bd cup lingonberry jam\n* 1 lemon juiced\n* 2 teaspoons sugar\n* \u00bc cup water\n\n#### For Serving:\n\n* 1 shallot peeled and thinly sliced into rounds\n* 4 ounces arugula\n* Salt and pepper\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Prepare the Potatoes:\n\n* Cover the diced Yukon gold potatoes with water and add salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 25 minutes until very soft. Drain into a colander and transfer to a large bowl.\n* Add the ricotta, milk, butter, nutmeg, and white pepper to the bowl and use a hand mixer or potato masher to blend until smooth and creamy. If desired, add a few splashes more of milk until desired consistency is reached. Taste and season with salt. Add more nutmeg or white pepper to taste, as desired. Keep the potatoes warm as you prepare the rest of the meal.\n\n#### Start the Duck:\n\n* Place the duck breasts, skin-side down, in a skillet (ensuring that there is enough room for both of them without them touching each other). Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for 10-15 minutes until the skin is very deep, golden brown and the fat has rendered out. As you cook the duck skin, use a spoon to remove some of the duck fat and transfer to a heat-proof bowl.\n* Flip the duck breasts and cook an additional 7-10 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 140\u00baF when inserted at the thickest part of the duck breast. Transfer to a wooden cutting board and cover with foil. Rest for 10 minutes before slicing.\n\n#### Prepare the Lingonberry Sauce:\n\n* While the duck is cooking, prepare the lingonberry sauce. Heat 1 tablespoon butter and two teaspoons of the reserved duck fat in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 2-3 minutes until softened.\n* Add the lingonberry jam, lemon juice, \u00bc water, and sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes until thickened. Once thickened and reduced, turn off the heat. Mount the butter into the sauce and stir until emulsified and glossy. Set aside.\n\n#### Cook the Arugula:\n\n* Immediately after the lingonberry sauce is cooked, prepare the arugula. Remove all but a tablespoon or two of duck fat from the skillet and transfer to the heatproof bowl.\n* Turn the skillet to medium heat and add the sliced shallot. Cook for 2 minutes until softened.\n* Add the arugula and cook for 3-4 minutes until mostly wilted. Turn off the heat and allow the residual heat to cook the arugula the rest of the way. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n#### To Serve:\n\n* Divide the mashed potatoes between shallow bowls. Pile the arugula on top and arrange the sliced duck breast on top. Spoon the lingonberry sauce on top. If you like, sprinkle a touch of nutmeg on top of the mashed potatoes and garnish with just a hint of flaky sea salt on top of the lingonberry sauce.

        "recipe_comment":"**VIETNAMESE GARLICKY ROAST CHICKEN!**  \nOftentimes when people think of Vietnamese food, they immediately think of pho or banh mi. Welp, Vietnamese people eat FAR more than just pho or banh mi, and at home, food is oftentimes far simpler and humbler, like this simple preparation of Vietnamese garlicky roast chicken. \n\n  \nRoast chicken has thousands of iterations across cultures, but this is one of my absolute favorites, and it\u2019s sooo simple: it\u2019s got just six ingredients plus the chicken, and after 30 minutes roasting in the oven, you\u2019ve got a lip-smackingly luscious bird that will beg to have its juices sopped up with some rice!\n\n  \nTo watch my video on how to make this:\u00a0[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90)  \n**Viet Garlicky Roast Chicken Recipe (adapted from Andrea Nguyen)**\u00a0\n\n  \n1 whole 3.5-4 lb chicken, preferably\u00a0organic and air-chilled,\u00a0spatchcocked (back bone removed with bird splayed flat), OR 3.5-4 lb chicken parts (thighs,\u00a0drumsticks, and wings)\u00a0\n\n  \n*Marinade ingredients:*\n\n* 4\u00a0whole garlic cloves,\u00a0minced finely\u00a0\n* 1 tsp black pepper\n* 1.5 tsp sugar\n* 1\/4 tsp kosher salt\n* 1.5 Tbsp\u00a0neutral oil\n* 3.5 Tbsp Maggi seasoning\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Combine all sauce\u00a0ingredients into a bowl and mix well.\u00a0\n2. Prepare\u00a0the chicken: take the chicken (or chicken parts), and using a chopstick or skewer, carefully\u00a0separate the skin from the meat all over. Then, add the marinade sauce all\u00a0over\u00a0the chicken with your hands, making sure to get the sauce\u00a0between the meat\u00a0and the skin.\u00a0\n3. Refrigerate the chicken\u00a0and\u00a0allow to marinade for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor\u00a0penetration.\u00a0\n4. The next day, preheat oven to 500 F. Place spatchcocked\u00a0chicken on a cast iron roasting pan or roasting tray.\u00a0Place\u00a0chicken in the oven and roast for about 30 minutes, checking about 5-10\u00a0min in to ensure the chicken isn\u2019t browning too quickly. If it is, tent the darker parts with foil and lower heat to 450 F. If using parts, roast time may be closer to 40-45 min.\u00a0\n5. After about 30 minutes, remove chicken from the oven. Check doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer - thighs should register about 165 F when done.\u00a0\n6. Once the chicken is done,\u00a0allow to rest for 15 min to ensure optimal\u00a0juiciness level. Then,\u00a0cut and serve with rice and\u00a0enjoy.\u00a0",

        "recipe_comment":" Full recipe and link to other recipes is [Here](https:\/\/www.forkandpepper.com\/post\/recipe-time-stuffed-acorn-squash). I just started a recipe &amp; reviews site, so any traffic is much appreciated!\n\nStuffed squash is a great healthy and simple way to kick off the fall cooking season! It's also a great way to use up leftovers. I happened to use some leftover chicken for the filling, but if you don\u2019t have that, any ground or shredded turkey or chicken can work as a substitute. The quinoa &amp; garlic was also leftover from the prior day, but that can be cooked as needed as well.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 acorn squash\n* 1 cup of shredded chicken (or cooked ground chicken)\n* \u00bd cup cooked quinoa\n* 2 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro\n* \u2153 squeezed lemon juice\n* \u00bd cup chopped walnuts\n* 2 cloves of roasted garlic\n* \u00bd cup blueberries\n* 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar\n* \u2153 cup chopped feta cheese\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.\n2. Cut the squash in half, lengthwise, and oil both sides. Remove seeds from squash. Place it face down on a lined baking sheet and bake at 450 for 30 minutes.\n3. In a bowl, mix all ingredients together except the feta cheese. Save a small amount of the cilantro for topping.\n4. When squash is finished, scoop out a small cavity to make the hole larger, and combine scooped squash with the other ingredients.\n5. Fill the squash halves and top with feta cheese.\n6. Bake for 10 minutes at 450.\n7. When you remove them from the oven, top with the remaining cilantro.",

Remove the stems and seeds from the chipotles.\n2. Rehydrate the chipotles by putting them in a bowl and covering them with boiling water.\n3. Put the chicken breasts in a pot, as well as half the onion and a teaspoon of salt. \n4. Add water until it covers the chicken and put the pot on high heat.\n5. When the water begins to boil, reduce the heat to medium and let simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked.\n6. Let it cool down while you are preparing the sauce.\n7. If you can\/want, char the skin of the bell pepper and tomatoes. I generally remove the charred skin of the bell pepper but keep on the tomatoes.\n8. Put in a blender half an onion, the garlic cloves, tomatoes, bell pepper, the rehydrated chipotle with their water and a teaspoon of salt, and blend until smooth.  \n9. Preheat some oil in a pan on medium-high heat and pour the sauce in it. Cook it for 5-10 minutes or until the consistency you like.\n10. Shred the chicken and grate the cheeses.\n11. Preheat your oven at 200\u00b0C (or 390\u00b0F).\n12. Pour a little of your sauce in a baking dish.\n13. Fill up the tortillas with the shredded chicken and half of the cheese, and put them in the baking dish.\n14. Pour the rest of the sauce on top of the tortilla and add the rest of the cheese.\n15. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is nicely melted and slightly golden-brown.\n\nEnjoy ;)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Discussion and recipe](https:\/\/www.nomnumnyum.com\/post\/chipotle-chicken-enchiladas)",

Whichever brand of Turkish delight you buy, make sure it\u2019s actually made in Turkey) \n\n\n**Directions:**\n\n\n&gt;1. **One cup of Turkish coffee = one heaped teaspoon of coffee grounds.** Put a heaped, overflowing teaspoon of Turkish coffee (or just really fine coffee grounds) in the jezve, the Turkish coffee pot. Or, if you\u2019re making two cups, you need two teaspoons of coffee, and so on. Why? If you don\u2019t use a really heaped teaspoon of coffee, there won\u2019t be enough concentration of oils for the crema. Make sure you use fairly fresh coffee \u2014 which means coffee grounds that haven\u2019t been sitting around for more than a month, otherwise those oils will have dried up.\n\n\n\n&gt;2. **\u2018Toast\u2019 the coffee.** Put the coffee pot on the very smallest ring on your stovetop. If you don\u2019t use the smallest ring, you\u2019ll waste energy and likely cook your coffee too fast. Turn on to a low to medium heat. Why? Although you\u2019ve only got coffee grounds in your pot, and no water yet, turning the heat on now for a few seconds helps \u2018toast\u2019 or warm the grounds, which gives off a pleasing aroma and helps develop the flavour. You can also add sugar at this step. Use one teaspoon for mildly sweet coffee, and two teaspoons (or more) for sweet coffee. I personally don\u2019t add sugar, because I like the Turkish coffee\u2019s bitter flavour.\n\n\n&gt;3. **One cup of Turkish coffee = one espresso cup of water.** Now, you\u2019ll add the water. The rule is one cup of water for one cup of coffee. Use your espresso cup to measure the right amount of water. Make sure to run the tap first, so you\u2019re using fresh water. Why? Fresh water is more likely to be aerated from having just run through the faucet \u2014 so this will help your coffee have a more bubbly crema.\n\n\n&gt;4. **Shallow-stir the Turkish coffee with a piece of wood.** Stir the coffee using a piece of wood. Why? Stirring with a piece of wood apparently avoids damage to the metal of the jezve. I use a kebab stick \u2014 but any piece of wood will do, like a toothpick or a chopstick. Using a thin piece of wood also stops too many of the grounds sticking to it, instead of staying in your jezve. To help the coffee grounds dissolve into the water, you\u2019ll want to stir just the floating grounds of coffee at the top. Don\u2019t over-stir the coffee, as this will make the bubbles disappear, meaning your coffee will be less frothy. Many people prefer to hardly stir the coffee at all \u2014 giving it only three to six stirs.\n\n\n&gt;5. **Let the Turkish coffee brew.** I advise a medium low heat, so that you don\u2019t cook the coffee too fast. However, any heat will do \u2014 but of course, the lower the heat, the longer you\u2019ll have to wait for your delicious cup of Turkish coffee!\n\n\n&gt;6. **Keep your eye on the Turkish coffee as it brews**. While a watched pot never boils, an unwatched Turkish coffee pot boils instantly. I can\u2019t keep track of the number of times my Turkish coffee\u2019s boiled over \u2014 and remember, if it\u2019s reached boiling point, you\u2019ll need to start over again.  Why? Turkish coffee needs to be heated to around 99\u00b0C, or 210\u00b0F. Any hotter, and it\u2019ll extremely quickly lose its crema and flavour, and taste ashy. More later on temperature \u2014 and knowing when it\u2019s ready.\n\n\n&gt;7. **Slowly rotate the jezve, while tapping it with a spoon.** What\u2019s very important not to do is deep-stir the Turkish coffee. Why? This will make all the grounds rise to the top. As you don\u2019t filter Turkish coffee, if you stir your coffee at this stage, while it\u2019s brewing, all the coffee sediment at the bottom will rise to the top \u2014 leading to a gritty and unpleasant mouthfeel. But what you do want to do is very gently introduce any remaining undissolved grounds to the water, which will now be hot. To do this, slowly rotate the jezve while it\u2019s on the stovetop, and tap the outside of the jezve with a teaspoon. 10\u201315 taps of a teaspoon, and three to four gentle rotations of the jezve will do.\n\n\n&gt;8. **As the bubbles slowly start to rise, prepare to remove the jezve from the heat.** This is the most crucial moment of your Turkish coffee brewing \u2014 wait too long, and the coffee will start to boil, which, as mentioned earlier, will ruin the flavour and crema almost instantly. If you\u2019ve used reasonably fresh coffee that\u2019s not been sitting around more than a month, you will see bubbles start to rise, usually around the outer edge. Often, the bubbles will not rise evenly. If you see a part of the crema that\u2019s not so well formed, move the jezve to apply more heat to that part. This is a lot easier with a gas stove than electric or induction \u2014 but if you don\u2019t have a gas stove, you can simply tilt the jezve towards the stove ring on the part that needs a more foamy, developed crema. Remember: stay on the side of caution. A slightly under-brewed Turkish coffee will taste far better than a burned, over-brewed one. When you see the bubbles suddenly speed up, rising up the inside of the jezve, that\u2019s a sign you need to take the jezve off the heat, right now\n\n\n&gt;9. **Pour the coffee into the espresso cup slowly, and never pour from a height.** Why? If you pour from a height, you\u2019ll disturb your crema, and cause it to \u2018dissolve\u2019 into the coffee. Pour slowly, and in stages. The crema will likely appear on the top of you espresso cup when you\u2019re about halfway through pouring. If you\u2019ve made more than one cup of Turkish coffee, you\u2019re going to want to divide the foam democratically \u2014 after all, the crema is the bit everyone wants to see! To divide the foam democratically, pour some of the coffee in the first cup, and then some in the second cup, and then repeat until you\u2019ve poured all the coffee from the jezve to the cups.  One common technique calls for skimming the crema from the jezve with a teaspoon first, and placing that in the espresso cup, and then pouring the coffee, but this isn\u2019t necessary if you\u2019ve taken the time to pour the coffee alternately in each cup.\n\n\n&gt;10. **Enjoy! And don\u2019t drink down to the dregs.** In life, you don\u2019t want to scrape the bottom of the barrel. And with Turkish coffee, never drink the bottom few millimetres. It\u2019s where the coffee grit, or sediment, lives \u2014 and where the grit needs to stay until it\u2019s time to wash up. Some people like to tell their fortune by looking at the grounds \u2014 but I personally prefer to spend my time making ever-better Turkish coffee. \n\nNow is also the time to eat that optional piece of Turkish delight, which is particularly desirable if you\u2019ve not added sugar to your coffee \u2014 as remember, Turkish coffee is bitter!\n\nHappy to answer any questions for me on Turkish coffee below. \n\n*Edited for mobile formatting.",

Towards the end, you should be able to notice, the meat has visibly become \u201cwhiter\u201d.\n3. While we are soaking the beef shin, we can start preparing the beef tomatoes. Give them a light cross cut on top. Make sure you cut through the skin.\n4. Bring a pot of water to a boil and gently drop your tomatoes in, let them sit for a good 30 seconds.\n5. Take them out and rinse under cold water then peel their skin off.\n6. Cut peeled tomatoes into small chunks, approximately 2cm x 2cm.\n7. Heat up a cooking pot, and add \u00bd tbsp of vegetable oil, wait for it to heat up. Add 1 star anise, \u00bd cinnamon stick, 3 pieces of bay leaves, and 3 slices of ginger in the oil quickly stir fry.\n8.

        "recipe_comment":"Hello, food lovers! The colder months are upon us, and in England, there\u2019s no heartier dish for the evening than Steak and Ale Pie with Guinness. This versatile recipe is expertly balanced to mitigate the bitterness of the stout, earning it the title of Best Ale Beef Pie. Additionally, I\u2019ve included methods for preparing it solely as a stew or using a slow cooker for added convenience. Lets get cooking!\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n\\* 1.1 lbs Beef stewing steak - (500g) diced\n\n\\* 3 Onions, medium size - peeled and diced\n\n\\* 2 Carrots, medium size - peeled and diced\n\n\\* 1 Celery stalk - fine dice\n\n\\* 6 Garlic cloves - sliced\n\n\\* 1.1 lbs Potatoes - (500g) large dice\n\n\\* 1 can Guinness - (440ml) or other ale or stout\n\n\\* 1.7 cups Beef stock - (400ml)\n\n\\* 2 tbsp Tomato paste\n\n\\* 1 tbsp Fresh thyme\n\n\\* 1 tsp Black pepper\n\n\\* 2 tbsp Vegetable oil\n\n\\* 2 tbsp All-purpose flour\n\n\\* 1 sheet Ready-rolled puff pastry\n\n\\* 1 Egg - beaten (for glazing)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**1.** In a large pot or deep skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Toss the beef cubes in flour, shaking off the excess, and brown them in the hot oil. Remove and set aside.\n\n**2.** In the same pot, add a bit more oil if needed and saut\u00e9 the onions, carrots, and celery until softened. Add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes.\n\n**3.** Pour in the Guinness and beef stock, then add the tomato paste. Stir well, ensuring all the brown bits from the bottom of the pot are incorporated.\n\n**4.** Add the browned beef back into the pot, season with salt and pepper, and stir. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 1 hour.\n\n**5.** After 1 hour of simmering, add the diced potatoes into the pot and continue simmering for another 30 minutes to 1 hour, or until the beef is tender and the sauce has thickened.\n\n**6.** Preheat your oven to 356\u2109 (180\u00b0C) in preparation for baking the pie.\n\n**7.** Once the filling is ready, if you prefer a thicker sauce, you can thicken it further using a gravy mix or a slurry of flour and water. Stir until the desired consistency is achieved. Transfer the thickened filling to a pie dish. Roll out the puff pastry and place it over the top of the filling, crimping the edges. Make a small slit in the centre for steam to escape. Brush the top with the beaten egg for a golden finish.\n\n**8.** Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.\n\n**9.** Allow the pie to rest for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy with a side salad or additional vegetables if desired :)\n\nBlog post\/print version: [Steak and Ale Pie - Chefs Binge](https:\/\/chefsbinge.com\/steak-and-ale-pie-guinness\/)",

        "recipe_comment":"Check out rich flavours of Caribbean Food with this authentic Aloo Pie recipe, a delectable Pie with Beef and potato filling. Renowned as a staple in Caribbean street food, this beef hand pie is a perfect dish that embodies the essence of the tropical islands.\n\nTo craft this savoury treat, the beef is marinated and slow-cooked to perfection before being enveloped in a crisp dough, ready for shallow frying. Drawing inspiration from Trinidad\u2019s unique fusion of African, Creole, and Indian culinary traditions, this dish stands out in its flavour profile. Enjoy Cooking!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for the marinade:**\n\n\\* 0.9 lbs Beef Shin - (400g) small dice (or other stewing cut)\n\n\\* \u00bd tsp Salt\n\n\\* \u00bd tsp Black Pepper\n\n\\* 2 Scallions - sliced and washed\n\n\\* 1 handful Cilantro - (Coriander)\n\n\\* 1 Tomato, medium size - diced\n\n\\* 1 tbsp Ketchup\n\n\\* 1 tsp Mild Curry Powder\n\n\\* \u00bd Lime, juice only\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for the Aloo filling:**\n\n\\* 3.5 oz Peas - (100g)\n\n\\* 14 oz Potatoes, waxy type - (400g) peeled and cut in small dice (keep them in water until needed)\n\n\\* 1 tsp Cumin\n\n\\* 1\u00bd tbsp Mild Curry Powder\n\n\\* 1 Red chilli - small dice\n\n\\* 3 Garlic clove - minced\n\n\\* 1 Onion, medium size - sliced\n\n\\* 3 tbsp Vegetable Oil\n\n\\* 1 Beef stock cube\n\n\\* 2\u00bd cups Water - (600ml)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for the Aloo pastry:**\n\n\\* 10 oz All Purpose Flour - (280g) sieved\n\n\\* \u00bc tsp Ground Cardamom\n\n\\* \u00bd tsp Ground Turmeric\n\n\\* \u00bd tsp Salt\n\n\\* 2 tsp Baking Powder\n\n\\* \u00be cup Water - (175ml)\n\n\\* 1\u2153 cup Vegetable Oil - for shallow frying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instructions for the Aloo Pie filling:**\n\n**1.** To start off, marinate the beef with a blend of salt, pepper, spring onions, coriander, tomato, ketchup, curry powder and lime juice. You may choose to marinate the beef overnight or just before cooking.\n\n**2.** In a frying pan, heat 3 tbsp of oil over medium heat. Introduce onion, garlic, and chili, cooking until they turn golden-brown, around 5 minutes. Incorporate the curry powder and ground cumin, cooking for an additional 2 minutes. Pour in 4tbsp of water, allowing it to evaporate completely over the next 5 minutes.\n\n**3.** Incorporate the marinated beef into the pan, mixing thoroughly. Cover the pan, reduce the heat, and simmer for 35 minutes.\n\n**4.** As the beef continues to cook, introduce potatoes and water, followed by a beef stock cube. Allow it to come to a boil before reducing to a simmer. Continue cooking uncovered for about 50 minutes or until it thickens and most of the water evaporates. Add peas in the last 10 minutes of cooking. Taste and adjust seasonings accordingly. Once done, transfer to a large plate, spreading it out to expedite cooling and ease handling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instructions for the pastry and assembly:**\n\n**1.** Begin dough preparation by combining sieved flour with baking powder, salt, turmeric, and cardamom. Knead this mixture into a ball, cover, and let it rest for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n\n**2.** Dust your workspace with flour, dividing the dough into 8 even balls. Roll each into approximately 10cm diameter circles. Spoon the beef mixture into each circle's centre, sealing by folding and pinching the edges. Moistening the edges may aid in ensuring they adhere.\n\n**3.** Position the pies on a cloth, potentially covering them with another cloth to retain moisture.\n\n**4.** Preheat oil in a pan to 374\u2109 (190\u2103) in readiness for shallow frying. Fry each pie for about a minute on each side. After frying, drain excess oil by placing the pies on paper towels.\n\n**5.** Once all pies are cooked, serve them with mango chutney, salad, and dressing of your choice for a complete meal experience.

Cook, turning occasionally, for 7\u20138 minutes until lightly browned. Continue cooking for an additional 2\u20133 minutes until deep golden brown. Season lightly with salt and transfer to the bowl with the beef.\n\n**Saut\u00e9 the mirepoix:**\n\n1. If the pot is dry, add another drizzle of neutral oil. Turn the heat to medium and add the onion, celery, and carrots. Season all over with salt and pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, for 7\u20138 minutes until the onions are translucent and the carrots begin to brown around the edges.\n2. Melt the butter in the pot and add the garlic and thyme. Toss to coat and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n**Simmer the stew:**\n\n1. Sprinkle the flour over the aromatics and toss to coat. Cook for 1\u20132 minutes until nutty and aromatic. Add \u00bd cup of the water or beef stock and whisk to form a slurry. Continue adding the liquid, in \u00bd-cup increments until all 4 cups of liquid have been incorporated.\u00a0\n2. Return the beef and mushrooms to the pot. Add the remaining 1\u20132 cups liquid if needed to ensure the beef is completely submerged with liquid. Taste and season the broth with more salt and pepper, if needed. *Note: You may need to add more liquid as the beef cooks. You can use additional beef stock or continue adding water if the broth of the stew evaporates too quickly.*\n3. Reduce the heat on the beef stew to low. Cover and simmer and 1\u00bd hours. Check the stew occasionally and add more liquid as needed.\n\n**Finish the stew:**\n\n1. Uncover the stew and simmer for an additional 15\u201320 minutes, uncovered. Taste and season once more to your preferences.\n2. Add the frozen peas and cook for 5 minutes until warmed through and bright green. Turn off the heat.\n\n**Prepare the noodles:**\n\n1. As the stew finishes simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook according to the package instructions. Drain and rinse and set aside. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.\n2. Turn the heat to medium and add the butter. Whisk often for 5\u20137 minutes until it turns golden brown and takes on a nutty aroma. As soon as the butter browns, add the garlic and parsley and turn off the heat. Stir constantly off the heat for at least 30 seconds to cook the garlic and prevent the butter from burning.\n3. Once the butter is nice and fragrant and garlicky, add the cooked noodles and toss to coat. Add salt and pepper to taste. If your noodles are cold, you can return the pot to the stovetop and warm them up over gentle heat right before serving.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the cooked noodles between bowls and pile the stew on top. Enjoy!",

Then, keep it warm as you prepare the stir-fry.\n\n**Prepare the marinade:**\n\n* Gather all of the ingredients for the marinade except the cornstarch and beef in a large bowl. Stir until completely combined. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add the cornstarch and stir until smooth. Set aside.\n* Pat the beef dry and cut (with the grain) into 4-inch long pieces to make it easier to slice into strips. Next, cut the resulting beef pieces against the grain into \u00bd-inch wide strips. Cutting against the grain will yield the most tender beef, so be mindful of how you slice!\n* Add the beef to the bowl of marinade and toss to coat.

Once shimmering, add the onion, snow peas, and red bell pepper. Cook in batches if needed. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the pepper begins to char and the snow peas are bright green and tender, about 5\u20137 minutes. Stir in the ginger and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.\n* Remove the vegetables from the skillet and transfer to a bowl.\n\n**Cook the beef:** \n\n* Add the remaining oil to the skillet over medium-high heat.  Once hot, pour in the beef with all of the marinade. A splatter screen will help with the sputtering! Spread the beef into an even layer. Cook for 3\u20134 minutes until the beef begins to brown and the marinade is bubbling.\n* Crank the heat during the first 3 minutes and watch it closely to develop a sear on the beef without burning the marinade. Then, adjust the heat back to medium-high. It will look like the sauce separates as it cooks, but don\u2019t worry!\n* After 3\u20134 minutes, flip the beef and continue cooking, often turning, for 2\u20134 minutes or until the beef is mostly cooked through.\n* Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and stir to develop a thick sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings. Turn off the heat and stir in the vegetables. Toss to coat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n* Arrange the cooked white rice on a serving platter and pile the stir-fried beef and vegetables on top.

When ready, remove the mushrooms and strain the water through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any grit or sand. Transfer the mushroom water to a slow cooker dish, leaving behind the last 50 ml (1\/4 cup) of water that may contain sediment.\n\n**2.** In a frying pan, sear the lardons and sausage over high heat until browned. Transfer the meat to the slow cooker, leaving the fat in the pan.\n\n**3.** In the same pan, brown the diced onions until softened and lightly browned. Transfer them to the slow cooker.\n\n**4.** Next, brown the diced beef in two batches until browned on all sides. Transfer it to the slow cooker.\n\n**5.** Add all the remaining ingredients to the slow cooker, including the hydrated mushrooms, and stir well to combine. Cover with a lid and set the slow cooker to high heat for 5 hours. After the first hour, give it a good stir and repeat every hour or so to distribute the flavours.\n\n**6.** When the Bigos is ready, remove the bay leaves and serve hot with sourdough bread or boiled potatoes. Bigos tastes better with time, so you can store it in the fridge for up to three days, freeze it, or store it in jars if you make a bigger batch. Reheat it gently on the stovetop or in the microwave before serving. Enjoy!",

Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Pat the short ribs dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Add them to the pot and cook without moving for 4-5 minutes per side until well-browned all over.\n* Add the onions and garlic to the pot and cook for 3-4 minutes more. Pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Turn the heat off. Cover and transfer to the oven for 2-3 hours or until the short ribs are tender.\n\nBoil the Short Ribs:\n\n* Transfer the short ribs to the stovetop and remove the lid. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and reduce heat to medium. Low-boil the short ribs for about 30 minutes or until the broth has reduced significantly. Reduce heat to low. *At this point, you can either turn off the heat and transfer to the fridge overnight or you can continue through with the recipe without refrigerating the ribs overnight.*\n\nShred the Short Ribs:\n\n* Remove the bone and gristle from each of the ribs. Using two forks, shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\nFinish the Broth:\n\n* Add enough water or stock to cover the shredded meat. If you'd like a more brothy udon, add more stock, but you shouldn't need to add more than 3 cups of water or stock.\n* Bring the broth to a boil and add the sesame oil, tamari, and mirin. Stir in the minced scallions and sliced shiitake mushrooms. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.\n\nCook the Udon Noodles:\n\n* As the broth simmers a final time, cook the udon noodles. Drain, rinse, and set aside.\n\nTo Serve:\n\n* Divide the udon between bowls and ladle the broth on top. Pile the shredded short ribs on top and garnish as you like.

When tri-tip is on sale I will buy 4-5 lbs and prepare freezer packs for later easy meals. It only takes about 15 minutes to prepare once the steak is marinated. Freezer instructions included below. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 lb tri-tip steaks, or similar\r\n* \u00bd cup white onion diced (\\~\u00bc large onion)\r\n* 8-10 extra small flour or corn tortillas (I use flour)\r\n* \u00bc cup fresh cilantro\r\n* 1 lime sliced into wedges, for serving\r\n\n*For Marinade:*\r\n\n* \u00bc cup lime juice\r\n* \u00bc cup olive oil\r\n* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce\r\n* 2 tsp salt\r\n* 2 tsp onion powder\r\n* 2 tsp paprika\r\n* 1 tsp chili powder\r\n* 1 tsp garlic powder\r\n* 1 tsp cumin\r\n* 1 tsp black pepper\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Combine all ingredients of the marinade. Trim excess fat from the steaks and place in a zip bag with the marinade. Marinate in fridge for at least 6 hours before cooking (preferably overnight).\r\n2. When ready to cook, remove the steak from the bag and discard the rest of the marinade (shake off excess but do not pat the steaks dry). Grill steak to desired doneness, or cook in a cast iron pan with a swirl of olive oil. I cook in mine in a cast iron pan over high heat, turning every few minutes, until an internal temp of 135\u00b0F, about 8-10 minutes. (Note, the marinade may cause some additional charring on the outside, but this contributes to the flavor and isn't noticeable after slicing)\r\n3. Let the steak rest for a few minutes, then slice into small pieces as pictured. Toss the steak in the juices after cutting.\r\n4. Warm tortillas for a few seconds in the microwave, or a pan over medium low heat. Divide the steak evenly between the tortillas, then top with onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime to taste.\r\n\n**To prepare in bulk for freezer:**\r\n\n1. Trim steaks and prepare appropriate quantity of marinade. Package steaks, in marinade, in a freezer safe zip bag or vacuum bag. Package size should be the quantity you will want to defrost at a time (I do 1 lb).\r\n2. Place marinated steak packs in the freezer directly after preparing.\r\n\n**To prepare from frozen:**\r\n\n1. Defrost steak at least 6 hours before you plan to cook it, giving the steak time to marinate. I suggest moving from the freezer to fridge the night before.\r  \nFollow the rest of the recipe as written, preparing the topping ingredients fresh.\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear your feedback\/modifications\/etc. in the comment section!**",

Add the melted butter, milk, and white pepper to the potatoes and mash until smooth and creamy. Taste and season with salt.\n2. Prepare the cottage pie: Grease a baking dish with butter, if needed. Pour the gravy into the baking dish and spoon or pipe the mashed potatoes on top. Smooth it out with the back of your spoon.\n3. Transfer to the oven for 30 minutes.\n\n**Broil the cottage pie, optional:**\n\n1. Pour 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the mashed potatoes.

Remove from the pan and leave to cool.\r  \n\r  \n3.\tFinely chop the mushrooms and fry in a hot pan with a little olive oil, the thyme leaves and some seasoning. When the mushrooms begin to release their juices, continue to cook over a high heat for about 10 minutes until all the excess moisture has evaporated and you are left with a mushroom paste (known as a duxelle). Remove the duxelle from the pan and leave to cool.\r  \n\r  \n4.\tCut the pastry in half, place on a lightly floured surface and roll each piece into a rectangle large enough to envelop one of the beef fillets.

Spread half the duxelle evenly over the ham.\r  \n\r  \n6.\tSeason the beef fillets, then place them on top of the mushroom-covered ham. Using the cling film, roll the Parma ham over the beef, then roll and tie the cling film to get a nice, evenly thick log. Repeat this step with the other beef fillet, then chill for at least 30 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n7.\tBrush the pastry with the egg wash. Remove the cling film from the beef, then wrap the pastry around each ham-wrapped fillet. Trim the pastry and brush all over with the egg wash. Cover with cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n8.\tMeanwhile, make the red wine sauce. Heat the oil in a large pan, then fry the beef trimmings for a few minutes until browned on all sides. Stir in the shallots with the peppercorns, bay and thyme and continue to cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the shallots turn golden brown.\r  \n\r  \n9.\tPour in the vinegar and let it bubble for a few minutes until almost dry. Now add the wine and boil until almost completely reduced. Add the stock and bring to the boil again. Lower the heat and simmer gently for 1 hour, removing any scum from the surface of the sauce, until you have the desired consistency. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve lined with muslin. Check for seasoning and set aside.\r  \n\r  \n10.\tWhen you are ready to cook the beef wellingtons, score the pastry lightly and brush with the egg wash again, then bake at 200\u00b0C\/Gas 6 for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and cooked.

Mix brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar, garlic, and ginger in bowl. Optionally, add a dash of MSG if desired.\n2. Over medium heat, cook the beef until cooked through and no longer pink, drain the excess fat.\n3. Stir in soy sauce mixture and simmer for at least 10 mins. The sauce should reduce, and the beef will darken in color.\n4. Serve beef over a bed of white rice, top with green onion, red pepper flakes, and sesame seeds.\n\n**To Freeze**\n\n1. Allow the beef mixture to cool to room temp, then portion it out into freezer-safe containers or zip bags. Fill each container with the portion size you plan to reheat all at once (you cannot easily divide it once frozen). Freeze for up to 3 months before using.\n\n**To Reheat from Frozen**\n\n1. Defrost the beef by moving the container to the fridge 12-24 hours in advance, or defrost the sealed container quickly in cool water. The beef doesn\u2019t need to be fully thawed, just enough to get it out of the container and broken up into a few chunks.\n2. Warm the meat in a skillet over medium heat until fully defrosted and sizzling, then reduce the heat to low until ready to serve. Serve over a bed of white rice, top with green onion, red pepper flakes, and sesame seeds.\n\n# Freezer Tips!\n\n* Make 2-3 lbs at a time, and get multiple pans going! When browning beef, you want to make sure that you don\u2019t overcrowd the pan. When I\u2019m making jumbo batches for the freezer, I usually split the meat between my two largest skillets. Once the meat has simmered in the sauce and it\u2019s time to serve, I\u2019ll combine them into one pan and do a final mix to make sure the sauce and flavor is all evenly distributed.\n   * My grocery store sells ground beef in 3 lb packages at a slight discount, so that\u2019s usually what I pick up for this dish!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Think about portion sizes as you package the freezer meals. How much meat do you plan to defrost at one time? Will you defrost a whole batch to feed the family, or maybe just 1 portion for you? Whatever the quantity is, make sure it\u2019s packaged in its own bag. That will make it super easy to defrost when you want to use it. It\u2019s difficult to separate into smaller portions once frozen.\n   * My husband and I tend to eat large portions for dinner, so a 3 lb batch will be 4 total meals for us. When we prepare a 3 lb batch, we eat one portion that night, and pack the other 3 up for later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Grab bags of microwave rice for an easy meal for 1. I\u2019m pretty picky when it comes to rice, but the microwaveable single-serve bags of rice are surprisingly good! If you plan to defrost the leftovers to prepare a meal for 1, having the instant rice on hand makes the process that much easier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Defrost portions in the fridge or in cool water. The safest way to defrost a portion is to move it into the freezer a day ahead of time, though I\u2019ll admit that this meal is frequently a last minute decision so that method doesn\u2019t always work for me.\n   * When defrosting meats (even cooked meats) you want to make sure they don\u2019t spend too much time in the temperature \u201cdanger zone\u201d for bacteria growth which is\u00a040 \u00b0F \u2013 140 \u00b0F. You can quickly defrost meat by submerging the container in cool water, but make sure the water isn\u2019t warm and that you pay attention so that the meat isn\u2019t sitting out too long. You can defrost the meat completely, or just enough to get it out of the bag and broken into a few sections \u2013 it\u2019ll finish defrosting as it\u2019s heated in the pan (though this will take some extra time)\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear your feedback in the comments!**",

        "recipe_comment":"**Ingredients**\n\nFor the tongue:\n\n* 1 whole beef tongue (you can usually ask your butcher for it)\n* 1 carrot\n* 1 onion\n* Bay leaves\n* Thyme\n* A couple of peppercorns\n\nFor the pickles:\n\n* 1 white sweet onion\n* Mustard seeds (dry)\n* *'Hamad mraquade'* or moroccan salt-preserved lemons (optional)\n* Chives\n* Salt\n* Sugar\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. **The day before** boil the beef tongue with the carrot, the onion, bay leaves, thyme, peppercorn and salt in abundant water, preferably in a pressure cooker. It should take around 50min\/1 hour depending on the size of the piece and the type of pressure cooker you use. In a conventional pot it can take up to 3 hours! If the exterior skin peels easily and you can insert a knife without resistance, it's done.\n2. Peel the exterior skin and firmly wrap the tongue in plastic film. Let it rest in the fridge overnight.\n3. For the pickled mustard seeds, you'll want to add them to a pot with water and bring to a simmer. Discard the liquid, and repeat the process with new water. You will need to do this several times to remove the bitternes from the seeds.\n4. Once you've done this 5 or 6 times (could be more, could be less, just taste the seeds), add white vinegar and water in a 50\/50 proportion just to cover the seeds (which will have grown from the moisture) and two tablespoons of sugar, and bring to a simmer again. Let the liquid reduce and turn into a slightly dense mixture. You can adjust by adding more vinegar if it is too dense or too sweet. You can store in a jar in the fridge for a long time.\n5. For the 'quick-pickled' onion, thinly slice the sweet onion, and mix it with lemon juice and water (50\/50 proportion again), very thin slices of salt-preserved lemons, 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt. (You can add a teaspoon of MSG if you want an extra umami punch, and you can substitute the preserved lemon for normal lemon peel).\n6. Take the tongue out from the fridge. It should be rigid from the collagen getting cold, but its the perfect state for slicing it. Either use an electric slicer or a good knife, the tongue should be very tender if the cooking time is correct.\n7. Serve the tongue slices with the onion and mustard seeds on top, add a bit of the onion pickle juice to season the meat, and decorate with chives.\n\nMany people feel disgusted from the idea of eating tongue but its an extremely soft and flavorful cut, similar to beef cheeks, and an excellent way to respect the meat and get the most out of the animal. Give it a try!",

        "recipe_comment":"Who doesn't like super tender beef in rich tomato-based curry sauce? It melts in the mouth and is super easy to prepare! I have separated the process of cooking as most online recipes call for, this gives more control over meat tenderness and the right consistency of the sauce, just like in the restaurant setting, bringing the best quality to your home cooking :)\n\n**Ingredients for Marinade:**\n\n\\* 500g (1.1Pound) Beef chuck steak diced to 2,5cm cubes (you can use any braising cut if chuck is not available)\n\n\\* 1tbsp of ginger &amp; garlic paste\n\n\\* 1tbsp vegetable oil\n\n\\* 1tsp of salt\n\n\\* 1 lemon juice\n\n\\* 3tbsp of Madras spice blend\n\n**Ingredients for Madras Spice Blend:**\n\n\\* 3tbsp ground coriander\n\n\\* 3tbsp ground cumin\n\n\\* 2tbsp ground turmeric\n\n\\* 2tbsp chilli powder (adjust to your preference)\n\n\\* 2tbsp garam masala\n\n\\* 1tsp black pepper\n\n**Ingredients for the Curry:**\n\n\\* 500g of marinated Beef\n\n\\* enough water to cover the meat during slow-cooking\n\n\\* 2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil\n\n\\* 1 large onion, small dice\n\n\\* 1tbsp of garlic &amp; ginger paste\n\n\\* 3tbsp of Madras spice blend\n\n\\* 400ml of vegetable stock\n\n\\* 4tbsp of tomato puree\n\n\\* juice of a half lemon\n\n\\* 1tsp of sugar\n\n\\* 1 beef stock cube\n\n\\* a handful of fresh coriander leaves and seeds\n\n\\* papadam to serve\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Prepare the Madras spice blend by mixing the ingredients. It will make more than you need for the recipe (you can always add more at the end of cooking to boost the flavour)\n2. Place the beef in the bowl and marinate by mixing all the ingredients from the list with the meat. Place in the fridge overnight.\n3. On the following day, sear the beef in a frying pan over high heat and transfer it to a slow-cooker or a pot (do not over-fry it as it will make your meat dry, you want a nice caramelization on one side of each piece) Add enough hot water to cover the meat and cook covered on low until tender. This can take 2-3 hours depending on the cut used (a slow-cooker can take longer).\n4. In the meantime prepare the sauce. In a medium-sized pan heat 2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil, add diced onion and fry over medium heat until soft and browned.\n5. Add 1tbsp of garlic ginger paste, 3tbsp of Madras spice blend and cook until fragrant.\n6. Add vegetable stock, tomato puree, beef stock cube, 1tsp of sugar and lemon juice. Mix together and bring to a boil. Blend sauce and adjust seasoning to your preference, remove from the heat until needed.\n7. Once the beef is tender and connective tissue has turned into jelly, separate it from the liquid. Add beef to the sauce plus a little bit of the cooking stock.\n8. Continue cooking on low heat until the thick consistency of the sauce is reached.\n9. Serve Beef Madras with fresh coriander seeds and leaves. Crunch with papadam, cucumber raita and onion salad. Enjoy!\n\n**Insight:**\n\n\\- The slow cooker's low setting is approximately 90C (194F). A high setting brings the cooking temperature to around 100C (212F).\n\n\\- Collagen - connective tissue in the meat begins to dissolve into gelatin at a temperature of 70C (160F). Lower cooking temperatures and longer time result in a juicer and tenderer meat.\n\nBlog post: https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/beef-madras-with-coriander-papadam",

Stir the roux into the Goulash to thicken.\n7. Serve with toasted sourdough bread and garnished with freshly chopped parsley. Add chilli for some kick or soured cream to break the flavours. Also delicious to serve over pasta, boiled potatoes or pearl barley. Smacznego!\n\nBlog post: https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/hungarian-goulash",

Then add a generous lump of butter, the garlic and some thyme twigs. Turn down the heat to medium and let the steak fry in the butter\/garlic\/thyme mixture for another minute or 2.

Originating in Hungary, goulash is a common meal predominantly eaten in Central Europe but also in other parts of Europe. It is one of the national dishes of Hungary and a symbol of the country.\n\n**Enjoy the recipe and the** [**latest episode of United Cuisines on Youtube!**](https:\/\/youtu.be\/q6m5z7uF-so)\n\n*INGREDIENTS*\n\n* stewing beef (e.g. shin or chuck) \\[1 lb \/ 450 g\\]\n* butter \\[1 tbsp \/ 20 g\\]\n* onion \\[1 large \/ 170 g\\]\n* caraway seeds \\[1 tsp \/ 2 g\\]\n* Hungarian sweet paprika \\[1.25 tbsp \/ 10 g\\]\n* beef broth \\[2 cups \/ 500 ml\\]\n* diced canned tomatoes \\[1 cup \/ 250 g\\]\n* 2 garlic cloves\n* 1 bay leaf\n* vegetables of your choice (e.g. bell pepper, potatoes, carrots)\n\n*METHOD*\n\n1. Detach the meat from the bone (if you're using shin) and cut it into small cubes of around one inch, or 2 cm. Leave the fat and tissue on\n2. Cut the onion into small cubes, the washed vegetables of choice into bite size pieces\n3. Sprinkle some vegetable oil into a stainless pan and sear the meat over high heat. **Salt the meat right before frying** and don\u2019t overcrowd the pan. Sear from two sides till nicely browned and fond starts building up on the pan\u2019s surface. Transfer the browned meat into a big enough pot, in which you will cook the Goulash, set aside\n4. Reduce the heat of the pan to medium, add the butter and saut\u00e9 the onions for a few minutes\n5. Coarsely ground the caraway seeds in a mortar &amp; pestle ground, make some space in the pan and dry fry (\"wake them up\"), together with the sweet paprika. They should turn fragrant after a minute or so\n6. Combine with the onions and deglaze with a little bit a of beef broth\n7. Scrape the good stuff off the bottom of the pan and mix well before transferring everything into the pot. Add the remainder of the broth, cubed tomatoes, carrots, a bay leaf and crush in the garlic. Put on the lid, reduce the heat to low and let simmer for around 75-90 minutes, occasionally stirring every 15 minutes or so\n8. Add potatoes and peppers around 20 minutes before the meat is expected to get tender, which, depending on the cut, might take up to 3 hours. So best ask you butcher here\n9. Top up with some hot water, if necessary, cover and let cook till the potatoes are done and the meat is fork tender\n10. Season with salt and pepper to taste, turn off the heat and let sit for a few minutes before serving\n11.

        "recipe_comment":"Beef Stroganoff: tasty, creamy and very comforting! Also rather easy-to-make and takes less than 20 minutes to prep.\n\nYou can have it with pasta, mashed potatoes, polenta or even fries. No matter what you serve your Beef Stroganoff with, enjoy!\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n\\- good quality, not too tough cut of beef, such as sirloin or rib-eye \\[10 oz \/ 300 g\\]\n\n\\- vegetable oil \\[1 tbsp \/ 15 ml\\]\n\n\\- butter \\[1 tbsp \/ 15 g\\]\n\n\\- half an onion\n\n\\- button or cremini mushrooms \\[4 oz \/ 120 g\\]\n\n\\- 1 big garlic clove\n\n\\- all purpose flour \\[1 tbsp\\]\n\n\\- beef broth \\[1 cup \/ 250 ml\\]\n\n\\- cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche \\[1\/3 cup \/ 80 g\\]\n\n\\- Dijon mustard \\[2 tsp \/ 10 g\\]\n\n\\- a handful of chopped chives\n\nServings: 2\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Cut the beef into small stripes of approximately 8mm or 1\/3inch in thickness and 3-4 cm, or 1-1.5inch in lenth. Maybe a bit shorter, if you re cooking for children. Slice the mushrooms and roughly chop the onion, too\n2. Over high heat, sprinkle half a tablespoon of vegetable oil into your pan, which should preferably be NOT non-stick, to better sear the meat. Once the pan is really hot, season your meat with salt and pepper and immediately transfer into the pan. DON'T overcrowd the pan and fry stripes for 30-45 seconds. Quickly turn once browned and sear from other side for another 30-45 seconds and set aside on a plate\n3. Once you seared your meat, reduce the heat to medium, and, into the same pan, add a tablespoon of butter and saut\u00e9 the mushrooms and onion in it for approximately 5 minutes\n4. When the mushrooms start to nicely brown, crush in a big garlic clove into the mix and fry together for one minute, or till fragrant\n5. Sprinkle a tablespoon of all purpose flour on top, stir constantly and toast the flour for a minute, before deglazing everything with a cup of beef broth\n6. Add the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, as well as mustard and mix well. Bring to a slight boil, reduce the heat of the pan to low and let simmer for 5-10 minutes, till the sauce reduces to the consistency of your choice\n7. When your gravy's texture is almost right, season it with salt and pepper to taste and bring back the meat and mix it into the gravy. Turn off the heat after a minute, sprinkle a tablespoon of finely chopped chives on your beef Stroganoff and that's it! NOTE: If you got a good, rather tender cut, you don't need to and shouldn't cook the meat in the gravy anymore, for it will overcook and get tough. Whereas, when you get a rather tough cut such as Chuck, you will need to cook it in the gravy for 1-1.5hours\n\n**Enjoy the recipe and** [**our United Cuisines show on YouTube!**](https:\/\/youtu.be\/MF3PSzriNrE)\n\nAlso, you can **support us** on our mission to bring the world closer together **by sharing your favorite dish from your home with us!**",

You can always cook it more or heat a given piece to a higher temperature, but it's *way* too nice of a cut to accidentally ruin. I like to pull mine out when the thickest part is at 115F, and let it cook a bit more while resting.\n9. Let the roast rest in the pan for 10-15 minutes before carving.\n10. Slice into 3\/4-inch thick slices, and plate.\n11. (Optional) Combine the drippings from the roasting pan with a can of au jus, or salted beef broth and serve that along side the sliced roast.

Cook the chuck: Preheat oven to 350\u00baF. Pat the chuck dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Cut the steak into thirds.\n2. Heat the avocado oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the chuck and cook the steak pieces for 4-5 minutes per side until browned all over.\n3. Add the onion the skillet around the steak and continue cooking until the onion softens and begins to turn light golden brown, an additional 5-6 minutes.\n4. Pour in the beef stock and bring to a boil. Add the whole peeled tomatoes, salsa taquera, crushed red pepper, salt, pepper, and brown sugar. Bring to a boil and then turn off the heat.\n5. Cover the beef and transfer to the oven for 3 hours.\n6. Remove the pot from the oven and taste. Turn the oven to 275\u00baF.\n7. Season again to taste with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, and more sugar, if you like. Return to the oven, uncovered, for 1 hour until the beef is completely falling apart. Add more liquid, as necessary, if the beef liquid evaporates too quickly.\n8. Shred the beef and keep warm.\n9. Prepare the cheese grits: Bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Stir in the grits and salt and reduce heat. Stir in the milk. Simmer, stirring often, for 20 minutes until thickened and tender. Stir in the butter, cheddar cheese, paprika, salt, and pepper. Turn off the heat and allow the grits to rest for 5 minutes.\n10. To serve: Divide the cooked grits between plates and pile the beef on top. Garnish with pickled jalape\u00f1os and minced scallions.

I loved the simplicity of the dish and the complexity of the flavour that comes with it. I asked about a few tips of cooking this dish and their secret was to marinate the beef overnight. Back home I tried to recreate this dish and this is the recipe I want to share with you.\n\nThis recipe makes 4 portions\n\nMarinating time: 1 day\n\nCooking time 3,5 hours\n\n**Ingredients for marinade:**\n\n* 500g Diced Beef chuck or other stewing cut\n* half bottle of Burgundy red wine (if not available you can use other red wine too)\n* 1 banana shallot finely diced\n* bunch of fresh thyme, chopped\n* 2 bay leaves\n* 1\/2tsp of black pepper\n\n**Ingredients for stew:**\n\n* 100g of lardons\n* 200g button mushrooms cut in half\n* 15 pearl onions\n* 2 medium carrots cut to half rings\n* half a stick of celery, finely diced\n* 4 garlic cloves\n* 25g of butter\n* 300ml of beef stock\n* extra hot water to be added during cooking (to compensate liquid evaporation)\n* 1tbsp of cornflour dissolved in 2tbsp of water\n* 1tbsp oil\n* Parsley to garnish\n* Boiled potatoes or pasta to serve\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Begin by marinating diced beef. Mix it in a bowl with finely diced shallot, a small bunch of fresh chopped thyme, 2 bay leaves, 1\/2tsp of black pepper and half a bottle of Burgundy red wine. Leave it covered in the fridge overnight.\n2. On the next day, remove the beef pieces from the marinade and pat them dry ready to be seared **(keep the marinade).**\n3. To sear the beef mix it with 1tbsp of oil and pan-fry over high heat to colour the meat on each side (do it in two batches if your pan is small or you preparing a bigger amount).\n4. Add in the marinade liquid with all the bits plus 300ml of beef stock, bring it to the temperature and **simmer for 2,5 hours** (during that time the liquid will evaporate so keep adding more water to keep the meat almost covered).\n5. In the meantime prepare bacon and vegetables. In a separate pan, fry bacon lardons until the fat have rendered out, then add the mushrooms and fry until they start to brown. Next, add pearl onions with 25g of butter. Once melted add carrots and celery. Once browned transfer everything onto a plate ready for later.\n6. **After 2,5 hours** beef will start to tenderise, at this point add bacon with vegetables and simmer for **1 more hour** (**during that time the liquid should reduce by half**).\n7. Once Beef Bourguignon is ready you can thicken the sauce if needed with 1tbsp of cornflour dissolved in 2tbsp of water. Don't forget to check and adjust the seasoning.\n8. Serve over buttery boiled potatoes or pasta.\n\nBlog post with video: [https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/beef-bourguignon](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/beef-bourguignon)",

I grew up eating my grandma's Chinese version, and it's truly one of the easiest yet richest meals you could enjoy: it's fragrant from spices like star anise, cloves, and ginger, and has meat that's fall-off-the-bone tender, and what may be the best thing about this version is that it's quick and easy to make in an Instant Pot! While this stew could take 3-5 hours with constant nursing on the stove, the Instant Pot allows you to pressure cook this comforting Chinese stew in just 45 min!\n\nTo watch a step-by-step video on how to make this: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3eKUBpxEDB0](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3eKUBpxEDB0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Chinese Oxtail Stew recipe**  \n*Ingredients:* \n\n* 1 Tbsp neutral oil \n* 3.5-4 lb oxtails, trimmed and de-fatted\n* 6 whole cloves \n* 4 whole star anise\n* 3 bay leaves\n* 1 inch piece ginger, sliced and smashed \n* 7-8 garlic cloves, smashed \n* 2 tsp sugar (or rock sugar) \n* 2 Tbsp dark soy sauce \n* 3 Tbsp light soy sauce \n* 1\/2 C shaoxing wine (or dry sherry) \n* 1.5 C water \n\n*Directions:* \n\n1. Turn Instant Pot on \"saute\" mode and add 1 Tbsp oil to the pot. Allow to heat up. Then, add oxtails in groups so that you brown \\*all\\* sides of the oxtails. More browning = more flavor! \n2. Once all oxtails are browned on all sides, turn \"saute\" mode off and pour out any excess oil from the pot. Turn \"saute\" mode on again, and add the cloves, star anise, bay leaves, ginger, and garlic cloves. Saute until the spices are fragrant and the garlic\/ginger have browned a bit. \n3. Add in remaining ingredients (sugar, soy sauces, wine, and water) to the pot. Stir to combine. Then, add in all the browned oxtails. Turn saute mode off. \n4. Put lid on Instant Pot, switch to High Pressure mode,  and set timer for 45 min to pressure cook. Make sure the knob is set to \"sealing.\" \n5. Once 45 min is up, allow pot to naturally release, then open the pot. Switch the mode to \"saute\" and allow the oxtail sauce to reduce until it can coat the back of a spoon. \n6. Season to taste with salt\/pepper. Garnish with chopped scallions and cilantro, serve with steaming hot rice, and enjoy.",

In the meantime jump to dumplings.\n\n**4.** When the meat is almost ready, add diced carrots and continue cooking for another **30 minutes**.\n\n**5.** Once the meat is tender, saute diced mushrooms to brown all around and season with salt when almost ready, add to the master pot along with the cream.\n\n**6.** Use the same frying pan to melt **1,5tbsp** of butter then add **1tbsp** of plain flour, once combined, cook on medium heat for around a minute then stir into the master pot to thicken the sauce.\n\n**7.** Finish the sauce by adding fresh chopped dill and **1tbsp** of yoghurt, balance the flavour by adding **1tsp** of sugar and salt and black pepper to your liking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instructions for the dumplings:**\n\n**1.** Begin by boiling potatoes in salty water until ready for mashing.\n\n**2.** Mash potatoes until smooth, I recommend using a potato ricer as this has a direct impact on the texture of your dumplings.\n\n**3.** Once the dough is combined divide it into two parts and roll each part on the surface with your hands into the size of a rolling pin \n\n**4.** After **30min - 1hours** potatoes should be ready to work with, place them together in a bowl and add **250g** of potato flour\/starch and **2** eggs.

Roll each piece in hands to a ball shape then make a dip with your knuckle. Place each dumpling on a cloth ready for boiling.\n\n**7.** To boil dumplings use a pot of slightly salty water, once you add them in, give it a stir and wait until they float to the top, from that moment begin the count to **3-4 minutes** and remove them from the water on to a plate, add butter to coat and serve with the sauce garnished with fresh dill and gherkins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Insight:**\n\n* Adding egg to Silesian dumplings depends on the variety of potatoes used, their dryness and temperature of the mashed potatoes. Some recipes don't use it at all.\n* Beef Stroganoff originated in Russia and spread quickly throughout the world, bringing additional ingredients like mushrooms, mustard or tomatoes.\n* In Poland, gherkins are served with the dish or added to it in the last stages of cooking.",

Broccoli should not be raw but still a little snappy.\n5. Transfer broccoli to a bowl and add oil to the skillet. Add steak in a single layer and season liberally with pepper. Cook for about 1-2 minutes per side or until no longer pink.\n6. Add sauce to the skillet and bring to a simmer. As soon as it bubbles, reduce heat to low and let thicken, about 1-2 minutes. Add broccoli and toss with the steak until everything is coated. if sauce gets too thick add a little warm water. Top with green onion and sesame seeds. Serve over white rice.\n\nRecipe\/post: [https:\/\/kitchenswagger.com\/beef-and-broccoli-recipe\/](https:\/\/kitchenswagger.com\/beef-and-broccoli-recipe\/)",

        "recipe_comment":"Here is the full recipe:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n150g fresh, good quality beef for tartare (ask your butcher what they recommend)\n\n2 eggs (1 at room temperature, for the mayo)\n\n3-4 tbsp soy sauce\n\n1\/2 carrot\n\nSmall bunch of chives\n\nMustard 1 tsp: you'll need half for the mayo and half for the vinaigrette\n\nHazelnut oil, about 1-2 tbsp\n\n1 orange: half of it zested, and 1\/4 juiced\n\nVegetable oil, about 300g (but more if you like your mayo thicker)\n\n1 tsp brined peppercorns\n\n\\[+ a few slices of toasted sourdough\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. To make the cured yolk, crack the egg open, remove the yolk and add it to the soy sauce. Leave it to cure in the soy sauce until you plate up.\n2. Now, off to the mayo. The quickest and easiest way to make mayo is with a hand blender. Add the whole egg (at room temperature) to a bowl, add salt, oil, the chives and half of the mustard.\n3. Blend, slowly, from the bottom to the top, until emulsified. If it's not thick enough, add more oil and repeat the process. It takes one or two minutes. So, so easy!\n4. Peel the carrot, then dice it into tiny little cubes, a.k.a. brunoise.\n5. Add the carrot to a mixing bowl.\n6. Dice the meat. I don't know how you like your beef tartare, but I like mine to still have a bite. My butcher asked me if I wanted it minced, that's a no go for me. This is also why I like to freeze it some 20-30 minutes before I cut it. That helps me cut it into nice and evenly. Try that!\n7. Add the beef to the bowl with the carrots.\n8. Zest the orange. As much as you like. I adore zest, so I always add a lot.\n9. For the vinaigrette: add some hazelnut oil to a small jar, squeeze some orange juice, season, add the remaining mustard and shake. Mustard is a surfactant, meaning that it helps molecules of fat and water bind - i.e., it emulsifies the vinaigrette.\n10. Add it to the beef and carrot, and mix well.\n11. Plate up and enjoy with a few slices of toasted sourdough.",

        "recipe_comment":"Reganmian is a traditional Chinese dish where noodles are served with flavourful beef stock - lou mei and other garnishes like crushed peanuts, pickled carrots or beans, sesame sauce, soy sauce, fresh garlic, chilli oil, coriander and scallions.\n\nNoodles are the main element of this dish so making fresh is the best way to go. My favourite is Udon, easy to make and tastes fantastic, I bet you will enjoy it as much as I did at the moment when everything mixes together and you take the first bite.\n\nYou don't have to add all of the toppings to make it delicious. Instead of chilli oil, I used my homemade chilli sauce and it worked great. I also pickled carrot with my quick hot pickle.\n\n**Ingredients for Udon:**\n\n* 500g (17.6oz) of plain flour\n* 250g (8.8oz) of warm water\n* 20g (0.7oz) of salt\n* cornstarch for dusting\n\n**Ingredients for lou mei:**\n\n* 400ml (0.42quarts) of beef or stock\n* 3tbsp sesame oil\n* 20g (0.7oz) of fresh ginger peeled and sliced\n* 3 garlic cloves peeled and sliced\n* 1 small shallot sliced\n* 1spring onion sliced\n* 3tbsp Shaoxing wine\n* 1tbsp brown sugar\n\n**Spices for lou mei:**\n\n* 2 small cinnamon sticks\n* 3 bay leaves\n* 10 peppercorns\n* 20 fennel seeds\n* 10 cloves\n* 5 cardamon pods\n* 3 star anise\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Instructions for Noodles (4 portions) :**\n\n**1.** Dissolve the salt in warm water and mix into the flour, knead for **8 minutes** until a smooth dough ball is formed (it may be hard at the beginning but it will soften as gluten forms) Then rest it covered to prevent drying for **30 minutes**.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**2.** After resting it is time for final kneading and the easiest way to get it done is by placing the dough in a plastic bag and stepping on it until it spreads out then folding it into a ball again and repeating this two more times. You can also roll it with a pin but it is a lot harder to do so. After you finish rest the dough for at least **2 hours or overnight**.\n\n**3.** Roll the dough flat to **1\/4 of an inch** then fold it on itself and slice equal noodles.\n\n**4.** Boil the noodles in salty water for **12 minutes** (do it in 3 batches) then run them  under cold water to set the starch on the outer surface (this makes them silkier and prevents from sticking)\n\n**5.** To serve the noodles, deep them in boiling water for **15 seconds** then place in the bowl, add a small ladle of lou mei and garnish with other toppings.\n\n**Instructions for Lou mei:**\n\n**1.** Heat **3tbsp of sesame oil** in a medium pan then add, garlic, ginger and onion. Fry for couple minutes then add seven spices, fry for another couple minutes to release the aroma.\n\n**2.** Add Shaoxing wine, beef stock and brown sugar then simmer for about **30-60 minutes.**\n\n**3.** Once ready you can store in the fridge for up to 4 days.\n\n **Quick Pickled Carrot:**\n\n* 100g (3.5oz) carrot, peeled and chopped into matchsticks\n* 100ml (0.1quarts) of red wine vinegar\n* 50g (1.8oz) of brown sugar\n\nCombine vinegar and sugar then bring to boil and remove from the heat, add carrot matchsticks and make sure it is submerged. After 15 minutes the pickle is ready, you can store it in the fridge for future use.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7  \n**Homemade Chilli sauce:**\n\n* 5 chillis (green or red) seeds removed\n* 20g (0.7oz) of ginger, peeled and diced\n* 8tbsp of chopped tomato\n* 1\/2 lime juice\n* 1\/2 tsp sugar\n* 1\/2 tsp salt\n* 4tbsp rapeseed oil\n\nBlend everything together in a food processor, it makes more than you need for this recipe so you can store it for the future in the fridge.\n\nBlog post with more photos: [https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/homemade-hot-dry-noodles](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/homemade-hot-dry-noodles)",

        "recipe_comment":"I love slow-cooking, it is magical how it changes a relatively cheap cut of meat into delicious food! For this recipe, I used beef shin but any part high in connective tissue will work as well. I Mixed this juicy meat with sweet peppers, fresh parsley and pan-fried it in the crunchy tortilla with gooey cheese. Bring your favourite toppings and you are good to go!\n\n**Ingredients for 4 portions:**\n\n* 400g of the diced beef shin (or other cuts high in connective tissue)\n* 150g of mozzarella or Oaxaca cheese, asadero cheese, manchego cheese, Chihuahua if available\n* 1 medium onion roughly chopped\n* 2 garlic cloves minced\n* 1tsp mild chilli powder\n* 1tsp ground cumin\n* 1tsp marjoram or oregano\n* 2tsp paprika\n* 500ml of beef or vegetable stock\n* 200g sweet peppers, seeds removed and sliced\n* 1tbsp tomato paste\n* 5g chopped parsley\n* 1tsp of salt\n* 4 medium-size wraps (20cm (8inch) diameter)\n* olive oil\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**1.** Marinate the beef in cumin, paprika, chilli powder, marjoram, garlic and 2tbsp of olive oil, you can do it on the previous day or at least 30 minutes before cooking.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**2.** Fry the meat with onions on the high heat to colour and transfer to the slow cooker (you can use a pot or leave it in the same pan as well) add stock to cover the meat and add one tsp of salt. Set the slow cooker on high setting for 3-4 hours.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**3.** Meanwhile, fry the peppers on medium heat for around 10 minutes and set aside for later.\n\n**4.** When the meat is tender remove from the slow cooker and allow to cool a little bit in the cooking juices then remove from the liquid and brake it with your fingers. Mix with peppers, chopped parsley, tomato puree and some of the cooking juices.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**5.** Brush one side of tortilla with some olive oil and place it down on the heated frying pan, add cheese to one side and top with the meat, once tortilla is golden-brown fold and flatten slightly.\n\n**6.** Remove from the pan and cut in half before serving, enjoy!\n\nInsight:\n\n* Meat surface browning intensifies the flavour thanks to Millard reactions. In the process, carbohydrates react with amino acids creating hundreds of delicious compounds.\n* At a temperature of 70C (158F) connective tissue collagen begins to dissolve into gelatin making meat significantly more tender.\n\nBlog post with photos: [https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/mexican-slow-cooked-chilli-beef-quesadilla](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/mexican-slow-cooked-chilli-beef-quesadilla)",

        "recipe_comment":"## Recipe here originally: [Spicy Beef Stew with Carrots and Tomatoes](http:\/\/triedtrue.us\/BeefStewCarrotsTomatoes)\n\nThis spicy beef stew with carrots and tomatoes is the perfect comfort meal for chilly days.\n\nCook Time: 2 hours \n\nInactive Time: 1 hour 30 minutes \n\nServings: 6 \n\nCalories: 366kcal \n\nAuthor: Kylie Perrotti\n\n### Equipment\n\n* Wide braising pot or soup pot\n* Food processor\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 1 tablespoon neutral cooking oil\n* 2 pounds chuck roast cut into cubes\n* 4 celery stalks a few leaves reserved for garnish\n* 2 medium onions peeled\n* 2 tablespoons harissa paste\n* 1 tablespoon tomato paste\n* 1\/4 cup flour\n* 4 large carrots trimmed, scrubbed and cut into thirds\n* 3-4 cups beef stock\n* 1 28- ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes\n* 2 teaspoons ground turmeric\n* 1 teaspoon cumin\n* 1 teaspoon paprika\n* 1 teaspoon ground ginger\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* Cayenne powder to taste\n* \u00bd teaspoon celery salt\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Heavy cream optional, for serving\n* Olive oil for browning the beef\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Prepare the Aromatics:\n\n* Add the onion and celery stalks (with leaves) to a food processor and pulse until roughly chopped.\u00a0Remove some additional celery leaves from the stalk and mince and reserve for garnish.\u00a0\n\n#### Brown the beef:\n\n* Pat the beef dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed soup pot or braising pan. Once very hot, brown the beef in batches. Cook the beef cubes for 3-5 minutes on each side until well browned and crisping up around the edges.\u00a0*Note: If there seems to be a lot of excess oil in the pot, you can drain it off, but don\u2019t remove anything stuck to the bottom of the skillet.*\n\n#### Start the Stew:\n\n* Add the celery and onions to the hot pot and cook for 5 minutes or until softened. Add the harissa paste and tomato paste and cook for 3-5 minutes or until the paste starts to turn a deeper red color. Add the flour and stir to coat everything in the pot and cook for 1 minute more.\n* Add the beef stock and reduce heat to medium low and whisk continuously until the flour is completely incorporated into the liquid and the broth is smooth. Add the can of tomatoes and their liquid.\n* Add the cumin,\u00a0paprika, ground ginger, garlic powder, cayenne powder to taste and celery salt. Season with salt and pepper.\n* Carefully add the beef and the carrots and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and cook for at least 1 hour 30 minutes, stirring occasionally throughout cooking.\n\n#### Finish the Stew:\n\n* Taste the stew and season to your liking. Use a spoon to lightly mash some of the tomatoes to break them up a bit.\n\n#### Shred the Beef:\n\n* Remove the beef cubes from the pot and transfer to a bowl and lightly shred the meat and return it back to the pot.\u00a0*Note: You do not have to completely shred the beef; simply break apart some of the cubes. You will want a mix of some shredded and some cubed beef throughout the stew.*\n\n#### To Serve:\n\n* Ladle a few spoonfuls of the stew between bowls. Sprinkle a few minced celery leaves on top and drizzle with heavy cream, if desired.

In a large bowl, place the short ribs and fill with cold water to draw out excess blood from the meat. Let sit for about 30 minutes, switching the water every 10 minutes\n* In a large pot, add onion, garlic, ginger, and water, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the short ribs and boil for 10 minutes, skimming off any foam that forms on the surface\n* Remove ribs from broth and set aside. Pour the broth through a strainer into a bowl to remove the solids. Place the broth into the refrigerator for 30 minutes to let the fat rise to the surface\n* In the meantime, prepare the braising sauce. Start by grating the apple, onion, and ginger into a bowl, then add the remaining sauce ingredients and mix well until the sugar fully dissolves\n* After the broth has been in the fridge for 30 minutes, you should see a layer of fat starting to form on the surface. Do your best and use a spoon to skim off this layer of fat. (Alternatively, you can pause at this step and leave the broth overnight in the fridge. This will ensure that the fat solidifies in a layer at the top of the broth, making it extremely easy to remove)\n* Place the ribs and braising liquid back into the large pot and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, flipping the ribs a few times\n* Pour the broth in and cover the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 45 minutes\n* In the meantime, prepare the vegetables. Cut the potato, radish, and carrots into 1 inch pieces\n* After 45 minutes, add the prepared radish and carrots to the pot. Make sure that they are mostly submerged in the liquid. After cooking for another 10 minutes, add the potatoes. Cook covered for another 20 minutes\n* At this point, the rib meat should be extremely tender. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready when you can easily pierce the meat with a chopstick. If you want the meat to be more tender, keep cooking covered until it reaches the desired tenderness\n* Remove the lid and raise the heat back to medium. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the sauce has reduced and thickened to your liking. Remove from pot and serve immediately. Enjoy!",

I set it and forget it.\ud83d\udc4d The thermometer in the meat tells me what the internal temperature of the meat is throughout the cook. The clip by the top right of the pan is a thermometer the computer uses to know what the current cooking temperature is during the cook. If it goes below 225\u00b0 the computer turns on a fan to feed the lump coal my Air. The computer will notify me when to meat reaches 200\u00b0f.",

Wash and clean 2lb beef. Turn on the high heat and boil the beef in cold water. Add 4-5 ginger slices and 1oz Chinese cooking wine. Turn down the heat to medium when boiling. Boil for 15 min and get rid of beef scum.\n2. Dump the water and let the beef cool down. Cut it into cubes.\n3. Chop a half onion and prepare dry spices.\n4. In a big pot, stir fry dry spices in 3 tbsps oil in medium heat for 2 min. Then stir fry chopped onions for 2 min. Add beef and stir fry for 2 minutes. Then add chili bean paste and stir fry everything for 2 minutes.\n5. In the same pot, add 1.2L boiling water, 2 tbsps soy sauce, 1 tbsp dark soy sauce, 3g salt. Simmer for 2 hours in low heat.\n\nHand pulled noodles:\n\n1. Mix flour, salt and water together to make a dough. The ratio of flour to water is 1:0.6. Rest for 30 minutes.\n2. After resting, knead the dough for 2 minutes, and rest for another 30 min.\n3. Brush some oil on the work surface, roll out the dough to 0.5 inch thick. Brush more oil on both sides to keep its moisture, cover it with a plastic wrapper. Rest for 2-3 hours.\n4. Cut the dough into 0.5 inch strips. Stretch and slap the noodle on the work surface.\n5. Boil the fresh noodles for 1.5 min. Boil some baby bok choy for 30 seconds.\n6. Add chopped garlic and green onions to finish off the perfect bowl of braised beef noodle soup!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. Resting the dough is the key of making hand pulled noodles. The dough will develop gluten by itself and become elastic.\n2. Salt not only provides flavor, but also strengthens gluten bonding.\n3. Slapping the noodle on the work surface can help it stretch evenly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis dish is super delicious and well-balanced. The noodle is chewy, beef is soft and savory, the broth is steaming hot and packed with flavors. It looks time-consuming, but mostly you just need to wait for the soup to gain flavors and for the dough to form gluten. It is not hard work, and the payoff is absolutely worth it!",

        "recipe_comment":"**Ingredients for 5 portions:**\n\n1.1 lbs Pork shoulder minced (500g) you can use turkey instead\n\n* 4 Bacon slices\n* 2 Sweetheart Cabbage or 1 Savoy Cabbage\n* 1.5 cups Vegetable broth (375ml) Poultry broth works as well\n* 3 Medium onions finely diced\n* 1 tbsp Vegetable oil\n* 2 tbsp Breadcrumbs\n* 0.44 lbs Long grain rice (200g) this yields about 1.3 lbs or 600g when cooked; pearl barley is a good substitute as well\n* 2 tsp Salt (12g)\n* 1 tsp Black pepper\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.Cook the rice, then drain and mix with the minced meat. In a pan, saut\u00e9 the onions in oil until they turn golden. Add to the meat and rice mixture. Incorporate salt, pepper, and breadcrumbs. Combine thoroughly.\n\n2.Prepare large pot, pour water up to 1\/3 of its height and boil it.\n\n* **For Sweetheart or Savoy Cabbage:** Simply blanch the leaves in boiling water for 2 minutes. Trim the thick nerve in the middle of each leaf.\n* **For White Cabbage:** Removing the hardest part of the stem with a knife. Place the cabbage in boiling water, after two minutes, turn the leaves upside down and wait for another 2-3 minutes before removing. You can start rolling while waiting for the cabbage. Reserve the smallest leaves and core part for laying the baking dish.\n\n3.Make a ball of meat &amp; rice stuffing in your hands and transfer it to a leaf. Place it at the bottom part of the leaf. Fold the leaf sides toward the centre. Roll the cabbage roll tightly. Roll all cabbage rolls until you run out of stuffing.\n\n**4.**\n\n* **For the stovetop method:** Using the pot previously employed for blanching the cabbage, layer the bottom with bacon slices followed by smaller cabbage leaves. Position the rolls on top, add the broth, cover the pot, and allow it to simmer gently for approximately 1.5 hours.\n* **Oven-baked method:** In a Dutch oven or another oven-safe dish, arrange bacon slices and small leftover cabbage leaves at the base. Position the rolls snugly next to each other. After covering, bake in an oven that's been preheated to 180\u00b0C (356\u00b0F) for 50 minutes. Then, uncover the dish, drizzle your preferred sauce (either tomato or mushroom) over the rolls, and continue baking for an additional 20 minutes.\n* **Slow-cooker method:** In your slow cooker, begin by layering bacon slices and smaller cabbage leaves. Add a thin coating of tomato sauce to avoid the Go\u0142\u0105bki sticking, then systematically layer the Go\u0142\u0105bki, covering them with the remaining sauce and topping with additional cabbage leaves. Set to cook on low for 6 hours or, if short on time, on high for 3 hours. When finished, exercise caution when removing the tender Go\u0142\u0105bki.\n\n**5.** Serve the cabbage rolls immediately after cooking. Sprinkle with freshly chopped dill, parsley or ton of black pepper, serve with you favourite sauce.

Flip and cook an additional 5 minutes until golden brown. Do not overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if needed. Transfer the pork chops to a plate.\n\n**Cook the pears:**\n\n1. Add the pears and shallots to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes per side until the pears are golden brown all over. Season lightly with salt and pepper to taste. Pour the sauce over the pears and toss gently to coat. Turn off the heat and nestle the pork chops into the pears.\n\n**Bake:**\n\n1. Transfer the skillet or braising pot to the oven and bake for about 15 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 140\u00ba-145\u00baF at the thickest part of the chop. (Note: Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the chop; begin checking the internal temperature after 10 minutes in the oven)\n2. Rest the pork chops and finish the dish: Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the pork chops to a plate to rest for 5 minutes.\n\n**Cook the Spinach:**\n\n1. Meanwhile, carefully stir the spinach into the pears until wilted. If necessary, put the skillet on low heat on the stove, but the skillet should be warm enough that the spinach wilts with no additional heat. Taste and season to your preference with salt and pepper.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the pears and spinach between plates and place a pork chop on top. Spoon more sauce over the entire dish. Enjoy!",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally:** [**Pork Chops with Mushroom-Scallion Risotto**](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/pork-chops-with-mushroom-scallion-risotto\/)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and thinly sliced\n* 4 tablespoons butter, divided\n* 5 scallions, minced; white and green parts kept separate\n* 1 cup carnaroli or arborio rice\n* 6 cups warm water or chicken stock\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n* 1 pound broccoli, cut into florets\n* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning\n* \u00be cup finely grated Parmesan cheese\n* \u00bd lemon, juiced\n* 4 boneless, thick-sliced center-cut pork chops (1 pound total)\n* Freshly minced parsley, optional, for serving\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Prepare the risotto:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 425\u00baF.\n2. Turn the heat on a large pot to medium. Add the mushrooms and cook, occasionally turning as they release water. The water will evaporate over 8\u201310 minutes. Once the water from the mushrooms evaporates, turn the heat to medium-high and add 2 tablespoons of butter. Cook for 4-5 minutes until they brown and crisp up around the edges. Add salt and pepper.\n3. Add the scallion whites to the mushrooms. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the carnaroli rice and cook for 1\u20132 minutes. Add a pinch of salt. *\\*See Note*\n4. Begin ladling in the warm water or stock, 1 cup at a time. Stir after each addition and only add more liquid once the rice absorbs the liquid in the pot. Continue adding the liquid until 5 cups have been incorporated. Taste the risotto to see if the rice is tender. The liquid in the pot should be creamy. Add the remaining 1 cup of water only if needed and stir after adding it. Taste and add salt and pepper. This process will take 20\u201325 minutes.\n5. Once the rice is tender, turn off the heat. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, half of the minced scallion greens, and the Parmesan cheese until melted. Add the lemon juice. Taste and season once more.\n\n**Roast the broccoli:**\n\n1. Arrange the broccoli florets on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.\n2. As soon as you add the carnaroli rice to the pot for the risotto, transfer the broccoli to the oven. Roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover with foil. Keep warm and keep the oven heated to 425\u00baF.\n\n**Cook the pork chops:**\n\n1. Pat the pork chops dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops and cook for 3\u20134 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven for 15\u201317 minutes. Once the pork chops reach 140\u00baF, remove them from the oven and rest on a cutting board for 5\u201310 minutes.\n3. Slice the pork chops thinly and arrange on a serving platter with the roasted broccoli.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the risotto into shallow bowls. Arrange the sliced pork chop on top and serve with the broccoli on the side. Garnish with freshly minced parsley and the remaining minced scallion greens. Enjoy!\n\nNotes:\n\nContinue with roasting the broccoli and the pork chops as you cook the risotto. While you should stir the risotto regularly, you can take breaks periodically to roast the broccoli and fry up the pork chops. It just requires a bit of multitasking!",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally: [XO Noodles with Pork](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/xo-noodles-with-pork\/)**\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 pound ground pork\n* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce\n* 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine\n* 1 teaspoon sugar\n* 12 ounces chow mein or lo mein noodles\n* 1 shallot, peeled and thinly sliced\n* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 1-inch piece of ginger, peeled and minced\n* 3 Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced\n* 4 scallions, trimmed and minced\n* 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, caps thinly sliced; stems discarded or saved or stock\n* 4 cups shredded Napa cabbage, cored and shredded\n* 2 cups grated carrots\n* 2 teaspoons sesame oil\n* 2 heaping tablespoons XO sauce\n* \u00bd cup water or chicken stock\n* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce\n* 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine\n* 1 teaspoon cornstarch\n* Crispy shallots, optional, for garnish\n* 2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced into long slivers, optional, for garnish\n* Neutral oil, as needed\n\n**Brown the pork:**\n\n1. Turn the heat on a skillet to medium-high. Add the pork and cook, breaking it up as it cooks, for 12\u201315 minutes until nicely browned. Continue cooking until the pork deepens in color and crisps up around the edges. You want crispy bits!\n2. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the skillet.\n3. Mix together 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine, and sugar. Pour the mixture into the pork. Bring to a boil and cook for 2\u20133 minutes, lifting up anything stuck to the bottom. Transfer the pork to a large bowl.\n\n**Cook the noodles:**\n\n1. While the pork browns, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain, rinse, and set aside.\n\n**Cook the aromatics:**\n\n1. Keep the heat on the skillet at medium-high. Add the shallot, garlic, ginger, Thai chili peppers, and minced scallions. Saut\u00e9 for 1\u20132 minutes until fragrant. Transfer to the bowl of pork.\n\n**Cook the mushrooms:**\n\n1. If needed, add a touch of oil. Add the mushrooms to the skillet and saut\u00e9 them for 5\u20136 minutes over medium-high heat. Be careful with shiitakes. They have a lower water content than other mushrooms and can dry out very quickly! Once lightly golden brown, transfer the mushrooms to the bowl of pork.\n\n**Cook the cabbage and carrots:**\n\n1. Add the cabbage and carrots (in batches, if needed) to the skillet. Saut\u00e9 over medium-high heat until the cabbage wilts and the carrots soften about 5\u20136 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Transfer the cabbage and carrots to the bowl of pork.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. Add 2 teaspoons of sesame oil to the skillet. Add the XO sauce and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the water, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine. Bring to a boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.\n2. Scoop out a tablespoon or so of the sauce. Whisk it together with the cornstarch until a slurry forms.\n3. Return the cornstarch mixture to the sauce and stir to incorporate. Continue simmering for 3\u20135 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed. If you like saucier noodles, add more water, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine in 3:1:1 proportions. You may need more cornstarch to thicken it if you add more liquid. You can also add more XO sauce for an even richer sauce.\n\n**Finish the noodles:**\n\n1. Add the noodles to the skillet along with all but a few tablespoons of the pork mixture. Toss to combine over low heat until the noodles are warmed through, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Don\u2019t let them cook on the heat too long! Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the noodles between shallow bowls. Spoon a bit more of the pork and veggie mixture on each dish. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions and crispy shallots if you like. Enjoy!",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally:** [**XO Noodles with Pork Recipe**](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/xo-noodles-with-pork\/) \n\nEquipment\n\n* Large skillet or wok\n* Large pot\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 1 pound ground pork\n* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce\n* 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine\n* 1 teaspoon sugar\n* 12 ounces chow mein or lo mein noodles\n* 1 shallot, peeled and thinly sliced\n* 5 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 1-inch piece of ginger, peeled and minced\n* 3 Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced\n* 4 scallions, trimmed and minced\n* 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, caps thinly sliced; stems discarded or saved or stock\n* 4 cups shredded Napa cabbage, cored and shredded\n* 2 cups grated carrots\n* 2 teaspoons sesame oil\n* 2 heaping tablespoons XO sauce\n* \u00bd cup water or chicken stock\n* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce\n* 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine\n* 1 teaspoon cornstarch\n* Crispy shallots, optional, for garnish\n* 2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced into long slivers, optional, for garnish\n* Neutral oil, as needed\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Brown the pork:\n\n1. Turn the heat on a skillet to medium-high. Add the pork and cook, breaking it up as it cooks, for 12\u201315 minutes until nicely browned. Continue cooking until the pork deepens in color and crisps up around the edges. You want crispy bits!\n2. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the skillet.\n3. Mix together 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine, and sugar. Pour the mixture into the pork. Bring to a boil and cook for 2\u20133 minutes, lifting up anything stuck to the bottom. Transfer the pork to a large bowl.\n\n#### Cook the noodles:\n\n1. While the pork browns, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain, rinse, and set aside.\n\n#### Cook the aromatics:\n\n1. Keep the heat on the skillet at medium-high. Add the shallot, garlic, ginger, Thai chili peppers, and minced scallions. Saut\u00e9 for 1\u20132 minutes until fragrant. Transfer to the bowl of pork.\n\n#### Cook the mushrooms:\n\n1. If needed, add a touch of oil. Add the mushrooms to the skillet and saut\u00e9 them for 5\u20136 minutes over medium-high heat. Be careful with shiitakes. They have a lower water content than other mushrooms and can dry out very quickly! Once lightly golden brown, transfer the mushrooms to the bowl of pork.\n\n#### Cook the cabbage and carrots:\n\n1. Add the cabbage and carrots (in batches, if needed) to the skillet. Saut\u00e9 over medium-high heat until the cabbage wilts and the carrots soften about 5\u20136 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Transfer the cabbage and carrots to the bowl of pork.\n\n#### Prepare the sauce:\n\n1. Add 2 teaspoons of sesame oil to the skillet. Add the XO sauce and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the water, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine. Bring to a boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.\n2. Scoop out a tablespoon or so of the sauce. Whisk it together with the cornstarch until a slurry forms.\n3. Return the cornstarch mixture to the sauce and stir to incorporate. Continue simmering for 3\u20135 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed. If you like saucier noodles, add more water, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine in 3:1:1 proportions. You may need more cornstarch to thicken it if you add more liquid. You can also add more XO sauce for an even richer sauce.\n\n#### Finish the noodles:\n\n1. Add the noodles to the skillet along with all but a few tablespoons of the pork mixture. Toss to combine over low heat until the noodles are warmed through, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Don\u2019t let them cook on the heat too long! Turn off the heat.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n1. Divide the noodles between shallow bowls. Spoon a bit more of the pork and veggie mixture on each dish. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions and crispy shallots if you like. Enjoy!",

Mix the warm milk with the yeast from the banh bao package. Let it sit and work its magic for 10 minutes. If you are using a stand mixer you can add these ingredients to the mixer bowl.\n2. Once the yeast has worked its magic add oil and vinegar and add the mixer attachment. In a medium-sized bowl mix the dry ingredients together, the flour, sugar and salt.\n3. Swap the attachment to the dough hook and add the dry ingredients and mix on low first and gradually increase the speed to medium-low. I let it work the dough until it's well mixed. Roughly 2 minutes. Avoid over-kneading in the mixer to create a light and fluffy bao.\n4. Add a small pinch of flour to a clean surface. Take the dough out of the bowl and use your hands to knead the dough using the palm of your hands. Continues until the dough is nice and smooth. Let it sit for 1 hour to allow it to rise. Best to place it somewhere warm.\n\n**Prepare the pork filling, quail eggs and Chinese sausage**\n\n1. Boil the quail eggs until they are cooked and peel. Set aside.\n2. Take 2 sausages and slice them at an angle to get a nice oval-shaped sausage. I cut them roughly 1\/8 inch. Set aside.\n3. Take the ground pork, add the wood ear mushrooms, onion, sesame oil, fish sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, salt and black pepper. Mix it well and set aside to marinade for about 10 minutes.\n4. Portion out 12 pork fillings and roll them into a ball and set aside.\n\n**Assembling the bao**\n\n1. Once the dough has doubled in size take the dough and divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Use a scale to portion out evenly.\n2. Using a rolling pin to roll out a circle roughly 3.5-4 inches wide. Place the pork filling, quail egg and 2-3 slices of Chinese sausage in the center.\n3. Two ways to pleat the bao:\n\n***Method 1 (more work but looks cute)***\n\n1. Using your primary hand form a small fold with your thumb and index finger. Hold the fold and using your opposite hand place your thumb underneath and your index finger on top and push the dough towards the fold to form the second pleat. You are looking to make an accordion fold. Continue forming these pleats while at the same time rotating the bao until you reach the end.\n2. There will likely be a hole at the top. Using both hands gently close the hole by squeezing it close.\n3. Give it a gentle twirl and that\u2019s it!\n4. Place on top of parchment paper square.\n\n***Method 2 (quick and easy but not as pretty)***\n\n1. Grab the opposite ends and bring the dough together over the filling.\n2. On the opposite sides that bring the other sides over. It\u2019s like wrapping the filling up\n3. Using both hands seal the center, making sure there are no openings.\n4. Place the bao on top of parchment paper square .\n\n**Steaming**\n\n1. Prepare the steamer by adding water and \u00bd cup white vinegar. Make sure to add enough water to steam multiple batches if your steamer is smaller. I steam in 2 batches.\n2. Once the water is boiling turn the heat to medium-high and add the baos. Steam for 20 minutes per batch.\n\n**Note:** Using premix Banh Bao flour yields fluffy bao. I also have a homemade dough recipe which can be found on the link above if you are not able to find the premix flour in the store.",

Once the oil is hot enough add the garlic and shallots and fry until light golden brown.\n3. Add the pork riblets and cook until there is a light golden color on all sides. I do this for about 6-7 minutes. This will vary depending on your stove.\n4. Add the dark soy sauce, regular soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, rice vinegar, Chinese cooking wine and water. Turn the heat to simmer on medium-low and cover the pot partially. Cook for roughly 30 minutes and keep stirring every 10 minutes.\n5. Remove the lid and turn the heat to medium. Keep stirring the pork riblets occasionally so it does not burn. Roughly 10 minutes or until all the liquid has evaporated. The Asian pork riblets will be a nice dark colour with a nice glaze.\n6. Remove from pot and garnish with green onions and sesame seeds. Serve immediately. Enjoy!",

Slice pork belly into 1-inch thick (or slightly thicker) pieces. In a bowl, toss the pork with crushed garlic, shallots, salt and pepper. Set aside at room temperature for 10-20 minutes.\n2. In a small saucepan, add 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of water. Bring to a boil, the sugar will fully dissolve. Lower the heat to medium, continue to simmer. You will see a lot of bubbles on the surface. The mixture will then turn from clear to yellow, and get darker as you simmer it. When it has a honey color, reduce the heat slightly. Keep watching closely, until it has a dark caramel color, turn off the heat and carefully add 1 tablespoon of water. Swirl the saucepan (or stir) to combine and remove it from the stove. Set aside.\n3. Place a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat and add a small amount of cooking oil. Once the oil is hot, add the pork belly, along with all the crushed garlic and shallots, and the caramel sauce. Stir and cook to coat the pork with the caramel sauce and then add fish sauce. Continue to stir and cook.\n4. Once the outside of the pork is no longer pink, add coconut juice enough to cover the meat. Bring it to a boil and skim off all the foams, then lower to a simmer.Cover the pot with the lid slightly askew and simmer until the pork is almost tender to your liking (about 75-80 minutes). You can give everything a stir once in a while for even cooking if you want.\n5. While braising the pork belly, boil the eggs so that they are just about to reach hard-boiled. Place the eggs in cold water to cool down, and then peel them.\n6. Once the pork is almost tender, add the eggs (make sure they are surrounded with the braising liquid). Cover and simmer for about 10 more minutes.\n7. Transfer the caramelized pork belly and eggs along with the sauce to a shallow serving plate. Serve hot with white rice.",

        "recipe_comment":"Hi there - We spit-roasted a pork roast on July 24th. We made a feast and it was a bit of pain, but overall, I feel like this pork roast was one of the best mesh of flavors I've ever had:  \n**Spit-Roasted Pork**\n\n* Serving Size - 150g of Meat\n* 8 Servings\n* Prep Time - 4 hours\n* Cook Time - 1 hour\n* Wait Time - 20 minutes\n* Total Time - 5.5 hours  \n\n\n**Ingredients**  \n**Brine**\n\n* Boneless Pork Roast\n* 2 cups of Water\n* 2 tbsp of Sea Salt\n* 2 tbsp of honey  \n\n\n**Rub**\n\n* 2 tbsp, ground black pepper\n* 3 tbsp, ground Rue\n* 2 tbsp, ground coriander seed\n* 2 tbsp, Fenugreek seeds\n\n  \n**Glaze**\n\n* 1\/2 cup Red Wine Vinegar\n* 1\/2 cup of honey\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Rinse and pat dry the pork roast.\n2. Combine water, sea salt and honey in a stock pot until it is all dissolved. Once dissolved; submerge the pork roast under brine.\n3. Once submerged, cover and refrigerate for 3-7 hours.\n4. While the pork is in the brine, take the rub ingredients and grind them together. We use a mortar and pestle because it's more accurate, but feel free to use a spice grinder.\n5. Once completed, mix the glaze ingredients together.\n6. One hour before cooking, take the pork loin out of the fridge. Remove from brine and pat dry.\n7. Once the pork is dried, score the fat on the roast to a 1\" diamond shape.\n8. Take half of the rub and rub into the meat, including into the crevices of the scores.\n9. Take the remaining rub at add it to the glaze mixture. I put the glaze directly into the honey bottle, so I would shake it up periodically before I glazed.\n10. Place a drip pan where you expect the pork to be. Start the grill or fire, placing the coals on both sides of the pan. Get the grill or fire to 250f degrees; then place the pork into the spit.\n11. Place the pork over the spit, suspended about 6 to 8 inches above the coals.\n12. Cook the pork for 1 hour, rotating every 10-25 minutes. Anytime we rotated it, I brushed on the glaze. The pork roast should hit an internal temperature of 165f.\n13. Once completed, remove from heat and spit. Allow it to rest for 15 minutes before cutting.  \n\n\n**Notes**\n\n* We only brined for 3 hours, so we did the NOT recommended decision to leave the pork on the counter. As a reminder, food outside of refrigeration for long periods can lead to food-borne illnesses. We had decided since we were brining for less time than ideal, that getting it to room temperature earlier would be best.\n\nWe did a bunch of research about food that a mix-gendered group would be able to have at feast in Ancient Greece. We had a blast putting this together, but we're both ready to move on from there. I recommend using Rue - It's such an interesting herb, but it's a bit difficult to find in some circles. I had to get it from Etsy from an herbal shop.\n\nwww.dining-through-time.com\/2022\/07\/24\/historical-recipes-a-feast-that-dionysus-would-appreciate\/",

        "recipe_comment":"Certainly not the quickest recipe, and to be honest not as good as you can get buying from people that make them for a living, but as a British expat this is as close as I can get.\n\nRecipe lightly modified from here: [https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/food\/recipes\/scotcheggs\\_85851](https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/food\/recipes\/scotcheggs_85851)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nFor the sausage meat:\n\n\\- 1lb lean minced pork\n\n\\- 20g Stuffing Mix (Bland as possible so American style preferably. I used Stove Top pork)- Freshly ground Pepper\n\n\\- 2 tsp fresh thyme\n\n\\- 1 tsp parsley flakes\n\n\\- 1 tsp sage\n\n\\- 2 small shallots, very finely chopped\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the scotch eggs:\n\n\\- 6 medium eggs\n\n\\- 80g plain flower, seasoned with salt and pepper\n\n\\- 1 egg beaten\n\n\\- 3 slices of white bread, lightly toasted then ground into breadcrumbs\n\n\\- vegetable oil, for frying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Method**\n\n\\- Combine all the ingredients for the sausage meat together in a medium bowl, mix thoroughly. Meat can be covered and stored in fridge for later use.\n\n\\- Place the eggs, unbroken, in cold salted water. Bring to the boil then immediately reduce tempreature and simmer for 9 min. (You may have to do this in stages, if so you only need to let the water cool to warm between batches)\n\n\\- When the eggs are finished strain and cool under running water. Then peel off the shells, if you haven't done this before I recommend looking up a video, fingernails help.\n\n\\- Take the sausage meet and divide into sixths on a clean cutting board, before flattening each into a shallow oval \\~1\/4\" thick.\n\n\\- Spread the seasoned flower onto a large plate. One at a time take a peeled egg and dredge it in flower until a thin coating sticks to all surfaces, before placing the egg at the center of the flattened sausage meat, and wrapping the meat around it and gently rolling to form a smooth egg shaped ball.\n\n\\- Prepare the breadcrumbs, I used a stick blender and a tall cup to get them fine enough. Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate. One at a time coat the meat wrapped eggs in the beaten egg mixture before rolling in bread crumbs enough to ensure a even coating on all surfaces.\n\n\\- With all the eggs prepared select a high walled pot and fill with oil, quantity will vary based on pot selection but ideally should be enough to completely submerge the prepared egg. **Important:** Do not fill the pot anywhere near to full, remember when you place eggs in the oil level will rise and we do not want it to boil over. Heat the oil until a loose breadcrumb placed in it will bubble and brown in around 30s. (I found this was around 370F)\n\n\\- The eggs will be cooked for \\~9 min in the hot oil. I suggest using a slotted spoon to place and remove them. I encourage you to monitor the oil tempreature yourself, either by thermometer or look and feel and suggest you open up the first egg cooked and determine if any adjustments need to be made. It will all be relative to your setup but I cooked the eggs two at a time on alternating cycles, one egg removed every four and a half minutes, my oil temperature remained fairly constant at \\~320F, and I rotated the eggs twice to ensure even cooking.\n\n\\- **Important:** Usual safety precautions when working with hot oil apply, always use long implements to place eggs into the oil preferably from the side of the pot. Be aware of the temperament of the oil, sizzling is good bubbling is worrying. Be aware of the level of the oil as you add and remove the eggs. Finally as I was working in a small pot I took the step of turning off the gas every time I added a egg to prevent risk of flare up if the oil overflowed.\n\n\\- When the eggs are finished place them on a sheet of kitchen roll to absorb excess oil. Personal preference is to serve chilled or at room temperature, though they can be eaten warm after allowing some time to cool.  \n\n\n  \n**Improvements**  \nThis is probably the simplest least creative recipe for scotch eggs out there, I was deliberately aiming for generic. It does however make it completely open to adaptation\/improvement. If I were to make it again I would definitely attempt to address the slightly bland breadcrumbs, I suspect the answer may be more salt but I also want to see if some herbs (perhaps sage) add some complexity to the flavor.",

        "recipe_comment":"as someone who has been playing around with this type of dish a while now (and love it, please everyone give this a try its so comforting), i will warn that depending on the recipe you use, some may find it too salty, while others will be fine - when im in taiwan some places serve a version that is very potent and delicious, and served a different sauce to rice ratio because the flavors stretch out that long. So you'll find a range of flavor strengths that cater to how much else you may be eating with it!\n\nOther versions (i believe northern taiwan is more towards this) use just minced pork and may add in pork fat\/skin portions to their own tastes, and these versions also taste absolutely delicious - dont feel worried if you cant find pork belly.\n\nPersonally, i love it served with any pickle! traditional pickled mustard greens, soy pickled cucumbers, kimchi, viet sweet pickled radishes and carrots, pickled red onions - i dont actually love pickles, but with a dish as luxurious and rich as this, i think it elevates to a new level.\n\nTea eggs are also a classic, but i sometimes just love an over-easy egg cracked on top of it.\n\nThank you OP for reminding me of this gem of a dish, im going to make it again next week. This week i made a somewhat similar chicken dish version of this called \" Ji Rou Fan.\"\n\nEdit: Oh my gosh how could i forget, this sauce is SO versatile. It doesnt just transform rice into something else, it goes so nicely on top of clear broth noodles or noodle soups in general. It really is a dish so very close to the hearts of many of the Taiwanese. My closest comparison i could think of to this would be a wonderfully deep and rich beef ragu or bolognese sauce.",

When the pork is done marinating, pour the leftover marinade into a saucepan.\n\n5. Cook the pork in a preheated 250F oven for about 12 hours or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 200F.  Cooking time will vary depending on the pork's weight and your oven.  You can also use a grill or smoker instead of the oven.  Cover the pork with foil after about an hour to prevent burning.\n \n6. While the pork cooks, bring the marinade to a boil over medium heat.  Reduce the marinade into a sauce until you achieve your desired thickness.  Keep in mind the marinade will thicken after it cools.  Remove the garlic, ginger, and green onion when done and let cool before storing in the fridge.\n \n7. After the pork is done, remove the shoulder bone and pull the meat apart using two forks.\n \n8.

        "recipe_comment":"Cochinita Tacos are one of the most popular foods in the Mexican region of Yucatan. Pork meat is prepared by marinating in a unique spice blend called Red Recado and slow-cooked in fruit juices over a period of 21 hours. The meat is then mixed with the cooking juices, served on a corn tortilla with red onion pickle. Taco is garnished with cilantro or parsley. Sometimes salsa or guacamole is also served as a topping but it is a personal preference.\n\nAt home, I used a slow-cooker on a low setting. 8 pm start for the overnight cook, meat was ready lunchtime on the following day. The only side effect of this method of cooking is sleepless night as the delicious aromas keep you awake...\n\n## What kind of meat is used for Cochinita Pibil Tacos?\n\nTraditionally, hairless Mexican pig is used for Cochinitas. For the top-quality meat, pigs are raised in an organic setting, fed with a variety of fruit, grass, grains and vegetables. Papaya is their most beloved feed on the menu giving the pork a unique flavour. Almost all parts of the animal are used for recipe ranging from ears, cheeks, main body to offal.\n\nTo prepare Cochinitas at home I choose Pork shoulder as my preference. Next time I will definitely try ribs or belly.\n\nRemember to choose the best quality meat from sources that respect animal life and consumers health!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n## What is a Red Recado Spice blend?\n\nThe main ingredient of Red Recado is an Annatto that comes from the Achiote tree native to the tropical region of Mexico and Brazil.

Add the meat, and stir for around 5 minutes. Add lime to taste\n10. Steam the bao buns (I use steam baskets that I bought during my exchange in Hong Kong) until they\u2019re soft and you\u2019re able to open them easily - they will be hot so watch out\n11. Put the meat on the buns, add some sauce and your garnish :)\n\nI hope I translated everything correctly!",

I made a few adjustments to the recipe to increase the spiciness, I hope you enjoy it!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThis makes around 6 portions\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1kg (2.2Pounds) pork ribs sliced (remember to buy good quality meat from the good source - It tastes soo much better, especially when it comes to pork)\n* 2 peppers diced (yellow and red)\n* 1 medium carrot halved and sliced\n* 1 celery stalk fine dice\n* 2 medium onions diced\n* 5 garlic cloves sliced\n* 1tsp caraway\n* 2 bay leaves\n* 3 allspice berries\n* 1tsp black pepper\n* 5tsp paprika (It works with smoked paprika as well)\n* 1-1,5L (1-1,6quarts) of vegetable stock\n* 3tbsp of canola oil for frying spices and veg\n* gravy to thicken (amount will vary depending on the powder you use)\n* parsley to garnish\n* pickled jalapeno to garnish\n* mashed potato to serve\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n**1.** Heat the frying pan to very high and sear the ribs on each side until golden brown. Once ready, transfer to a spare pot leaving the rendered fat behind.\n\n**2.** Next, lower the heat slightly and fry the mirepoix to colour then transfer to spare pot.\n\n**3.** Add **1tbsp** of canola oil and stir-fry peppers until coloured then transfer to spare pot.\n\n**4.** Lower the heat to medium and add **2tbsp** of canola oil and **5tsp** of paprika, mix it together and cook until aroma heats your nose, don't burn it.\n\n**5.** Transfer all the ingredients back to the braising pan and pour in enough stock to cover everything to **3\/4**.\n\n**6.** Add caraway, bay leaves, allspice and black pepper. Bring the temperature to just under the boiling point, cover with a lid and cook for **2-3 hours** or until the meat starts to fall off the bone (during that time you may need to add more stock to keep cooking liquid at **3\/4 level**).\n\n**7.** When ready mix couple of tablespoons of gravy powder with a little bit of water (enough to make it runny) and gently stir it into the ribs (add enough to thicken the sauce)\n\n**8.** Remove from the heat and allow to rest for **30 minutes** before serving.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Insight:**\n\n* Try it with pasta it works very well on the second day!\n* For slow braising reduce the temperature to **80C (176F)** and extend cooking time to 6-8 hours.\n\nBlog Post: [https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/polish-braised-spare-ribs-mash](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/polish-braised-spare-ribs-mash)",

        "recipe_comment":"Steamed spare ribs - a dim sum dish that's really easy to make at home!\n\nHere's the [video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rdCVFlSWCMI&amp;&amp;list=PLvd5bo3J-_kq4FcYVCOK6ZR87dCGDqrSH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s) for a walkthrough.\n\n## Dim Sum: A Touch of Heart\n\nThe way most of us pronounce \"dim sum\" in English is very similar to its Cantonese pronunciation, \"d\u00edm s\u0101m\", which roughly translates to \"a touch of heart\".\n\nIt's a reference to the delectable snacks that 10th century teahouses would serve to traveling merchants in Guangzhou, one of the largest international ports along the Silk Road.\n\nEven though dim sum is widely considered to belong to Cantonese cuisine, it evolved from a wide range of influences, largely because Guangzhou was and still is a critical hub for Chinese trade and a melting pot of different cultures.\u00a0\n\n## Rinsing ribs in water \n\nWhen dim sum restaurants serve spare ribs, their traditionally preferred look is much less light in color (vs the smoky, charred, dark look of a BBQ rib).\n\nThis is mostly an aesthetic choice, made to entice customers to order lots and lots of spare ribs from the carts of delicious foods.\n\nThe way to achieve this look is to rinse them in water for an extended period of time.\n\n## Why meat is red\n\nA common misconception is that the red juice that leaks out from meat is blood, but it\u2019s not. Most of the time, the blood has already been drained by the time you buy it, and the red juice is actually a result of freezing the meat during transport.\u00a0\n\nWhen you freeze meat, which is about 75% water, the water inside the muscles expands into ice crystals which rupture the muscle cells, and when the ice thaws, it carries some myoglobin with it.\n\nMyoglobin is an iron-rich protein that turns bright red when it\u2019s exposed to oxygen. The purpose of myoglobin is to store extra oxygen in muscles that are used for extended periods of time.\n\nInterestingly enough, this is why not all meats are red or dark. Beef and pork meat are red because cows and pigs stand and roam almost all day. In contrast, fish meat is mostly white, with some red meat around the fins and tail, because fish float in water and aren\u2019t constantly using the bulk of their muscles.\u00a0\n\n# The Recipe\n\n* Prep Time: 25 min\n* Total Time: 45 min\n* Yield: 4 servings\n\n# Ingredients\n\nMain Ingredients\n\n* 1 lb **spare ribs**\n   * Some grocery stores have pre-cut ribs, cut across the bone.\n   * If they don't sell pre-cut ribs, you can get St. Louis style ribs, and ask the butcher to cut across the bones for you. That will make your life much, much easier.\n   * My dad says it's better to select ribs towards the tail-end of the pig, as these tend to be less fatty.\n* 1 tbsp **dried fermented black bean**\n* 1 tsp **dried mandarin orange peel** (optional)\n   * Also known as \"chenpi\", this is a fragrant ingredient in Chinese cooking and medicine, believed to regulate our chi.\n   * My dad uses these for a lot of dishes outside of steamed spare ribs - soups, steamed fish, medicines, and etc. He has a huge stockpile that he's been building and aging for over 15 years.\n   * According to my dad, the district of Xinhui in China makes the best damn peels the world has ever seen. This is Xinhui's biggest export and a large economic driver for the famous district.\n   * If you like eating mandarin oranges, you can just save the peels and leave them outside to dry in the sun for 2-3 days. They should snap in half pretty easily when dry. Store them in a bag in cool, dry place.\n* 1 clove **garlic**\n* 1 tsp **ginger**\n* **red chili pepper** (a few slices, optional)\n* 2 pieces **green onion**\n\nFlavors + Misc\n\n* 0.50 tsp **salt**\n* 1 tsp **sugar**\n* 0.50 tbsp **light soy sauce**\n* 1 tsp **sesame oil**\n* 1 tbsp **oyster sauce**\n* 0.50 tbsp **Shaoxing wine**\n* 1 tbsp **cornstarch** (for rinsing ribs)\n* 2 tbsp **cornstarch** (for marinade)\n* 0.50 tsp **vegetable oil**\n\n# ----\n\n# Step 1 - Wash and rehydrate black beans, orange peel\n\nPlace our **fermented black beans** (1 tbsp) in a bowl, and rinse them under running water for 15-20 seconds. Gently massage the beans as you do this. Drain the water, and set the bowl aside to let the beans rehydrate.\n\nBreak off a bit of the **dried mandarin peel** (1 tsp) and soak it in warm water for 5-10 minutes.\n\n# Step 2 - Cut spare ribs\n\nCut the **spare ribs** (1 lb) between the bones into small pieces (about 1 to 1.5 inches), and place them into a bowl.\n\n# Step 3 - Rinse and dry ribs\n\nThis step is done in 3 parts.\n\n* Cornstarch:\n   * Add **cornstarch** (1 tbsp) to the ribs, and massage the ribs around to evenly mix the cornstarch around the surface of each rib.\n   * The cornstarch helps bind to the myoglobin and juices that we're looking to cleanse out.\n* Rinse:\n   * Rinse the ribs in running water for 1 to 2 minutes, massaging the ribs as you go.\n* Dry:\n   * Pour out all of the water, and press and squeeze the ribs against a colander to get rid of excess water\n   * Take a thick paper towel and wrap the ribs in it, pressing and patting to absorb moisture.\n\n# Step 4 - Marinate ribs\n\nBefore we start marinating, if you want to save time for later, start boiling 3-4 cups of water. This will be added to our wok when we start steaming.\n\nLet's prepare our marinade:\n\n* Add **salt** (0.50 tsp), **sugar** (1 tsp), **light soy sauce** (0.50 tbsp), **oyster sauce** (1 tbsp), **Shaoxing wine** (0.50 tbsp) to a separate bowl.\n* Mince **garlic** (1 clove), **ginger** (1 tsp), **rehydrated mandarin orange peel** (1 tsp), and add them to the separate bowl.\n   * While we're at it, cut a few slices of **red chili pepper** () and our **green onion** (2 pieces). These will be used as garnish for later.\n* Combine the bowl of flavors into the bowl of ribs. Mix and massage the bowl of ribs for 45-60 seconds to distribute all of the flavors.\n* Mince the **black beans** (1 tbsp), add to the bowl of ribs, and mix \/ massage the ribs for 20-30 seconds\n* Add **sesame oil** (1 tsp) and **cornstarch** (2 tbsp), and mix \/ massage the ribs around for another 60 seconds to evenly coat each rib with cornstarch.\n\nMassaging the ribs, i.e. applying a little bit of pressure, helps the meat absorb the flavors and tenderizes the meat a bit.\n\n# Step 5 - Prepare to steam ribs\n\nHeat our wok on our stove, placing our steamer rack in the center of the wok. Add enough boiled water so that it just barely covers the entire steamer rack.\n\nTransfer the ribs into the plate you'll be steaming with, being careful not to let any ribs be covered by one another. Add the chili pepper slices, and pour vegetable oil on the ribs.\n\n# Step 6 - Cover wok &amp; steam\n\nCarefully place the plate of ribs on top of the steamer rack. Double check to make sure that there's a little bit of water touching the bottom surface of the plate.\n\nCover the wok, set the stove to its highest heat setting, and steam the spare ribs for 20 minutes.\n\n# Step 7 - Garnish &amp; enjoy!\n\nAfter 20 minutes, turn the heat off, uncover the wok, garnish with the green onions, and carefully remove the plate from the wok. Enjoy!\n\n# ----\n\n# Celebrating my parents' legacy \n\nI've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.\n\nThanks for reading! We hope you enjoyed this recipe as much as we enjoyed sharing it :)",

        "recipe_comment":"## Sausage Leek Risotto with Sage\n\nThis sausage leek risotto with sage is rich, creamy, spicy, and loaded with chopped Swiss chard. It's a perfectly comforting sausage risotto recipe!\n\nPrep Time: 10 minutes\n\nCook Time: 45 minutes\n\nServings: 6 \n\nCalories: 520kcal \n\nAuthor: Kylie Perrotti\n\n### Equipment\n\n* Wide pot\n\n### Ingredients\n\n* 1 teaspoon neutral cooking oil for frying\n* 1 pound loose hot Italian sausage\n* 1\/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper optional\n* 4 tablespoons butter divided\n* 2 small leeks thoroughly washed, trimmed, and cut thinly into rounds\n* 1\u00bd cups arborio rice\n* 4-5 cups hot chicken broth low-sodium\n* 1 bunch Swiss chard stems removed, leaves chopped\n* 2 ounces sage leaves chiffonaded\n* \u2153 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n### Instructions\n\n#### Brown the Sausage:\n\n* Heat the cooking oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks, for 10-12 minutes until well-browned and cooked-through. Season with extra crushed red pepper, if desired. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.\n* Drain off excess fat from the pot, reserving any fond stuck to the bottom of the pot.\n\n#### Cook the Leeks:\n\n* Melt 2 tablespoons butter in the pot. Once frothy, add the leeks and cook for 8-10 minutes until very soft. Season lightly with salt and pepper.\n\n#### Start the Rice:\n\n* Melt the remaining butter in the pot and add the rice. Cook over medium heat, stirring regularly, for 2-3 minutes until just beginning to turn translucent.\n\n#### Cook the Risotto:\n\n* Add 1 ladle of the hot broth (it should be enough to mostly cover the rice in the pot) and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat to low and stir often for 2-3 minutes until most of the liquid is absorbed. Continue adding a ladle of liquid and stirring for a few minutes until absorbed until 4 cups of the liquid has been added. If you need more liquid, add another cup and allow the liquid to absorb.\n\n#### Cook the Greens:\n\n* Once most of the liquid has been absorbed, add the chopped Swiss chard, sage, and reserved cooked sausage. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring regularly, until the Swiss chard is wilted. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n#### Finish the Risotto:\n\n* Turn the heat off the risotto and allow it to rest for 5 minutes. Grate the parmesan cheese into the pot and stir to incorporate.\n\n#### To Serve:\n\n* Divide the risotto between bowls and add a little more parmesan on top, if desired.

        "recipe_comment":"This is one of the tastiest Chinese dishes of all time! \n\n### INGREDIENTS\n\n* 1.5 pounds thick pork belly (about 1.5 inches wide; skin on)\n* 3 cups water\n* 2 cloves garlic (crushed)\n* 1\/2 inch ginger (sliced thin)\n* 2 star anise\n* 10 Szechuan peppercorn (optional if can\u2019t find at grocery store)\n* 1\/2 cinnamon stick\n* 2 tablespoons cooking oil\n* 7 tablespoons brown sugar\n* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce\n* 4 tablespoons dark soy sauce\n* 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)\n\n### DIRECTIONS\n\n* In a wide pot or pan, add the three cups of water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat (the water level should be at least half the thickness of the pork belly). Add the pork belly and parboil for a minute on each side, just until the exterior is a bit firm. Remove the pork belly to a cutting board, and set the hot water aside (don\u2019t pour it out!)\n* Add the garlic, ginger, star anise, Szechuan peppercorn, and cinnamon stick to the water and keep over low heat (we need this water to be hot since we will be adding it back to the pork and if it gets cold then it might cause the meat to toughen up)\n* Cut the pork belly into cubes about 1.5 inches on each side\n* In a Dutch oven or large pot, start heating up the oil over medium-low heat. Add 3.5 tablespoons of the brown sugar. Let the sugar sit undisturbed until you see it start to melt. Once it starts melting, you can use a single chopstick to mix it up a bit to speed up the melting process\n* When all the sugar has melted and turned into a dark amber color, add the pork belly. Cook while flipping the pieces for a few minutes until almost every side of each piece is covered with the caramel. Be gentle so you don\u2019t break the pieces!\n* Add the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine and cook for a minute. Then add the water with all the spices and aromatics. Braise the pork belly over medium-low heat for 2 hours, stirring once every 30 minutes\n* After 2 hours, the pork should be fully tender. You can check by sticking a chopstick into the meat through the bottom. The chopstick should be able to easily pierce the entire piece. If you want it to be more tender, put the lid back on and keep braising until it reaches your desired tenderness\n* Remove the lid and raise the heat to medium. Add the remaining 3.5 tablespoons of sugar and mix. Cook for about 20 minutes, until the sauce has reduced significantly and thickened up. Stir every few minutes to prevent the meat from burning. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s done when the sauce is thick enough to start sticking to the meat\n* Remove the meat from the pot and then drizzle with some of the extra sauce. Serve hot with a side of rice and vegetables\n\n[Full recipe](https:\/\/www.theminichef.com\/chinese-braised-pork-belly-hong-shao-rou\/)",

I don't know how it's called there)\n\nsome string to tie up\n\n50g sweet paprika\n\n50g red pepper flakes\n\na scale is recommended\n\n**Steps**\n\n1-First you get your meat. if it's kinda roundish you can leave it there. if it has any really weird shapes or is too big you can cut it in half as I did with mine  just make sure the parts are kinda round\n\n2-pour about 2cm of coarse salt in the container. then lay your meat there and completely cover it with coarse salt\n\n3-Leave it in fridge without opening the container for a week. that should mostly dry it and give it some salt taste\n\n4-once a week has passed  you want to get it out of the container. then discard the salt.\n\n5-Completely rinse all salt out of it. none of it can stay. check all little holes and make sure no salt is left\n\n6-dry it with some paper towels make sure it's not wet\n\n7-mix your red pepper flakes and sweet paprika. but not all of it, this is where you select how spicy you want it. I did 60% sweet paprika, 40% red pepper flakes.  you can put a bit less pepper flakes but I wouldn't put more of it in there\n\n8-now with that mix, completely rub the meat with it. make sure it's all covered. you don't need to use all the mix you made. but just make sure you cover all of it\n\n9-once it's covered try to give it a more round shape with your hands. it doesn't need to be perfect\n\n10- now tightly surround it with your cooking paper make sure it isn't loose. once you do that, tie the ends in opossite directions. like one of those candy papers\n\n11-now tie the ends, with your string. then use the string to tie sections of the meat to make it as round as you can\n\n12-Weigh it in your scale and write down the weight.\n\n13-put in fridge. and wait. weigh it periodically once the bondiola weighs 30% less than that weight you measured earlier it's ready to eat, for example if it weighs 2kg. you have to wait till it weighs 1.4kg.\n\nAnd you Are Done! try to slice it as thin as you can and eat it with some nice bread. this is extremely tasty and really easy and cheap to make. it tastes brilliant and you will be absolutely in love with it. Enjoy! greetings from argentina",

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally:** [**Thai Pork Cucumber Soup**](https:\/\/triedtrue.us\/PorkCucumberSoup)\n\nSomeone told me about Chrissy Teigan\u2019s Thai pork stuffed cucumber soup and I knew I wanted to try making my own version of it. \n\nThe woman who posted it to our group shared Chrissy Teigan's recipe and she said she felt like the version she ate growing up had more cilantro or spices in it. I did a little hunting and found a version on Cookpad by Kanya from Thailand which uses LOTS of cilantro. Kanya's version uses tofu, which I didn\u2019t have, so I omitted that.\n\nObviously, both versions are probably equally tasty, but I was definitely intrigued by the white pepper in the pork from Kanya's recipe, so that's what I used as my starting point.\n\nThis is a really easy recipe and a unique take on a really cheap veggie that most of us are probably swimming in this time of year!\n\n# SUBSTITUTIONS:\n\nGround Pork: Ground chicken or ground turkey\n\nCucumber: Seedless or seeded, doesn't matter\n\nGround White Pepper: Use black pepper instead \u2013 it won't have exactly the same flavor, but it's ok.\n\nYou can follow Kanya's method and add tofu to it, as well!\n\n# RECIPE\n\n## Equipment\n\n* Large pot\n\n## Ingredients\n\n## Pork Mixture\n\n* 1 pound ground pork\n* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* 3 tablespoons soy sauce\n* \u00bd tablespoon sesame oil\n* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste\n* 1 teaspoon ground white pepper\n* \u00bc cup fresh cilantro leaves and stems minced (see note)\n\n## Cucumber Soup:\n\n* 2 large cucumbers\n* 6 cups water or low-sodium chicken stock\n* 3 tablespoons soy sauce\n* \u00bd tablespoon sesame oil\n* 1 bunch cilantro stems minced (see note)\n* 1 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste\n* 1 scallion minced; white and green parts separated\n* Salt, to taste\n* Sesame seeds optional, for garnish\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Prepare the Broth:\n\n* Combine the water, soy sauce, sesame oil, minced cilantro stems, black pepper, sriracha, and white part of the scallion in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer as you prepare the rest of the ingredients.\n\n## Prepare the Cucumbers:\n\n* Peel the cucumbers and cut into three or four pieces depending on the length. Using the back of a spoon, hallow out the seeds and discard them. Set aside.\n\n## Prepare the Pork Mixture:\n\n* In a bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the pork and mix until well-combined.\n\n## Stuff the Cucumbers:\n\n* Carefully stuff the cucumbers with the pork. Roll any remaining pork into small meatballs.\n\n## Boil the Cucumbers:\n\n* Turn the heat on the broth to a vigorous simmer. Carefully drop the cucumbers and meatballs into the soup and cook for about 15-20 minutes until the pork is completely cooked through and the cucumbers have softened. Turn off the heat.\n\n## To Serve:\n\n* Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with extra cilantro leaves, minced green part of the scallion, and sesame seeds. Enjoy!\n\n## Notes\n\n*In this recipe, you can use 1* [*small*](https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/video\/f\/fd\/Chop%20Cilantro%20Step%207%20Version%202.360p.mp4) *bunch of cilantro. Cut the cilantro right beneath where the bunch becomes leafy and mince the stems. Use about 1\/4 cup of the leaves for the meatballs and use any remaining cilantro as garnish. If you have a very large bunch,\u00a0 just use discretion on how much cilantro you want to use!*\n\n## Nutrition\n\nCalories: 356kcal | Carbohydrates: 4g | Protein: 22g | Fat: 28g | Saturated Fat: 9g | Cholesterol: 82mg | Sodium: 1573mg | Potassium: 401mg | Fiber: 1g | Sugar: 1g | Vitamin A: 30IU | Vitamin C: 3mg | Calcium: 29mg | Iron: 2mg",

Blend until smooth. This unique blend will serve as the creamy base for your curry.\n\n**2.** In a large saucepan or wok, heat a bit of oil over medium heat. Add the red curry paste and fry for a minute or two until it becomes aromatic. This step is crucial for releasing the flavors of the curry.\n\n**3.** Pour the blended fish-coconut mixture into the saucepan with the curry paste. Mix well to ensure the curry paste is evenly distributed.\n\n**4.** Add the second can of coconut cream to the saucepan and stir well. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce will begin to thicken and the flavors will meld together.\n\n**5.** Add the diced potatoes and sliced carrots to the simmering sauce. Cover and let it simmer for approximately 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.\n\n**6.** Once the vegetables are cooked, add the king prawns to the curry. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and fully cooked. Be cautious not to overcook them.\n\n**7.** Fold in a handful of fresh spinach right before you're ready to serve. The residual heat will wilt the spinach without overcooking it.\n\n**8.** Taste and adjust the seasoning of your curry. You might want to add salt, a splash of lime juice for a tangy kick, and a little fish sauce for extra umami. If to thick adjust with a little bit of water.\n\n**9.** Garnish with fresh coriander if desired, and serve your Thai-style fish and prawn curry while it's warm. It pairs beautifully with rice vermicelli noodles for a complete meal, offering a delightful texture contrast to the creamy curry. Enjoy !",

(optional marinating step) If you are cooking for a picky eater that can\u2019t stand strong fishy taste like my daughter, this step is very important. Julienne 1 piece of fresh ginger, and 1 spring onion, the white part only. Pour 0.5 cup of water in the container and a tsp of Chinese cooking wine. Add 0.5 tsp of ground white pepper. Rub the ginger and spring onion with your fingers and mix well, let it sit.\n2. Cut your fish fillets into approximately 3x5cm bitable sizes.\n3. Place your fish fillets skin down. With your knife at a slight 45 degree angle, carefully cut the meat, just deep enough to reach the skin beneath without actually cutting through the skin. Next, cut the fish fillets crosswise (again, at a 45 degree angle).\n4. Place your fillets in the marinate bow, gently rub them and make sure all of them are coated evenly in the marinating juice. Leave it aside for 5 mins, take them out and dry them. (if you do not wish to marinate them, move to step 5.\n5. Chop your red bell pepper into 1x1cm cubes. My daughter loves sweetcorns, so I added 3 table spoons of reduce-salt canned sweetcorn.\n6. Julienne 1 piece of fresh ginger and 1 spring onion (only the green bit).\n7. Put all the sweet and sour sauce ingredients in a bowl, mix well, set aside.\n8. Beat the egg well.\n9. Coat your fish fillets with egg, and drain excessive egg.\n10. Coat your fish fillets with cornflour, and make sure you also coat the cracks of your cross-patterned cuts.\n11. Pour around 500g vegetable oil into a pot, bringing it to around 160 \u00b0C \/ 320 \u00b0F.\n12. Carefully place your fish fillets in and fry until light brown.\n13. Take them out, let cool, and fry a second time until golden brown, place them aside.\n14. Warm up a frying pan, add a tablespoon of oil, let it heat up.\n15. Add julienned ginger, spring onion, sweetcorn and belt pepper in, stir fry for 1 min.\n16. Mix your bowl of sweet and sour sauce again, pour it carefully in your frying pan, keep stirring until it thickens.\n17. Turn off your hob, put your fried fish fillets in, toss them around, make sure they are evenly coated by the sauce.\n18. Plate and enjoy with some rice!\n\n[Link to blog post with pictures and printable recipe](https:\/\/linschinesekitchen.com\/sweet-sour-fish-recipe\/)",

The shells aren't essential but are nice for presentation.\n* Glass noodles: As many or as little as you like, it's really flexible. That mound you see in the picture was maybe 200g, which is a pretty conservative amount for two people.\n* Plenty of minced garlic and butter, much more than you think you need.\n* A tiny amount of soy sauce, maybe about a teaspoon per portion.

        "recipe_comment":"**Recipe here originally:** [**Spicy Shrimp Risotto**](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/spicy-shrimp-risotto\/)\n\nThis spicy shrimp risotto is a creamy, spicy dinner recipe that you're going to love. We don't skimp on shrimp in this easy risotto recipe!\n\nPrep Time: 15 minutes\n\nCook Time: 40 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 55 minutes\n\nServings: 5\n\nCalories: 667kcal\n\nAuthor: Kylie Perrotti\n\nEquipment\n\n* Wide pot\n* Large saucepan\n\nIngredientsSpicy Shrimp:\n\n* 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil\n* 1 shallot peeled and thinly sliced\n* 5 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* 4 Roma tomatoes cored and roughly chopped\n* 1 pint cherry tomatoes\n* 2 tablespoons butter optional\n* \u00be cup dry white wine\n* 2-3 cups chicken or vegetable stock plus more, as needed\n* 1\/2 teaspoon dry thyme\n* 1\/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper more or less to taste\n* 2 pounds large shrimp peeled and deveined (half chopped, half left whole)\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nRisotto:\n\n* 4 tablespoons butter\n* 2 cups carnaroli rice or arborio rice (cooking instructions may vary)\n* 6 cups chicken or vegetable stock\n* Salt to taste\n\nFor Serving (Optional):\n\n* Dry or fresh minced parsley\n* A drizzle of extra virgin olive oil\n\nInstructionsStart the Spicy Shrimp:\n\n* Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 3-4 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.\n\nCook the Tomatoes:\n\n* Add the chopped tomatoes and the cherry tomatoes and cook for 3-4 minutes more. Melt the butter into the pot. Once frothy, add the white wine and bring to a boil for 5 minutes to allow the wine to reduce slightly.\n\nSimmer the Broth:\n\n* Add the stock, starting with 2 cups. Season everything in the pot with salt, pepper, thyme, and crushed red pepper. Reduce heat and simmer for 25 minutes. Adding more stock, as necessary, if too much cooks off. There should be enough broth to coat about 1\/4'' of the bottom of the pan, but it should not be soupy.\n\nCook the Risotto:\n\n* First, warm the chicken stock (either in a small saucepan on the stove or in a large glass measuring cup in the microwave).\n* Melt the butter into the large sauce pan over medium heat. Once melted, add the rice and cook, stirring regularly, until it begins to toast and turn golden brown, about 4-5 minutes.\n* Ladle 1-2 cups of the broth into the rice and stir regularly. Once the liquid is mostly absorbed (do not let the rice stick), add another 1-2 cups. Continue adding ladles of stock until all of the stock is mostly absorbed and the rice is tender but not mushy, about 16-20 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to rest for 5 minutes. Season with salt.\n\nCook the Shrimp:\n\n* As the risotto finishes cooking, add the shrimp to the broth and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-7 minutes until opaque and cooked through. Do not overcook. Turn off the heat and keep warm. Taste and season again to your preferences.\n\nTo Serve:\n\n* Add a few ladles of the spicy shrimp to the pot of risotto and stir gently to incorporate. Divide the risotto between plates and pile more spicy shrimp on top. Garnish with parsley and extra virgin olive oil, if desired. Enjoy!\n\nNutrition\n\nCalories: 667kcal | Carbohydrates: 72g | Protein: 44g | Fat: 18g | Saturated Fat: 9g | Cholesterol: 493mg | Sodium: 1550mg | Potassium: 584mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin A: 1355IU | Vitamin C: 37mg | Calcium: 292mg | Iron: 8mg",

Pre-heat oven to 450F  \n2. Lightly oil red peppers and cook in the oven for 15 mins  \n3. Turn peppers 90 degrees so remainder can cook for another 15 mins until blackened\/blistered  \n4. Remove from oven, tent with foil and set aside (note: you can also put them into a Tupperware with a closed lid so they will steam and make for easier peeling)\n\n  \n**Cook and Peel Shrimp:**  \n1. You can cook the shrimp one of two ways, depending on your equipment:  \n\\- Steam - in a medium saucepan, bring 1\/2 cup water to boil, add shrimp and cover for \\~3 mins until shrimp turn pink.  \n\\- Saut\u00e9 - in a medium frying pan\/wok\/skillet, heat pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tbsp oil, saut\u00e9 shrimp for 2-3 mins per side flipping once.  \n2. Set aside to cool\n\n  \n**Prep your veg**  \n1. Fine dice onion, celery and carrot and set aside (can be combined in one bowl)  \n2. Mince garlic and shallot and set aside (can be combined in another bowl, separate from onion, celery, carrot)\n\n  \n**Make Shrimp Stock**  \n1. Peel shrimp, separating shells and shrimp into two bowls  \n2. Sprinkle shrimp with old bay, then put into the fridge to stay cool  \n3. Melt 1 tbsp butter in saucepan over medium heat  \n4. Add shells to saucepan, saut\u00e9 on medium for \\~5 mins til red and vibrant  \n5. Add 3 cups chicken stock, 2 bay leaves, 3 smashed cloves garlic  \n6. Bring to boil and simmer for 25 minutes  \n7. Strain into clean bowl and set aside\n\n  \n**Start building the Bisque**  \n1. Add 2 tbsp olive oil to soup pot (at least 6-8 quart capacity) over medium heat  \n2. Saut\u00e9 onion, celery, carrot, and pinch of salt til soft and fragrant about 5 mins (Note: just trying to \u201csweat\u201d these veg, not caramelize)  \n3. Add garlic and shallots, saut\u00e9 until fragrant (\\~2-3 mins)  \n4. Add sherry wine, and cook 3-4 mins until alcohol is cooked off  \n5. Add Strained shrimp stock, can of coconut milk, 1\/2 tbsp paprika, pinch red pepper flakes  \n6. Mix to combine, and then set aside to cool\n\n  \n**Peel Red Pepper**  \n1. While Bisque base is cooling, peel the skins off of the red pepper, remove stem and core so you just have the flesh\n\n  \n**Blend together**  \n*Note: blending hot liquids can be super dangerous as the steam released from the food can blow the top off the blender if not sufficiently cooled or safely done. There's a great video by America\u2019s Test Kitchen on the subject and how to do it safely.*  \n1. Blend cooled (warm\/lukewarm is fine) soup in batches with the bell pepper to get smooth  \n2. Return to soup pot over medium heat to bring it back up to temperature and ensure it is well-combined\n\n  \n**Serve**  \n1. Cut shrimp into 1\/2 or 1\/3 pieces so they can fit onto a soup spoon  \n2. Pour soup into bowls and top with shrimp and Old Bay to taste  \n3. Pair with bread (toasted sourdough slides are my favorite)",

Before beginning, prepare the leek as it takes the most time. Halve the leek lengthwise and very thinly slice both halves into 1\/8-inch wide slivers. You may need to separate some of the layers of the leek and slice each layer separately. If you find bits of dirt deep within the leek, don\u2019t fret. You can place all the leek slivers in a sieve and rinse again once more to remove any stubborn flecks of dirt.\n2. Transfer the sliced leek to a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry to remove any excess water.\n\n**Steep the saffron:**\n\n1. Place the crushed saffron in a small bowl and cover it with 2 tablespoons of hot water. Set aside.\n\n**Prepare the guanciale chili oil:**\n\n1. Place the guanciale in a large pot (you\u2019ll use this pot later for the orzo and cod!) and turn the heat to medium. Cook, turning occasionally, for 8\u201310 minutes until the fat renders and the guanciale becomes crispy.\n2. Add the shallot, garlic, and crushed red pepper and cook for an additional 3 minutes, turning often and adjusting the heat as needed to prevent the garlic from browning. Once the shallot softens, and the garlic takes on a very light golden color, spoon the mixture into a bowl. Scoop out all but a tablespoon of the fat from the pot and add it to the bowl of guanciale.\n3. Pour the extra virgin olive oil, chili oil, and maple syrup over the guanciale. Stir vigorously to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add more maple syrup, chili oil, or crushed red pepper, depending on your preferences.\n4. The guanciale oil will keep in an airtight jar for up to 5 days.\n\n**Prepare the saffron cod and orzo:**\n\n1. Pat the cod dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Return the pot of remaining guanciale fat to medium heat. Add the sliced fennel bulb and stalks along with the sliced shallot. Season with salt and cook for 5\u20136 minutes until the fennel begins to soften.\n3. Add the garlic and cook for 1\u20132 minutes until just fragrant.\n4. Melt the butter into the pot and add the orzo. Stir to coat and cook for 1\u20132 minutes until it begins to lightly toast. Season with salt.\n5. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil for 2\u20133 minutes. Stir often to lift up any orzo that may have stuck to the bottom.\n6. Reduce heat to low and arrange the cod on top. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Drizzle the steeped saffron mixture all over, ensuring that each piece of cod gets a little bit of saffron water.\n7. Cover and simmer over low heat for 12\u201315 minutes or until the cod is opaque and the orzo is tender.\n\n**Frizzle the leek:**\n\n1. *Note: Use a saucepan that has somewhat high sides. Generally, you want a saucepan that\u2019s at least 6\u20138 inches deep. When you add the leeks to the hot oil, the oil will foam up vigorously, and you do NOT want it pouring over the edges.*\n2. As the cod simmers, make the leeks. In a saucepan, pour in 2 inches of vegetable oil. Turn the heat to medium-high. Break off a piece of leek and add it to the pot; if it bubbles rapidly, it\u2019s ready to fry.\n3. Working in small batches, add a handful of the leeks at a time to the oil. Stir occasionally and fry for 15\u201320 seconds until golden brown. Remove and\u2013using tongs\u2013transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Continue on until all the leeks are fried. Pat any excess oil off from the tops of the leeks with a paper towel and season with flaky sea salt. Set aside.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the cooked orzo into shallow bowls and place a piece of cod on top. Arrange the frizzled leeks next to the cod and drizzle with the guanciale chili oil. Sprinkle a few bits of fennel fronds on top if you remember (unlike me\u2026). Enjoy!",

Place the cabbage, red onion, serrano pepper, and cilantro in a large bowl. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pour the lime juice on top.\n2. In a microwave-safe bowl, add the vinegar and sugar. Microwave for 1 minute until the sugar is dissolved. Let stand for 5\u201310 minutes.\n3. Add the mayonnaise and whisk until completely smooth.\n4. Pour the dressing over the cabbage and toss to combine. Taste and season to your preferences. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.\n\n**Prepare the jalape\u00f1o-avocado cream cheese:**\n\n1. Turn on your oven\u2019s broiler to high.\n2. Place the red onion and jalape\u00f1os in a small oven-proof skillet or baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil. Transfer to the oven under the broiler. Broil for 3\u20135 minutes (depending on the intensity of your broiler) until the peppers begin to blister and blacken. Remove and set aside.\n3. Combine the avocado, cilantro, lime juice, charred jalape\u00f1o, and red onion in a food processor. Place the cream cheese on top and pulse until completely smooth and creamy. Taste and season with salt. Pour into an airtight jar or a bowl and cover tightly with foil. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.\n\n**Make the cod:**\n\n1. Pour oil into a large pot, about 3 inches deep, and heat the oil to 350\u00ba\u2013375\u00baF. Note: If you don\u2019t have a deep fat thermometer, use an instant-read meat thermometer, provided the stem is long enough! You\u2019ll want to regularly check the oil\u2019s temperature and ensure you stay at a consistent 350\u00baF\u2013375\u00baF.\n2. Pat the cod pieces dry and season lightly with salt. Set aside.\n3. Combine the flour, chili powder, salt, baking powder, paprika, cayenne powder, and garlic powder in a bowl.\n4. Pour in the beer and whisk until completely smooth and free of lumps. The batter will be thicker than cream but still a tad runny.\n5. Place all of the cod pieces in the batter and toss to combine.\n6. Using tongs, lift a piece of cod from the batter and lightly shake off any drippy excess batter. Slowly drop it into the hot oil. Fry 4\u20136 pieces at a time, depending on the width of your pot. Be sure not to overcrowd the pot! Cook for 3\u20134 minutes until golden brown all over. Use a slotted spoon to transfer a paper towel-lined plate. Continue frying in batches, checking and adjusting the temperature periodically.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Arrange radishes, cucumber, red onion, cilantro, sliced jalape\u00f1o, and lime wedges on a serving platter.\n2. To assemble the tacos, smear a spoonful of the jalape\u00f1o-avocado cream cheese onto a warm tortilla. Place a few cod nuggets on top and finish with a spoonful of slaw. Sprinkle minced red onion and cilantro on top. Add one or two slices of jalape\u00f1o on top for extra heat, if you like. Serve cucumber, lime wedges, and radishes on the side. Enjoy!\n\n**Notes:**\n\nFor the recipe, you\u2019ll use cilantro in the slaw, cream cheese, and for serving. Buy just 1 nice-sized bunch and divide it into 3 for each component.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to buy just 1 red onion (use half of it for the slaw, and the remaining half is used for the cream cheese and for serving).\n\n**Nutrition:**\n\nCalories: 304kcal | Carbohydrates: 34g | Protein: 16g | Fat: 12g | Sodium: 351mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 5g | Vitamin C: 17mg",

Transfer half of the beetroot cure to the centre of the film and spread it to match the size of the salmon. Place the salmon on top and cover it with the remaining cure mixture, making sure to spread it over the top and all sides of the fish.\n\n**3.** Tightly wrap the salmon in the cling film and place a weight on top of the fillet. Refrigerate for 48 hours. (While pressing the salmon is not necessary, it can increase the contact between the fillet and the cure).\n\n**4.** After two days, remove the salmon from the container, unwrap it over the sink, wash off all the beetroot cure, and pat dry. Re-wrap the salmon in fresh cling film and store it in the refrigerator for up to one week, or vacuum pack it and store it for up to three weeks. (Once cured, handle the salmon gently as it becomes more fragile. For the cleanest cuts, use a very sharp knife when slicing.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to prepare Fennel Slaw:**\n\n**1.** In a mixing bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, mustard, the juice of one lemon, and lemon zest to make the dressing.\n\n**2.** In another bowl, mix together sliced fennel, sliced onion, and grated carrot to form the slaw.\n\n**3.** Just before serving, combine the dressing with the slaw mixture. Toss until the slaw is evenly coated with the dressing.",

        "recipe_comment":"# Sesame Salmon Sushi Bowls\n\nThese are poke bowl style, but use seasoned sushi rice as the base. If you would rather make this as a poke bowl, skip the sushi rice section and just use plain white rice. You can easily customize these with whatever extra toppings you like.\n\n**Original Recipe**: [https:\/\/craftycookbook.com\/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls\/](https:\/\/craftycookbook.com\/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls\/)\n\n**Time:** 50 mins\n\n**Servings:** 2 XL bowls (as pictured) or 3-4 smaller servings\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n*For Sushi Rice:*\n\n* 1 1\/2 cups medium grain sushi rice\n* 1 3\/4 cups warm water\n* 6 tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar *(This should have no calories. If it has calories, the vinegar is already seasoned with sugar and salt.)*\n* 2 tbsp white sugar\n* 1 1\/2 tsp table salt\n\n*For Sesame Salmon:*\n\n* 6-10 oz sushi quality salmon (pictured is 5 oz per bowl)\\*\\*\n* 2 green onions\n* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil\n* 1 tbsp soy sauce\n* 1 tsp toasted white sesame seeds\n\n*To Finish Bowls:*\n\n* 1\/2 medium-sized ripe avocado, optional\n* \\~1\/2 cup shelled, frozen edamame, optional\n* \\~1\/4 cup thinly sliced red onion, optional\n* \\~1\/4 cup daikon sprouts, optional\n* other veggies such as carrots, cucumber, nori, bean sprouts, etc optional\n\n\\*\\*I purchase fish marked for sushi\/sashimi from a Japanese grocery store, but this isn't the only option available.\n\n**To Prepare Sushi Rice:**\n\n1. The rice takes about 50 minutes to prepare, but has a lot of hands-off time. The salmon and veggies for this meal can be prepared as the rice cooks. Optionally, you can substitute plain white rice to make this recipe as a poke bowl instead.\n2. Place the rice in a large pot (that has a lid). Rinse and drain the rice until the water runs clear, at least 3 times (rinse the rice even if the bag says it's \"prewashed\"). Drain as much water as possible.\n3. Add 1 3\/4 cup lukewarm water to the pot, close with the lid, and place on the stove top.\n4. Heat over medium-high heat until the water begins to boil, once boiling cook over medium-high heat for 4 minutes, then reduce heat to very-low and simmer for 15 minutes.\n5. After simmering, remove from heat and let the pot stand undisturbed for another 15 minutes.\n6. Scoop the rice into a large non-metallic bowl. Dust with sugar and salt, then pour over the rice vinegar. Using a rice spatula or non-stick spatula mix everything together and break up all the clumps of rice. Mix until every grain of rice is separated and coated in vinegar, the sugar and salt should dissolve completely. Don't worry if the rice seems too wet at this point, that will go away as it cools.\n7. Allow the rice to cool uncovered, mixing occasionally, until it reaches room temp (about 15 minutes). You can speed this process along by fanning the rice if desired. The rice should be slightly sticky once it's cooled.\n\n**To Prepare Veggies:**\n\n1. Boil the edamame per package instructions (typically 3-4 minutes), then drain and season lightly with salt.\n2. Peel the red onion and cut it in half, then slice as thin as possible until you have about 1\/4 of a cup.\n3. Clip daikon sprouts from their base and thoroughly rinse.\n4. Prepare the avocado last, as it will brown if exposed to air for too long. Peel and thinly slice the 1\/2 avocado as desired.\n\n**To Prepare Sesame Salmon:**\n\n1. Rinse the salmon thoroughly, then pat dry with paper towels. Using a very sharp chef's knife, slice the salmon into strips. Once in strips, slice again into cubes. You do not need a sushi knife, a sharp chef's knife will do. I make my cubes about 1\/2 inch in size, but choose any size you prefer.\n2. Remove the root tip of the green onions and discard, then slice as thinly as possible (green and white portions). After slicing, use your hands to separate the rings of the white portion as much as possible.\n3. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the cubed salmon, green onion, sesame oil, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. Mix until fully combined. *If not using immediately, cover and return to the fridge until ready to use.*\n\n**To Finish Bowls:**\n\n1. Divide the sushi rice evenly into the serving dishes, creating a wide, flat base.\n2. Spoon the salmon into the serving bowls, discarding any sauce that remains in the mixing bowl. \n3. Top with veggies as desired, then serve immediately with a spoon and chopsticks.\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear your feedback\/suggestions\/modifications in the comments section!**",

Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi and cook until they float to the top. Drain and rinse thoroughly with water to keep them from sticking.\n\n**Fry the shrimp:**\n\n1. Pat the shrimp dry and season them with garlic pepper.\n2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add 2 tablespoons butter. As soon as the butter is melted and bubbly, add the shrimp and arrange them into an even layer. Fry without moving for 3 minutes. Flip and cook 1\u20132 minutes more. Do not overcook! It\u2019s alright if the shrimp aren\u2019t all perfectly opaque. Transfer them to a large bowl.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into the pot. Adjust the heat to medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, for 8\u201310 minutes until it begins to brown around the edges and soften completely.\n2. Add the hot honey and stir to coat the onions. Add the flour and stir to coat. Cook for 1\u20132 minutes.\n\n**Simmer the sauce:**\n\n1. Slowly stir in the broth or water. Continue stirring until completely smooth. Once the liquid begins to bubble, stir in the cream and parmesan. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes if you like. Simmer for 5 minutes.\n\n**Finish the shrimp and gnocchi:**\n\n1. Stir in the lemon juice and zest and the fresh parsley. Add the shrimp and gnocchi and let bubble in the sauce for 5 minutes just to warm the gnocchi and shrimp. Taste and season once more.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the shrimp and gnocchi into shallow bowls. Garnish with more parsley if you like. Enjoy!",

        "recipe_comment":"Named for this dish's inspiration.\n\nServing size: 2-3 crepes per person.\n\nMakes 6 \u2013 8\u201d Crepes Katherine\n\nFor the crepes:\n\nThe crepes may be made in advance and heated slightly in a warm oven before filling\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 4 Large eggs\n* Milk \u2013 Measure the volume of the eggs and use an equal volume of milk\n* Flour \u2013 Half the volume of the eggs\n* Dash of salt\n* Butter (or non-stick cooking spray)\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Blend eggs, milk, flour, and salt together until lumps are removed and allow to rest refrigerated in an airtight container for one hour, up to overnight, before cooking.\n2. Preheat non-stick saute pan over medium-low heat. Whisk or shake the egg mixture until completely combined.\n3. For each crepe, melt a very thin slice of butter in the heated pan swirling until the bottom of the pan is coated, or spray the bottom of the pan with non-stick cooking spray.\n4. Pour roughly a quarter of a cup of the batter onto the pan, tilting and rotating the pan off the heat to ensure a very thin layer of batter is completely covering the bottom of the pan. Additional batter may be added as needed, but should only be done within the first few moments following the initial pour.\n5. Return the pan to the heat and allow to cook for 1-2 minutes, until the crepe is able to slide freely in the bottom of the pan.\n6. Using a spatula, flip the crepe and cook the other side for 15 seconds. When finished cooking remove from pan and return pan to heat for next crepe.\n\nFor the salmon mousse filling:\n\nThe filling may be made in advance and kept in a covered refrigerated container until used. The filling may be then used chilled or heated.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 10 oz. uncooked salmon, or 8 oz of cooked or smoked salmon. If using uncooked salmon, then the salmon should be cooked and skin and bones removed before using in the mousse. The salmon may be cooked however is preferred, but seasoning should be kept to a minimum\n* 4 oz cream cheese, softened to room temperature\n* \u00bd tsp salt (or salt to taste if the salmon is already seasoned with salt)\n* \u00bd tsp olive oil\n* \u00bd tsp minced garlic (or 1 clove, minced)\n* Juice of \u00bd lemon (about 2 Tbsp)\n* 1 tsp fresh or dried dill\n* Other optional seasonings include black pepper, cayenne, celery salt, onion salt. Each added to taste.\n* Optional mix-ins include diced pepper (bell or poblano), diced or minced onion or shallot, thin-sliced scallions, diced celery\n\nDirections:\n\n1. Using a hand mixer or blender, combine the salmon, cream cheese, salt, olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice,  into a puree. If using a hand mixer, the cream cheese should first be mixed before adding the salmon and other ingredients.\n2. If using a blender, empty the now pureed salmon mousse into a small mixing bowl. Stir in dill and other seasonings, to taste.\n3. The optional mix-ins can be folded into the mousse directly or arranged on top of the mousse after it has been spread on a crepe, before the crepe is folded.\n\nFor the hollandaise sauce:\n\n* 1 cup of hollandaise sauce may be prepare using any preferred method. A dash of white wine may be added to the prepared sauce. The sauce should be heated at the moment of plating as most of the heat of the dish will be coming from the sauce.\n\nFor the asparagus:\n\n* 3-8 spears of asparagus per plate should be cooked per any preferred method. Thinner spears may be cooked directly in a saut\u00e9 pan while thicker spears may be oven-baked, or parboiled then sauteed.\n\nFor the crab:\n\n* 2-4 Tbsp of cooked and shredded crab per person. Canned crab meat may be used if fresh isn\u2019t available. This can be any preferred type of crab and may be optionally coated lightly with melted butter. 1 cluster of snow crab legs provides enough for two plates.\n\nFinal preparation and plating:\n\n1. For each crepe, lay the crepe flat and spread a layer of the salmon mouse thinly on one half of the crepe surface. Add any optional ingredients on top of the salmon mousse spread. After spreading, fold the unspread side of the crepe over the top of the spread side to form a semi-circle of the crepe filled with salmon mouse. Fold that semi-circle once more to form a quarter circle.\n2. Artfully arrange the crepes on the plates, typically overlapped.\n3. Pour the hollandaise sauce over the crepes arrangement on each plate, carefully avoiding pouring too much.\n4. Artfully arrange the asparagus spears on the hollandaise sauce over the middle of the crepes.\n5. Place 2-4 Tbsp of crab meat in the center of each arrangement of asparagus spears. Garnish with fresh parsley.\n6. Serve and enjoy!",

Finely chop the scallions, garlic and ginger. Add half the sunflower oil to a pot on a medium heat. When it has come up to temperature add the scallions and cook for about three minutes. The oil will bubble as the water cooks out of them. Make sure they do not brown. Add the ginger, star anise and cinnamon and cook for another two minutes, stirring every so often, before adding the garlic and continuing to cook.\n\n2.) In a bowl combine the gochugaru, sugar, black sesame seeds and chilli flakes. one tbsp. of chilli will give you a milder r\u0101yu. If you like more of a kick you can add an extra spoonful. Add the mixture in the the pot and top off with the remainder of the oil. Stir well, and cook over a low to medium heat on a gentle and constant simmer for 12 - 15 minutes, taking care not to allow anything to burn or brown too much.\n\n3.) Add the tamari and the rice wine vinegar and stir. Turn the heat off and allow to cook before placing in a sterilised jar. This should keep in the fridge for a few weeks.\n\n4.) Remove scallops from the fridge to come to room temperature. Add oil and butter to a pan on a high heat. Pat them dry and season with coarse salt and pepper before placing in the pan flat side down. Push them down slightly and cook for about two minutes until a deep golden colour. Turn and cook or another minute or two. Baste with the butter. They should be springy to the touch and just warm in the centre when tested with a metal skewer.\n\n5.) Add a tbsp. of the chilli oil to a plate and arrange three scallops around it. Spoon some of the chunkier pieces of the r\u0101yu over the top and season. A squeeze of lemon juice and some grated zest elevates the dish.",

        "recipe_comment":"Marinated mussels served with big crispy fries seem to be Belgium's national dish. The mussel season just started in Europe and we took a chance on making Moules Frites at home. Turns out, it's not as difficult as thought, but tastes better than anticipated, for I usually am not a big fan of mussels.\n\n**Enjoy the recipe and** [**United Cuisines on YouTube!**](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fxzYaCMICGw)\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n*Classic Belgian mussels*\n\n\\- 1 onion\n\n\\- fresh mussels \\[3 lb \/ 1.4 kg\\]\n\n\\- butter \\[2.5 oz \/ 70 g\\]\n\n\\- 1 branch of celery\n\n\\- ground black pepper \\[1\/2 tbsp \/ 5 g\\]\n\n\\- pinch of salt\n\n\\- a handful of parsley (optional)\n\n*Crispy Belgian fries*\n\n\\- mealy, high-starch potatoes, such as Bintje \\[1 lb \/ 450 g\\]\n\n\\- rendered beef fat\/tallow \\[1.1 lb \/ 500 g\\]\n\nServings: 2\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n*Belgian \u201cmosselen natuur\u201d*\n\n1. Wash and clean mussels in cold water. Remove their \u201cbeards\u201d\/fibers, place them in a bowl with water and set aside. INFO: Fresh mussels are still alive and should be closed. Tap them against each other, when open and they should close. If not, discard them, together with those whose shells are broken\n2. Dice onions and celery. Chop parsley\n3. Use (enamel) pots with handles and high sides. Place over medium heat, melt the butter and saut\u00e9 the diced onion and celery for around 5 minutes\n4. Mix in the ground black pepper and increase the heat to high\n5. Grab as many mussels as you can by hand and quickly transfer them into the pot. Don\u2019t fully drain the water!\n6. Give your mussels a good mix, distributing the veggies among them, put on the lid and let cook over for 7 minutes. The mussels closest to the pot\u2019s bottom, will open up and cook first. Hence, it\u2019s important that you mix your mussels by shaking the pot without opening its lid. Do this 3x in those 7 minutes of cooking\n7. The mussels should have all opened up and be cooked by now. Turn off the heat, mix in the parsley and keep the lid on, whilst we prepare your Belgian fries of your Moules Frites! INFO: Don\u2019t eat mussels that didn\u2019t open. Discard them!\n\n*Belgian fries* \n\n1. Wash and peel the potatoes, before cutting them into 11-12mm \\[0.45 inch\\] thick fries. Transfer into a cold water bath and let soak for 30 minutes\n2. Drain the fries, spread them over a baking sheet, that you covered with some kitchen towels and properly dab your potatoes dry. INFO: Belgian fries shall be fried twice: once on low and once on high temperature.\n3. Place the beef tallow into a deep pot and let melt over medium-high heat\n4. Once the oil temperature hits 140\u00b0C \\[280\u00b0F\\], drop the first batch of fries in there. Don\u2019t overcrowd the pot and mix well right away. Let fry for 5 minutes\n5. The surface of your fries will turn a bit white-ish in color: those are burst starch granules that start to gelatinize. Now it\u2019s time to get them out of the hot oil, drain and place them on paper towels on your baking sheet, where they shall cool down for 20 minutes. Fry the other batches while you wait, or take the pot off the heat\n6. Once fries cooled down, bring up the oil\u2019s temperature up to around 190\u00b0C \\[370\u00b0F\\], put one pre-fried batch in, and immediately give them a short stir. Fry for 3-5 minutes, till the potatoes start to slightly float and golden in color\n7. When the potatoes are done, drain and transfer them into a bowl, covered with kitchen paper and immediately salt before mixing them\n8. Enjoy!

        "recipe_comment":"This sauce can have many uses, not just for poke bowls. You can use this for all kinds of seafood, chicken, noodles, tofu, beef, etc. \n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n7g Shiitake Mushrooms\n\n7g (5 inch\/13 cm piece) Kombu\n\n15g Bonito flakes\n\n250mL (1 Cup) water\n\n100g (about 100mL) Sugar\n\n80mL (1\/3 Cup) Balsamic Vinegar\n\n250mL (1 Cup) Soy Sauce\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\n1. Soak Shiitake Mushrooms in cold water for about 6-8 hours ahead of time. Then slice into thin strips. Discard the water and rinse the mushrooms if you see too much dirt in the water.\n2. Bring 1 cup of cold water with the Kombu to a boil, then take out the Kombu and discard. \n3. Add Shiitake Mushrooms, sugar, balsamic vinegar, and soy sauce to the same pot of water. Bring to a boil and turn off the heat. Cover it and let the flavors infuse for 1 hour.\n4. After 1 hour, bring the liquid back to a boil the second time and add in Bonito flakes. Cover it for 5 minutes.\n5. Strain the liquid into a wide pan through a fine mesh. Boil this liquid down to a syrup such that the sauce stays on the plate when you drag the sauce across the plate (see video if you need a reference).\n6. If you reduced the sauce too much and has become too thick, add 2 tablespoons of water (repeat if needed) and mix to make it less viscous on the heat.\n7. Let it cool down a bit first then transfer to a squeeze bottle (if you have one). Otherwise, any container to hold your sauce in the fridge is perfectly fine. \n8. It's important that you WAIT 24 HOURS before using your sauce. At this point, the sauce is too sharp to consume immediately. After 24 hours, all the flavors will round out.\n\nNotes: With regard to extra Kombu, dry Shiitake Mushrooms, and Bonito flakes - these items will last almost indefinitely as long as you store them in a dry and cool place.  The ingredients that you strained out can be consumed if you wish, some people find it unpleasant to eat. The sauce can be kept in the fridge for a very long time.\n\nThis should be fairly simple, but I'll leave [visuals](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ikETKzvG0F0) for reference if necessary.",

        "recipe_comment":"Finally had a friend over for dinner and this was his request. One of the things I've missed most during the pandemic is cooking for people. It's a fun recipe to make for company because once everything is prepped, the cooking part goes really fast. We just ate it with bread and salad but it's great mixed with pasta.  \nMore about it [here](https:\/\/nerdswithknives.com\/the-most-delicious-garlic-butter-shrimp-scampi\/).  \nServes about 4  \n1 - 1 1\/2 pounds extra-large (U 26\/30) shrimp, peeled and deveined  \n1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste  \n1\/4 teaspoon baking soda  \n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided  \n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling  \n3 medium shallots, finely diced (about 1 1\/4 cups)  \n5 large cloves garlic, minced  \nPinch red pepper flakes, optional  \nFreshly ground black pepper  \n3\/4 cup dry white wine or dry vermouth  \n2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest (from 1 large lemon)  \n3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 large lemon)  \n1\/4 cup finely chopped parsley leaves  \nDirections  \nDry the shrimp and add them to a medium bowl; toss well with 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 1\/4 teaspoon baking soda. Return to the refrigerator and allow to sit for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.In a large skillet set over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter and the olive oil. Add the shrimp and arrange into an even layer. Cook until barely pink on bottom side, about 2 minutes. Turn and cook until shrimp are pink on the other side and no longer translucent in the middle, about 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove the shrimp to a plate and set aside.\n\n  \nIf the pan looks dry, add another tablespoon olive oil. Add the shallots and cook, stirring often, until they begin to soften, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until soft and fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add wine and bring to a boil. Let the simmer for 1 minute; add the rest of the butter and swirl and stir the pan until the butter melts. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice and parsley. Return the shrimp to the pan and toss until shrimp are hot and coated in sauce.  \nServe hot, over pasta or with crusty bread for soaking up the sauce.",

Clean and peel your shrimp down to its meat and, even though controversial for ceviche, we suggest that you poach it in boiling saltwater for 2 minutes. Simply to be 100% safe. Immediately transfer the cooked shrimp in ice-cold water, which will quickly stop the cooking process and help your shrimp to stay tender.\n6. Cut the shrimp into small bite-size pieces and transfer into a **glass** bowl\n7. Pour in lime juice and add all other ingredients. Sprinkle with the juice of half an orange and salt to taste\n8. Mix thoroughly and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit in fridge for 1-2 hours\n9. Serve with plantain chips, or if you can't find those, tortilla nacho chips go well with it, too.

The fish is both juicy and tender, and is infused with the aromatic flavor of the hot scallion oil.

Have the fish gutted and descaled (most fishmongers do that for free).\n2. Score the fish at a 45-degree angle for about three to four times on both sides. This will help the fish to cook through quickly and absorb more flavors.\n3. Place 10 ginger slices inside the cut and the fish belly. Ginger is not only aromatic, it can also get rid of fishy smell. Place the fish on top of several scallion pieces on the plate so the fish will not touch the plate directly.\n4. Bring the water to a rolling boil, then steam the fish over high heat for about 8 to 12 minutes (1-1.5lbs) depending on the size of your fish.\n5. Make the seafood sauce using soy sauce, sesame oil, black vinegar, water, salt, and sugar.\n6. When the time is up, discard all the liquid in the plate because that is the source of the bad fishy taste. Add the seafood sauce around the fish following the edge of the plate and spread the scallion strips on top of the fish.\n7. Fry the scallions in 3 tbsps of oil over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Pour the hot oil over the fish. Enjoy! (I also used dried chilies and sichuan peppercorns in the oil to add a hint of spiciness and numbing sensation, but these two ingredients are optional.)",

        "recipe_comment":"I LOVE clam chowder, it\u2019s frequently my order if it\u2019s on the menu, and back in the day I used to crack open the canned stuff for a quick dinner. Once I started making lots of homemade soups I found that I couldn\u2019t go back to canned soup anymore, which was a bummer because I also didn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of getting and handling fresh clams to make clam chowder myself. \n\nThis recipe uses canned clams and it\u2019s the perfect middle ground in my opinion! Canned clams are an excellent source of iron, and they are cheap and last for a long time in the pantry! \n\n# Ingredients\n\n* 2  6.5 oz cans of clams\n* 1  8 oz bottle of clam stock (clam juice) \\*see note\n* 2 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled and cut into \\~1 cm cubes \\*see note\n* 4 strips of thick cut bacon (or 6 regular strips)\n* 1 large white onion, diced\n* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic\n* 2 cups whole milk (can sub non-dairy)\n* \u00bc cup all-purpose flour\n* \u2154 cup corn (from one cobb, or sub canned)\n* 1 tbsp fresh thyme\n* \u00bd cup shredded carrots (optional)\n* 1 bay leaf (optional)\n* Salt &amp; fresh cracked black pepper\n\n# Instructions\n\n1. Strain the clams over a measuring cup, reserving the liquid (should get about 1 cup total). Combined with the 8 oz bottle there will be 2 cups of clam stock, set this aside.\n2. Heat a large, wide pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Cut the bacon into bite-sized pieces and cook it until it reaches your desired level of doneness (I like to let some get crispy and pull some off a little sooner). Remove to a paper towel lined plate and leave the drippings in the pot. \n3. Add the onions to the pot and cook in the bacon drippings until they soften, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. (Add some extra olive oil if the bacon drippings don\u2019t coat the bottom of the pot)\n4. Add the potatoes, garlic, 1 tsp salt, and \u00bc tsp pepper to the pot. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently.\n5. Dust the flour evenly over the contents of the pot and cook, stirring frequently, for another \\~3 minutes.\n6. Add the milk and clam stock and stir until well-mixed. Add the bay leaf, thyme, carrots, and corn. Bring to a boil over high heat, and then reduce heat to medium-low to simmer until the potatoes are cooked through, about 15 minutes (stirring occasionally to prevent potatoes from sticking to the pan's bottom). Add more salt and pepper to taste.\n7. Add the clams and bacon bits to the soup 2-3 minutes before serving. Remove the bay leaf and serve the soup topped with more thyme and fresh cracked black pepper.\n\n# Notes\n\n* Serve in bread bowls or alongside crusty bread for dipping.\n* Dicing the potatoes into small (\\~1 cm) chunks is critical to the texture of the soup, the outsides of the pieces dissolve and contribute to the creaminess of the soup. If cut too large this won't be as effective.\n* Clam stock (clam juice) can usually be found near the canned clams at the grocery store in 8 oz glass bottles.\n\nHope you guys like this one!

Rinse calamari rings then thoroughly pat dry, removing as much moisture as possible.   \n\n2. Begin boiling a large pot of salted water for the pasta and cook per package directions for al dente while completing the other steps. Drain pasta (do not rinse) and return to covered pot to keep warm until needed.  \n\n3. Warm a large skillet with \u00bd tbsp of olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the panko and toast until it is golden brown and crispy. Set aside in a small bowl when done and wipe the pan clean.   \n \n4. In the same skillet begin warming 2 tbsp of olive oil over medium\/medium-high heat.  Once the oil is hot add the calamari and cook, stirring occasionally, until the calamari is cooked through (about 5 minutes). The calamari pieces should shrink and become more firm as they cook. Remove them from the skillet and cover with foil to keep warm, do not wipe the skillet clean.  \n\n5. Reduce heat to medium and add the 4 tbsp of butter. Once hot, add the shallot and cook for about 2 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for another 2 or so, stirring frequently.   \n \n6. Add the white wine to the skillet and bring to a boil. Allow the mixture to cook down for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally,  until most of the wine has boiled away. Season with \u00bd tsp of salt.  \n\n7. Remove from heat and add the pasta and calamari to the skillet. Mix well, then add the basil or thyme and breadcrumbs and toss further (reserving a small bit of breadcrumbs and herbs for garnish). Plate then garnish with remaining breadcrumbs and herbs, serve immediately.  \n\n **Note**\\- You can find calamari rings in the frozen seafood section. If you can\u2019t find them at your usual store, check an Asian grocery store.",

Add Oil to pan and turn on medium heat.\n2. Add flour and continue to stir, watching close, until the mixture (Roux) has turned a dark chocolate color.F\n3. Add Onions, Bell Pepper and Celery and stir until translucent.\n4. Add Sausage, mix together for 3 minutes.\n5. Add Spices and stir together.\n6. Slowly add stock, stirring all the time. Add Bayleaves and fresh Garlic.\n7. Turn the heat down to a low roll and cover.\n8. Allow to simmer like this for 90 Minutes.\n9. While simmering organize rice and any other side dishes.\n10.

I used a Thiyal tamarind-coconut curry paste!)\n* \u00bd teaspoon crushed red pepper optional\n* 1 teaspoon chili powder optional\n* 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock\n* 1 cup coconut milk\n* 1 pound scallops side muscle removed\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Cilantro or parsley leaves optional, for garnish\n* Red pepper flakes optional, for garnish\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Char the Tomatoes:\n\n* Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high. Once very hot and shimmering, add the tomatoes, cut-side down, and cook without moving for 3-5 minutes. Once charred, flip and cook an additional 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n## Brown the Curry Paste:\n\n* Melt the butter into the pot and add the coconut paste. Lightly mash it with the back of your spoon and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the crushed red pepper and chili powder, if using, and lightly saut\u00e9 until fragrant, about 45 seconds.\n\n## Simmer the Sauce:\n\n* Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Taste and season to your preferences. Reduce heat to medium and add the coconut milk. Allow to bubble on medium heat for 10 minutes. Do not allow the sauce to reduce too much or to boil too hard.\n\n## Cook the Scallops:\n\n* While the sauce simmers, pat the scallops dry and remove the side muscle. Season liberally with salt and pepper.\n* Gently place the scallops in the broth in an even layer and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 4-5 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the scallops to rest for 1 minute. Remove the lid. If the scallops are opaque, serve immediately. If they need to cook a little longer, cover again and allow the residual heat from the broth to cook them. Do not overcook them!\n\n## To Serve:\n\n* Ladle the coconut curry broth and charred tomatoes into a shallow bowl and arrange the scallops in the broth. Garnish with fresh cracked pepper, red pepper flakes, and herbs like cilantro or parsley leaves, if desired. Serve with cooked basmati rice or naan bread, if desired. Enjoy!\n\nJust as a note - if you\u2019re on an electric stove, bring your heat down a few minutes before you add the scallops!!",

Once hot, add the shallot and cook for 3-4 minutes until golden brown and softened.\n* Add the garlic and chili peppers to the skillet and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Do not burn the garlic! Immediately transfer to a bowl.\n\n## Cook the Mushrooms:\n\n* Heat another teaspoon or two of oil in the skillet and add the mushrooms.

        "recipe_comment":"Excited to share a dish I grew up with! \n\nThe salmon is a super easy weeknight recipe that\u2019s ready in under 25 minutes, and the sauce is something my parents always have a stash of in their fridge, since it pairs well with a ton of different dishes.\n\nHere's the [video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7DKlH4K1ANA&amp;&amp;list=PLvd5bo3J-_kq4FcYVCOK6ZR87dCGDqrSH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s) for a walkthrough.\n\n# Sourcing Salmon Sustainably\n\nFor this specific recipe, my parents bought Atlantic salmon. With regards to Atlantic vs Pacific, farmed or wild-caught, there\u2019s no right or wrong choice, but my parents have a slight preference for Atlantic salmon, which nowadays are primarily farmed.\u00a0\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s most consumed species of fish, salmon is a massive industry, with several million tons sold every single year, and tons of complexity surrounding how we source it in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way.\u00a0\n\nAs consumers, an easy way to do our part is by making sure we vote with our wallets. Monterey Bay Aquarium in California runs a free website and mobile app called \"Seafood Watch\" which has a ton of recommendations on how to choose and purchase seafood in ways that have the least environmental impact.\n\n# Salmon + Chinese communities in the west\n\nAs I was researching this recipe, I felt like it was important to share how salmon and fishing helped form some of the first Chinese communities in the West.\n\nDuring the Gold Rush, tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants, mostly from Guangzhou, flocked to California enticed by the promise of the G\u0101m S\u0101an, or gold mountain in Cantonese, although many were forced out of mining work due to discrimination.\u00a0\n\nUndeterred, a group of experienced fishermen found their own gold in abalone and other fish along the Monterey coast. Known as China Point by locals, Chinese immigrants proudly sparked the first large scale commercial fishing industry in California, supplying fish and shellfish to countries all over the world.\u00a0\n\nDuring and after the Gold Rush and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, many Chinese immigrants relocated to Seattle, Vancouver, and surrounding areas to work for salmon canneries and on fishing boats, doing the difficult work of supplying and processing most of the world\u2019s salmon at the time.\n\nToday, the once thriving Chinese enclave in Monterey no longer exists, but in spite of periods of intense discrimination and oppression, Seattle and Vancouver are still homes to some of the largest Chinese communities abroad.\n\n## THE RECIPE\n\nOverview\n\n* Prep Time: 10 min\n* Total Time: 25 min\n* Yield: 4 servings\n\nIngredients for Salmon\n\n* 1.5 lb **salmon**\n* 1 **egg**\n* **white pepper** (to taste)\n* 3 tbsp **cornstarch**\n* 2 tbsp **corn oil**\n* 0.50 tbsp **rice cooking wine**\n* **garlic salt** (to taste)\n\nDipping Sauce\n\n* 1 tbsp **sugar**\n* 0.50 tbsp **vinegar**\n* 2 tbsp **light soy sauce**\n* 0.25 tsp **chili sauce** (to taste)\n* 2 tbsp **boiling water** (very important)\n\nOptional Garnish\n\n* **cilantro**\n* **broccoli**\n\n# Step 1 - Cut salmon\n\nThis is totally optional, but if you're planning on garnishing the salmon with anything (like cilantro) or serving it with any vegetables (like broccoli), then it's best to cut it before the salmon (for sanitation).\n\nTo make our **salmon** (1.5 lb) fillets, make diagonal cuts about 2 cm apart. The diagonal cuts help increase the surface area of the fillets, which leads to a faster cook and less moisture loss.\n\n# Step 2 - Coat salmon\n\nSpread the fillets out on the cutting board, and sprinkle **white pepper** on each side. The white pepper helps counter some of the \"fishy\" taste of the salmon, which has a slightly negative connotation in Chinese cuisine.\n\nWe'll crack and mix our **egg(s)** (1) into a bowl, and spread out **cornstarch** (3 tbsp) on a plate.\n\nCoat each side of each salmon fillet first in the egg, and then the cornstarch. Make sure each side is evenly coated.\n\nThis coating helps the salmon retain its juices, and also add some delicious crunchy\/crispiness when it's cooked.\n\n# Step 3 - Cook salmon\n\n**Heating the wok**\n\nWe\u2019ll set our stove to medium high and let our wok heat up.\n\nUnlike other Chinese recipes, with salmon, it\u2019s important that the wok gets hot enough but not too hot. It\u2019s difficult to give an exact amount of time, since it depends a lot on your stove and cookware.\n\nMy dad relies on his own intuition that he\u2019s developed over 50 years of cooking. For the rest of us, he waited about 2-3 minutes on this current setup.\n\n**Cook the salmon**Then, we\u2019ll add **corn oil** (2 tbsp), and swirl it around the wok.\n\nThe wok and the oil should be hot enough once the oil starts shimmering, or making ripples.\n\nOnce this happens, we\u2019ll add our salmon to the wok.\n\nMy dad had just enough room for 8 fillets, so try not to overcrowd your wok and consider cooking in multiple batches if necessary.\n\nThe total cooking time for the salmon also varies depending on how hot your stove is, how thick each fillet is, and what type of pan or wok you\u2019re using.\n\nOn my dad\u2019s current setup, which has less heat output than a gas stove, he cooked each fillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, generally not flipping the salmon over more than once.\n\nFor a visual cue, once the salmon fillet starts to turn more white \/ yellow-ish, you can flip it.\n\nYou should be able to tell if the salmon is done if it easily flakes. If you wanted to get more precise, you can also insert an instant-read food thermometer into the thickest part of the salmon.\n\n**Other tips**\n\nAs long as it\u2019s cooked enough, the rest is just a lot of trial and error to find the texture of salmon that\u2019s perfect for you. My dad tends to prefer salmon that\u2019s more medium or well-done, so if you prefer something more rare, then adjust accordingly.\n\nKenji from the Food Lab has a great blog post and video with a bunch of helpful tips on how to pan fry salmon. Not all of these tips apply to this specific recipe, but it\u2019s still a great resource, and I\u2019ve linked to it in our description.\n\n# Step 4 - Add flavors, cover wok\n\nAdd **garlic salt** to the fillets.\n\nThen, we'll add **rice cooking wine** (0.50 tbsp). We should have the lid for the wok within reach, because we\u2019ll be covering the wok immediately after we pour the cooking wine in. We\u2019ll only be covering the wok for about 20 to 30 seconds before we take the lid off.\n\n# Step 5 - Uncover, plate, garnish\n\nUncover the wok, and turn the heat off. Transfer the salmon fillets to a plate, and add any garnish you'd like.\n\n# Step 6 - Create sauce\n\nTo make the sauce, mix together **sugar** (1 tbsp), **vinegar** (0.50 tbsp), **light soy sauce** (2 tbsp), **boiling water** (2 tbsp), and **chili sauce** (0.25 tsp). Mix it all together for about 5-10 seconds.Notes:\n\n* If you prefer more spiciness, feel free to add more chili sauce.\n* If you\u2019re wondering why my dad specifically uses boiling water, it\u2019s to help extend the shelf life of the sauce. My parents elaborate on why during our \"Meal Time\".\n\n\\-------\n\n# Our why\n\nI've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.\n\nThanks for reading! Hope you all love the recipe :)",

Slice the fish filet and marinate it for 20 min.\n2. Under medium heat, toast the Sichuan peppercorn for 6 min, toast the dried chilis for 3 min. Take out the spices and blend them into powder separately.\n3. Under high heat, add 1 tbsp of oil and stir fry the veggies for 3 min, add a pinch of salt and sugar, and mix well. Put them at the bottom of the bowl.\n4. Under medium heat, add two tbsps of oil, add two tbsps of chili bean sauce and stir fry for 1 min. Add the ginger slices and garlic, stir fry for 1 min, then add the chili powder and half of the peppercorn powder, stir fry for another min. Add hot water and one star anise, let it cook for 5 min.\n5. When the time is up, turn down the heat to low, add the fish slices into the soup and cook for 4 min. Add salt, sugar, black pepper, and stir gently. Finally, add 2oz starch water to thicken the soup. Mix well.\n6. Place the fish slices on top of the veggies, add the chili soup, garnish it with chopped garlic, green onions, the rest half of the peppercorn powder, and a few dried chilis. Pour 1oz hot oil to release the fragrance of the chili and garlic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes:**\n\n1. The egg whites can help keep the fish tender, the starch water can prevent the fish from being overcooked, a little oil can keep the fish slices from sticking together.\n2. The freshly toasted and blended chili powder and peppercorn powder are much more fragrant than the store bought powder. I highly recommend doing this step for this dish!\n3. I used lettuce, celery, and bean sprouts to add some crunchy texture to the dish. Feel free to use your favorite veggies.\n4. When making the chili soup, make sure to not add the ingredients all at once, otherwise they will overpower one another. Adding them one by one creates multiple layers of fragrance and tastes.",

Most people don't know the secret as to how to tenderize the calamari the night before cooking so that it comes out perfect and with even more flavor.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* The desired amount of calamari, cleaned and cut (I usually make about 1 kg each time, it goes quick!)\n* About 10-15 lemons\n* 4 cups of frying flour\n* Deep frying oil\n* 2 tbsp corn starch (optional)\n* 1 cup of milk\/buttermilk\n* 2 tsp salt\n* 1 tsp pepper\n* 1 tsp smoked paprika\n* 1 tsp Red pepper flakes (optional)\n* Fresh chopped parsley\n\n**Directions**\n\n1. Put all of your cleaned calamari into a large bowl. Squeeze about 5-10 lemons (depending on their size) into the bowl of calamari. Cover with plastic and leave in the fridge overnight.\n2. The following day, take the calamari and rinse off any excess lemon juice. Then, replace the calamari in the same bowl and pour milk\/buttermilk until they are fully submerged. Cover with plastic and leave in the fridge for at least 1 hour.\n3. While waiting, take a bowl and mix your flour with your seasonings. If you like a bit of a kick, use some red pepper flakes. Add corn starch for that extra crispiness.\n4. Take your calamari from the fridge and *individually* dredge each piece in your flour mixture, shaking off any excess. Set them aside for frying.\n5. Preheat your frying oil to 375 degrees F, either in a pot or deep fryer no more than half full.\n6. Fry your calamari for no more than 2-2 1\/2 minutes until golden brown.

I chose 6 oz of cod filets. Rinse them in white vinegar and lemon, to remove any fishy smell.\n\nApply your cajun\/blackening seasoning (to your desired taste or level)and massage well. Set aside for 10 minutes for a quick marinade. Cajun seasoning recipe is large enough for 4-5 servings of fish. \n\nWhen ready, sear your filets on medium-high heat. Place the filet down &amp; don't move it. Allow it to build a crust (approx. for 4 minutes) then flip to other side. Splash some water into your pan and cover. The steam will finish cooking your filets, leaving them juicy and flaky. \n\nRemove filets and begin building your butter sauce in the same pan. Don't clean your pan before this step. Any leftover blackened bits will flavor your sauce. Deglaze your pan with butter, garlic and lemon juice. Whisk until your sauce is glossy. Season to taste and serve over your cod.\n\nPair your cod filets with your favorite side dish, I chose garlic mashed potatoes but creamy polenta or risotto would work too.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nHere's the video recipe https:\/\/youtu.be\/qnqHrmuMQwg",

        "recipe_comment":"In this recipe, I will introduce a technique commonly used in restaurants for preparing curry. To start, we will prepare a curry base gravy, which serves as the foundation for many Indian curries. This versatile and flavourful sauce will be the key ingredient in our Vegetable Balti. Additionally, you can utilize this base gravy in  other curry dishes as well.\n\n**Portions:** 4-6 servings\n\n**Preparation time:** 30 minutes\n\n**Base Gravy cooking time:** 40 minutes\n\n**Vegetable Balti cooking time:** 35 minutes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for Curry Base Gravy:**\n\n\\* 4tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil\n\n\\* 2tbsp cumin seeds (use ground if not available)\n\n\\* 1tbsp coriander seeds (use ground if not available)\n\n\\* 1tbsp ground turmeric\n\n\\* 1\/2tsp red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)\n\n\\* 1tbsp garam masala\n\n\\* 1tbsp paprika\n\n\\* 2 large onions diced\n\n\\* 1 medium carrot diced\n\n\\* 4tsp garlic ginger paste\n\n\\* 400g of chopped tomatoes\n\n\\* 700ml of vegetable stock (plus more if needed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ingredients for Vegetable Balti:**\n\n\\* 2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil\n\n\\* 2 medium-size onions, cut into four then broken apart\n\n\\* 1 green pepper, cut into 8\n\n\\* 1 red pepper, cut into 8\n\n\\* 2 medium-size tomatoes cut into wedges\n\n\\* a handful of white cabbage cut into squares\n\n\\* 10 Okra fingers, tops removed and cut in half\n\n\\* two handfuls of frozen peas\n\n\\* 2 large potatoes, peeled and diced\n\n\\* half of small cauliflower, cut into florets\n\n\\* 1tbsp ginger garlic paste\n\n\\* 2-3 ladles of base curry gravy\n\n\\* 2tbsp of yoghurt\n\n\\* knob of butter (skip if using ghee)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Instructions for Curry Base Gravy:**\n\n**1.** In a large saucepan or pot, heat the ghee or vegetable oil over medium heat.\n\n**2.** Add the cumin seeds and coriander seeds to the hot oil. If you have ground cumin, you can add it later along with the other spices. Saut\u00e9 the cumin and coriander seeds for a minute or until they start releasing their aroma.\n\n**3.** Add the diced onions and carrots to the pan. Cook and stir them for about 5-6 minutes or until the onions become soft and translucent.\n\n**4.** Now, add the garlic ginger paste to the pan. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously, until the raw smell of garlic and ginger disappears.\n\n**5.** Mix in the turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and paprika (if using ground cumin, add it now). Stir everything together to coat the vegetables with the spices evenly.\n\n**6.** Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes or until the tomatoes become soft and start breaking down.\n\n**7.** Pour in the vegetable stock, and give the mixture a good stir. Bring it to a gentle boil.\n\n**8.** Lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pan, and let the curry base gravy cook for about 20-25 minutes. The vegetables should become tender, and the flavours will meld together.\n\n**9.** Once the vegetables are fully cooked, turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down slightly.\n\n**10.** Using a blender or an immersion blender, blend the mixture until you achieve a smooth and thick curry base gravy. If the consistency is too thick for your liking, you can add more vegetable stock to reach the desired thickness.\n\n**11.** Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt or spices if needed.\n\nYour curry base gravy is now ready to use! You can use it immediately in your favourite curry dishes or store it for later use. This flavourful base will enhance the taste of your curries, whether you're preparing vegetarian, chicken, lamb, or any other type of curry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to prepare Vegetable Balti:**\n\n**1.** Heat the ghee or vegetable oil in a Balti pan or a large wok over medium heat. Add the broken apart onions to the pan and stir-fry for a few minutes until they start to soften.\n\n**2.** Toss in the potatoes, green and red peppers, and continue stir-frying for a couple of minutes.\n\n**3.** Add the tomato wedges to the pan and saut\u00e9 briefly until they start to break down and release their juices.\n\n**4.** Incorporate the white cabbage, okra, frozen peas and cauliflower florets into the pan. Stir everything together to mix the vegetables evenly.\n\n**5.** Add the ginger garlic paste and continue to stir-fry for a minute or two, ensuring the vegetables are coated with the paste.\n\n**6.** Pour in the base curry gravy. Start with 2 ladles and adjust the quantity based on how saucy you want the Balti to be.\n\n**7.** Stir everything together and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the vegetables cook in the gravy for about 15-20 minutes or until they are fully cooked but still retain their texture.\n\n**8.** Check the seasoning and add salt or additional spices if needed.\n\n**9.** Stir in the yogurt and mix it well with the vegetables and gravy. This will add a creamy richness to the dish.\n\n**10.** If you're using vegetable oil, add a knob of butter at this stage to enhance the flavours of the Vegetable Balti.\n\n**11.** Once the vegetables are cooked to your liking and the flavours have melded together, turn off the heat. Your Vegetable Balti is now ready to be served! Transfer it to a serving dish, and you can garnish it with chopped fresh coriander leaves if desired. Enjoy this flavourful and aromatic dish with naan, rice, or any bread of your choice. Enjoy!\n\nOriginally posted: [Vegetable Balti](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/vegetable-curry-balti)",

Pour enough water to completely cover the cheese, and soak it for 20 minutes to reduce the saltiness and change the texture of the cheese. When it's ready, remove it from the water and mix it with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, paprika, and turmeric.\n\n**2.** For the sauce, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium-sized pot over medium heat. Add cumin, coriander, and caraway seeds and cook until fragrant, then add sliced garlic and diced onion. Cook until the onions are softened, then add paprika and harissa paste. Cook for another minute and add chopped tomatoes, honey, salt, and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. If the sauce seems too thick, add water. Cook for 10 minutes.\n\n**3.** In the meantime, preheat the oven to 220\u00b0C fan and prepare the vegetables for roasting. Place the diced aubergine in a bowl and marinate it with balsamic vinegar, olive oil, honey, salt, and Ras el Hanout spice blend. Mix well, then add peppers and onions and mix again. The aubergine's spongy texture will soak up all the flavours. Place the vegetables on a tray and roast in the oven for around 20 minutes (Don't overcrowd the vegetables on the roasting tray. Spread them out in a single layer so that they cook evenly and roast to perfection, use two trays if necessary).\n\n**4.** When the sauce is ready, you can blend it or leave it as is. Transfer it to a cast iron pan or other baking dish, add the roasted vegetables to the sauce, and top with the halloumi cheese. Place it in the oven and change the setting to the 220\u00b0C grill. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until the halloumi cheese starts to brown (Be careful not to overcook the Halloumi cheese. It only needs a few minutes under the grill to brown and become crispy. Keep an eye on it and remove it from the oven as soon as it reaches your desired level of doneness).\n\n**5.** Remove from the oven, garnish with parsley or cilantro, and enjoy with your favourite flatbread!

Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add the pearl onions and cook for 3 minutes. Drain and immediately transfer to an ice bath. Once the onions are cool to handle, carefully snip off a sliver of the root end using sharp scissors. Squeeze the top of the onion to pop the onion from its skin. Continue until all the onions are peeled.\n\n**Fry the onions:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and saut\u00e9 for 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until they begin to brown and soften. Season with salt.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. Microwave 2 tablespoons plant-based butter in a bowl until melted. Add the miso paste, brown sugar, rice vinegar, light soy sauce, and chili oil and whisk until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.\n\n**Cook the asparagus:**\n\n1. Add the asparagus spears to the skillet with the onions. Cook for 5 minutes until almost fork-tender.\n\n**Finish the miso-glazed asparagus:**\n\n1. Pour in the miso glaze and turn the heat to medium-high. As soon as it begins to bubble, reduce heat and simmer for 5\u20137 minutes or until the glaze thickens and the asparagus is fork-tender and bright green. Taste and season. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Arrange the asparagus and red onions on a serving platter. Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced scallions. Enjoy!",

Make sure to press the tofu to remove excess water for best results. \n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 block extra firm tofu, 14 \u2013 16 oz, pressed to remove excess water\r\n* 10-12 oz broccoli florets, \\~4 cups\r\n* 3 green onions, greens sliced thin, or topping\r\n* \u00bc cup corn starch\r\n* roasted sesame seeds, optional, for topping\r\n* crushed red pepper flakes, optional, for topping\r\n* veggie oil\r\n\n*For Sauce:*\r\n\n* 2 navel oranges -  zest one orange, juice both oranges, or sub \u2154 cup orange juice\r\n* 3 tbsp honey, sub date syrup for vegan\r\n* \u00bc cup soy sauce\r\n* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic\r\n* \u00bd tbsp ginger paste or freshly grated ginger, or sub \u00bd tsp ground ginger\r\n* 2 tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar\r\n* 2 tbsp corn starch\r\n* sriracha sauce, optional, (for mild \u2013 \u00bd tbsp ; medium \u2013 1 tbsp ; hot \u2013 1.5+ tbsp)\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Cut the tofu into \\~\u00be\u201d cubes. In a large bowl, toss the cubes in the \u00bc cup of corn starch until they have an even, thick coating.\r\n2. Combine the soy sauce and 2 tbsp corn starch in a small saucepan and whisk until fully combined. Then add the rest of the sauce ingredients and mix well. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-low heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer until a thick sauce forms, about 5 minutes. Remove the completed sauce from heat. If you accidentally over-reduce the sauce, just add a splash of water and mix.\r\n3. As the sauce cooks, warm a generous swirl of veggie oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the tofu pieces and cook, turning occasionally, until they are golden and crispy on most sides, about 10 minutes. Remove to a large bowl.\r\n4. Add a little more oil to the pan if needed, and add the broccoli florets. Cook until they brighten in color and just begin to char, about 2 minutes.\r\n5. Pour the orange sauce over the tofu and toss to fully combine, then add the broccoli and toss further.\r\n6. Serve over a bed of rice (I use jasmine rice). Top with green onions and sesame seeds. Add crushed red pepper flakes for extra spice.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Pressing the tofu to remove excess water is very beneficial to the final texture, I strongly recommend pressing your tofu for at least 30 minutes before preparing the recipe. If you don\u2019t own a tofu press, wrap the block in paper towels, set it on a rimmed plate or tray, and place a heavy object on top of it.\r  \n\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear about how it went and any feedback\/modifications if the comments section!**",

Recipe below!\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* Sunflower oil, for frying- 1 eggplant, cut into \u00bd-inch pieces\n* 1 bell pepper, chopped\n* 1 celery stalk, finely chopped\n* \u00bd of large carrot, finely chopped\n* \u00bc cup pine nuts\n* 2 tablespoons brine-packed capers, drained\n* 1 1\/2 teaspoon sugar3 tablespoons white vinegar\n\n**Instructions**\n\n1. Fill a medium-sized frying pan with about a half-inch or sunflower oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is sizzling (you\u2019ll hear a few pops), lower the heat to medium and add the eggplant for about 8 - 10 minutes or until it\u2019s lightly browned on all sides.\n2. Remove the eggplant with a slotted spoon and transfer it to a bowl. If the eggplant looks too oily, you can put paper towels in the bowl to absorb some of the oil like latkes.\n3. Add the chopped bell pepper and cook for about 3 - 5 minutes. Transfer it to the bowl with a slotted spoon and add in both the celery and carrots for about two minutes. They should be crispy. Transfer to the bowl with the slotted spoon again.\n4. Next, remove the oil from the skillet (pouring it into a separate container, never down the drain) and wipe it down with a paper towel. Put all of the vegetables back in over medium heat. Add the pine nuts, capers, sugar, and white vinegar. Cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 5 - 10 minutes. Then, remove from heat and let cool. Add kosher salt to taste and serve at room temperature or the next day.",

In the meantime roast red onions, peppers and paneer cheese. To do so marinate them in 2 tbsp of vegetable oil, a little salt and 1tbsp Korma spice blend. Roast at 220C for around 15 minutes. To save energy I recommend using an air fryer instead of the oven.\n5. Now add coconut milk or cream to the pot and blend the sauce using an immersion blender. Once smooth, check the seasoning and add more salt if necessary, if you like your Korma more on the sweet side add honey instead.\n6. You can combine sauce with roasted vegetables and paneer cheese or serve them as garnish. Serve with rice or naan bread, and add fresh coriander. Enjoy!\n\nBlog post: [Paneer Korma Recipe](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/paneer-korma)",

Peel the shallot and thinly slice it across the short end, creating rings. Separate the rings with your hands.\n2. Warm 1 tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the shallots and cook, stirring frequently, for two minutes. Add the garlic, coleslaw mix, and broccoli slaw mix and cook, stirring frequently, for another minute, then add the soy sauce and cook for one more minute. Remove mixture from heat and transfer to a plate or bowl to cool. (You can jump ahead and prep the sauce for step 4 as the mixture cools, but don\u2019t start the heat)\n3. Once the mixture has cooled, make each spring roll one at a time. Prepare a wide bowl of water, large enough to dip the rice paper. Briefly dip the rice paper, turning it so every part touches the water. Place the rice paper on a clean, smooth surface and fill with \u00bc cup of filling. Roll the spring roll (if you're unfamiliar with this technique, see the video on the website or google how to roll a spring roll). *\\[The rice paper softens more overtime. If it feels rigid, wait a minute and try again. Try to make the rolls as tight and cylindrical as possible, wide\/flat rolls don\u2019t fry as nicely.\\]*\n4. Once the rolls are prepped, prepare the sauce. Combine the cornstarch with \u00bc cup warm water and mix until dissolved. Combine this and all the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan and place over low heat as you pan fry the spring rolls, mixing occasionally. If needed, add a splash of water to the sauce to maintain a silky consistency as it simmers.\n5. Warm 2 tbsp of oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Once hot, add 5 spring rolls (make sure they don\u2019t touch, they will stick together). Pan fry the rolls, turning occasionally, until the outside is crispy, about 3 minutes. Remove to a paper-towel-lined plate and repeat with the next 5 rolls, adding a little more oil if needed. Serve immediately with peanut sauce on the side.\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear how it went + any modifications or feedback you have in the comment section!**",

Gently press the tofu with paper towels to remove excess moisture. If desired, press the tofu in a tofu press or place between paper towels under a heavy object for a few minutes to remove even more moisture. Cut the tofu into \\~\u00be\u201d cubes. Dust the tofu with about 2 tbsp of cornstarch and toss to fully coat.\r\n2. Remove the tops from the Chinese eggplants then quarter them longwise (creating 4 long strips per eggplant). Cut the strips into \u00bd inch pieces to create many small chunks. Dust the eggplant with about 2 tbsp of cornstarch and toss to fully coat. (If using regular eggplant cube into ~3\/4 inch pieces) \r\n3. Combine all of the sauce ingredients and set aside.\r\n4. Heat a swirl of veggie oil over medium-high heat in a wok or large skillet. Add the eggplant chunks and cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggplant is crispy in some places and soft all the way through, about 5-7 minutes. Try to position the eggplant so the cut sides are in contact with the pan. The eggplant will likely absorb the oil, but there\u2019s no need to keep adding more. Once cooked, remove to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.\r\n5. To the skillet, add another generous swirl of veggie oil. Once warm, add the cubed tofu pieces. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tofu is golden and crispy on most sides, about 10 minutes. Once cooked, remove to a plate. Note, using a spatula to flip the pieces is much easier than using tongs.\r\n6. Add a little more oil to the skillet, once warm add the garlic and the whites of the green onion. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring constantly. Add the sauce and mix everything together, then add the tofu and eggplant back to the skillet. Remove from heat and mix everything together. Top with the green onion greens and sesame seeds, serve immediately with white rice.\n\n**If you make this recipe, I'd love to hear your feedback in the comments!**\n\nEdit: To answer a common question, Chinese eggplant are long and skinny compared to \u201cregular\u201d eggplant. This means when you cube them every piece has some skin on it, which helps them hold up better when stir-frying. Also, if your frying pan is not very non-stick you may have issues with the eggplant sticking to the pan, so watch out for that!",

        "recipe_comment":"As cucumbers are in season their abundance and lower price is a perfect time to prepare Cucumber Kimchi. It is a delicious addition to many Asian dishes, perfect for a hot sunny day. Great booster for your gut microbiome as well :)\n\nI recommend you try Vaccum packing for your fermented products as it can save you space and create an anaerobic environment that prevents the development of unwanted pathogens. Here you can find the device and the bags at a good price.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n\\* 700g of cucumbers (pickling variety)\n\n\\* 14g of salt (2% per cucumber weight)\n\n\\* 1 medium-sized carrot cut into 5cm julienne\n\n\\* a handful of chives\n\n\\* 3tbsp of Gochugaru (Korean chilli flakes)\n\n\\* 1,5tbsp of minced garlic\n\n\\* 2tsp of minced ginger\n\n\\* half of the red apple, grated\n\n\\* 1,5tbsp of sugar\n\n\\* 1tsp of minced Saeujeot (Korean salted shrimp)(use more fish sauce if not available)\n\n\\* 1tsp of fish sauce (Use dark soy sauce for vegetarian version)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Prepare cucumbers by removing their ends, then cut them in half lengthways. Now divide into 5cm parts and cut each part 3 times at an angle. Place in the large bowl with julienned carrots and chives then mix in the salt. Rest for 25 minutes.\n2. In the meantime prepare Gochugaru paste by mixing all the remaining ingredients in a separate bowl.\n3. Once cucumbers are ready combine them with paste.\n4. Transfer everything into a jar or a vacuum bag and seal. Leave at room temperature for 2 days then move into the fridge. \n5.  Once chilled, Cucumber Kimchi is ready for consumption. It will develop more flavour over the next few days but it will lose the crunch and the cucumber will become mushier, so I don't recommend it for long time storage like traditional Kimchi.\n\nBlog post: [Cucumber Kimchi](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/cucumber-kimchi)",

Add diced sweet potatoes, carrots, and spices (smoked paprika powder, salt, and black pepper). Stir well. We usually add chili flakes only right before serving so that we can taste the soup without it first.\n4. Finally add the vegetable broth and cook until vegetables are soft and tender. It will usually take 15-20 minutes depending on how small or large you have chopped the veggies.\n5. When your soup is ready, the final step is to turn it into a cream soup. Take your blender and pour in the soup. If according to the manufacturer of your blender you should avoid hot liquid, wait a bit to cool it down before blending.",

        "recipe_comment":"Do you see them? chilling by that chilli sauce? One is about to jump in!\n\nOnion Bhaji is one of my favourite Indian appetisers. I love their crunch and delicious inside. Dip them in a nice sauce and stuff it in your mouth, absolutely fantastic!\n\nSuper easy to prepare, served with various dips like mango chutney, mint yoghurt or chilli sauce. On this occasion I prepared simple chilli sauce from my Indian friend's recipe, try it yourself and you will not regret it.\n\n**Ingredients for 15 Bhajis:**\n\n\\* 4 medium or 2 large white onions, cut in half and sliced\n\n\\* 1 green chilli, seeds removed and finely sliced\n\n\\* 1 medium potato, cut into fine matchsticks\n\n\\* 1tbsp of garlic and ginger paste\n\n\\* a handful of chopped fresh coriander\n\n\\* 1tsp of salt\n\n\\* 1tsp of mild chilli powder\n\n\\* 1tsp of ground coriander\n\n\\* 1tsp of turmeric\n\n\\* 1tsp of ground cumin\n\n\\* 1 large egg (you can skip for the vegan version, reduce the flour by 50g)\n\n\\* 150g (5.3oz) of gram flour (made of chickpeas)\n\n\\* 1L of vegetable oil for deep-fat frying\n\n**Ingredients for chilli sauce:**\n\n\\* 1 red chilli, seeds removed and sliced\n\n\\* 1 red bell pepper, diced\n\n\\* 1 garlic clove\n\n\\* juice of a half lemon\n\n\\* 50ml of water\n\n\\* 1\/4tsp of salt\n\n\\* 1\/4tsp of sugar\n\n\\* 1\/4tsp of ground cumin\n\n**Instructions for Bhajis:**\n\n1. Preheat a deep fat fryer or a small pot with oil to 170C (340F) (you can check pot oil temperature with an electric probe)\n2. Mix sliced onions with potato matchsticks, green chilli, garlic ginger paste, fresh coriander, salt and spices. Do so until all onions are coated with colours.\n3. Mix in one egg to coat the onions then add chickpea flour, combine until no signs of dry flour is left.\n4. Use gloves for protection, take a small amount of Bhaji mix and shape in your hands into a ball (do not compress the mix) put it gently into the hot oil. Cook Bhajis until golden-brown then flip upside down for another minute or so to colour the topside. I recommend using a spider strainer or tongs to remove Bhajis from the oil. Place them onto a kitchen paper to drain excess fat.\n5. Do it in a few batches until all Bhajis are done, serve straight away or reheat in the oven later before serving.\n\n**Instructions for Chilli sauce:**\n\n1. Place all the ingredients in the bullet like this one and blend into a smooth chilli sauce.\n2. Transfer into a bowl to allow air bubbles to escape, then transfer into a serving dish.\n\nSmacznego!\n\nRecipe here originally: [Onion Bhajis](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/onion-bhajis)",

When ready add 2tbsp of sweet soy sauce and glaze all around, set aside on the plate ready for later (chop into cubes).\n2. Stir-fry shallot and mushrooms until cooked through, add sliced cabbage and continue cooking for another minute. Season with 1tbsp of soy sauce and remove from the pan ready for later.\n3. In the deep frying pan bring 400ml of water to boil and whisk in 3tbsp of Gochujang chilli paste. Add Tteok and boil them in the sauce until cooked through (Use the packet instructions as a guide, cook longer if you prefer them softer, it takes around 10 minutes plus for the dry ones)\n4.

Moreover, I reached out to our Greek friends and used their ultra thin Filo \/ Phyllo dough sheets, in order to get a super crisp Kol Borek (Turkish, which translates to \"arm borek\/pastry\").\n\n**Enjoy the recipe and the latest episode of United Cuisines on Youtube!**\n\nINGREDIENTS\n\n* Filo \/ Phyllo dough sheets \\[10 oz \/ 300 g\\]\n* spinach \\[1 lb \/ 450 g\\]\n* Turkish \"white cheese\" or Greek Feta \\[7 oz \/ 200 g\\]\n* vegetable oil \\[1\/3 cup \/ 80 g\\]\n* clarified butter \\[3 oz \/ 90 g\\]\n* 1 medium-sized onion\n* Aleppo chili flakes \\[1 tsp\\]\n* salt &amp; pepper to taste\n* sesame &amp; nigella seeds\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1. Wash and roughly cut the spinach, peel and chop the onion into small cubes\n2. Saut\u00e9 spinach in a pan over medium-low heat with a tablespoon of olive oil. Add the first batch of spinach, which will wilt and considerably shrink in size quickly. Using a kitchen tong, turn it upside down, let wilt, add another batch, and repeat till all the spinach is in the pan. Cook for 3 minutes, mixing and turning multiple times. Transfer into a bowl and let cool down\n3. In the same pan, saut\u00e9 the onion with some olive oil over medium heat for 3-5 minutes, till translucent\n4. Grab the spinach, squeeze the water out of it and transfer the greens into the pan. Combine spinach and onion, season with salt &amp; pepper to taste and mix in a teaspoon of Aleppo peppers\n5. Transfer into the bowl of earlier, let cool down, crumble the white cheese\/Feta over it and combine well\n6. In parallel, put the vegetable oil and clarified butter into a small saucepan  and place it over low heat. Let heat up till the butter is fully melted and set aside\n7. Grease a round oven-safe dish - preferably metal - with the butter-oil mix\n8. Grab one ultra-thin dough\/filo sheet and paint it with the butter-oil, before placing a second sheet on top and greasing it as well\n9. Spread a generous amount of the spinach-cheese filling along the long side of the rectangle. Grab the sheet at the same end where the filling is and start rolling - not too loose, nor too tight. Place it along the rim of the greased oven pan, follow up with the next rolls and spiral inwards till the pan is fully covered\n10. Brush with some more of the butter-oil mix, sprinkle with sesame and nigella seeds and bake at 180\u00b0C\/360\u00b0F on the lower third of your conventional oven for around 45 minutes till golden and crisp. Monitor the process, as baking\/browning can vary strongly depending on your oven\n11.

It's decadent, lightly sweet, a little salty, and works perfectly with anything else you may be serving this year.\n\nPrep Time: 10 minutes\n\nCook Time: 40 minutes\n\nInactive Time: 40 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 1 hour 30 minutes\n\nServings: 10\n\nCalories: 251kcal\n\n## Equipment\n\n* Skillet\n* 9\u00d713 Baking Dish\n* Baking sheet\n\n## Ingredients\n\n* 1 pound challah or brioche bread cut into bite-sized cubes\n* 1 tablespoon olive oil\n* 2 sweet onions peeled and thinly sliced\n* 2 tablespoons butter divided\n* 1 teaspoon sugar\n* 4 ribs celery with leaves trimmed and small-diced\n* 1 tablespoon fresh thyme minced\n* 1 tablespoon fresh sage leaves minced\n* 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary minced\n* 3 cups vegetable stock\n* 2 eggs\n* 4 tablespoons butter melted\n* 2 teaspoons fig miso or white miso\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n* Cooking spray or butter for greasing the baking dish\n\n## Instructions\n\n## Dry out the bread:\n\n* Preheat oven to 200\u00baF. Arrange the diced bread on a baking sheet and transfer to the oven for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, grease a 9\u00d713 baking dish.\n* Remove the bread from the oven and transfer to the prepared baking dish. Turn the heat on the oven to 350\u00baF.\n\n## Caramelize the onions:\n\n* Heat the oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes until they just begin to deepen in color. Sprinkle with salt and reduce heat to medium-low. Continue cooking for 30 minutes or until the onions begin to caramelize. Stir them occasionally, but don\u2019t disturb them too often or else they won\u2019t caramelize.\n* Melt 1 tablespoon butter into the onions and sprinkle the sugar on top. Continue cooking for 10\u201315 minutes until they are fully caramelized.\n* Spoon half of the onions into a bowl and pour the remaining half over the diced bread and toss gently to distribute them evenly.\n\n## Cook the celery:\n\n* Return the skillet to the stovetop over medium heat. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter into the celery and cook for 7\u20138 minutes until it just begins to soften. Add the minced herbs and toss to coat. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper. Pour the celery mixture over the bread and toss gently to distribute the celery evenly.\n\n## Prepare the liquid:\n\n* Combine the vegetable stock and eggs in a bowl and whisk until completely combined. Pour over the bread.\n\n## Bake the stuffing:\n\n* Scatter the remaining caramelized onions on top of the stuffing. Cover with foil and transfer to the oven for 35 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking an additional 10 minutes until the middle has set and the top is golden brown. Remove the stuffing from the oven and turn on the broiler.\n\n## Prepare the miso butter:\n\n* Combine the melted butter and miso in a bowl and whisk until smooth. Pour the mixture over the stuffing.\n\n## Broil the stuffing:\n\n* Transfer the stuffing to the oven under the broiler for 2\u20133 minutes. Keep an eye on it so that it doesn\u2019t burn, but the butter should cause the bread to crisp up and turn deep golden brown. Remove from the oven.\n\n## To serve:\n\n* Serve the stuffing warm. Keep leftovers in an airtight container for 3\u20134 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer for up to a month.

Chop the parsley and, in a big enough bowl, mix with the crumbled cheese\/feta. In addition, you can add a beaten egg (optional), which mostly acts as a binding agent\n2. Before you start rolling your Boreks, keep a small bowl of water close by, which will help so seal your pastry. Grab a triangle, place it in front of you, the short side facing towards you and the tip of the long sides away from you. And spread a tablespoon of your cheese filling along the short side. Leave around half an inch, or 1-2 cm, border right and left, which you fold, before you start rolling your cigar. Apply a enough pressure to keep the folded corners of the pastry sheets in when rolling, but don't be too firm, otherwise, you will squeeze out the cheese filling\n3. To seal your cigar b\u00f6rek, just dip the tip of the sheet in water, finish the rolling process and the sheet will stick to itself. Proceed and roll as many Cigara B\u00f6reks as possible (10-20, depending on the triangles' size and how much filling you grant one Borek)\n4. Pour the vegetable oil in a pan and heat it up over medium high till its temperature reaches 350\u00b0F or 180\u00b0C. Keep a second plate, covered with kitchen towel, ready, on which you'll drain your fried rolls\n5. Fry rolls till they turn strongly golden, almost brown. Don't overcrowd the pan and leave a little space between them. Which you should turn upside down a few times and remove from the oil in time, before they darken too much. It took us only 1-3 minutes in total per roll\n6. Shortly drain on kitchen towel, before being piled up on your serving plate\n7. Enjoy!",

Layer a muslin cloth on a colander and drop the thick yogurt on it. Bring the edges of the cloth and squeeze out the excess water. Tie the cloth around the yogurt and leaves it in fridge overnight to drain out more water.\n2. Next day, when you are ready to prepare the Dahi Kebabs, start by finely chop the cilantro and mint together.\n3. In a skillet, add the ghee and toast the cashew for 1 minute. Transfer the cashew to a chopping board and when it has cool down enough to handle, finely chop the cashew. Don't use a blender as it will turn into a paste. You want it to be finely chopped.\n4. In a mixing bowl, add the hung yogurt, chopped herbs, chopped cashew, all the spices mentioned, rice flour, salt, sugar and 1\/4 cup bread crumbs.\n5. Crush the fried onion with your hand and add that too.\n6. Now mix it all together. It will feel a little sticky, but you should be able to shape the kebabs.\n7. Once you mixed everything, wet your hand and start making bite size kebabs\/patties.\n8. Scatter 1\/4 cup bread crumbs on a plate to coat the kebabs before frying.\n9. Place a heavy bottom skillet and medium heat and pour enough oil to shallow fry the dahi kebabs.\n10. Coat the kebabs gently all around in the bread crumbs and place it carefully on the skillet. Do not overcrowd the skillet as you fry the kebabs.\n11. The kebabs are fragile, so be carefully as you flip. Fry the kebabs for 2 to 3 minutes on each side.\n12. Enjoy the dahi kebab warm with some dip of your choice, or pair with salad to make it a complete meal.",

        "recipe_comment":"The best time of the year is just around the corner and the first fruit of the fungi can be found almost everywhere. The high humidity and cold temperatures of this season work in favour of mycelium, bringing us a vast variety of delicious mushrooms. On my short staycation in Lake District, I found a few beautiful Porcini mushrooms that you can see in the picture as well as multiple Larch Boletes referred to in my country as butter mushrooms. They have slimy caps and are perfect for sauces, soups or pickles. As the name suggests Larch Bolete can be found growing in symbiosis with Larch trees starting in July till November.\r  \n\r  \nThis is my family recipe for a delicious and filling mushroom soup, perfect after a fungi hunt. It contains pasta and a variety of vegetables that elevate the mushroom flavour. The recipe works with Boletus mushrooms but if not available you can prepare them with chestnut mushrooms instead.\r  \n\r  \nIn Poland, mushroom picking is very popular among families and the knowledge is passed from generation to generation. Make sure to always pick mushrooms with someone who knows what they doing, or pick specimens that are hard to confuse, I always recommend signing up for a foraging experience! It is great fun and you can learn something new! :)\r  \n\r  \nThis recipe makes 4 portions\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**Ingredients:**\r  \n\r  \n\\- 400g (14.1oz) of sliced Boletus mushrooms (or chestnut mushrooms)\r  \n\r  \n\\- 1 medium-size onion, diced\r  \n\r  \n\\- 4 garlic cloves, sliced\r  \n\r  \n\\- 2 medium carrots, small dice\r  \n\r  \n\\- half celery stick, small dice\r  \n\r  \n\\- 3-inch piece of leek, small dice\r  \n\r  \n\\- 1 large potato small dice\r  \n\r  \n\\- 1tbsp olive oil\r  \n\r  \n\\- 1tsp of butter\r  \n\r  \n\\- 1,5L of vegetable stock\r  \n\r  \n\\- 150g (5.3oz) of penne pasta\r  \n\r  \n\\- 100ml of double cream\r  \n\r  \n\\- 1 bay leaf\r  \n\r  \n\\- black pepper\r  \n\r  \n\\- parsley to garnish\r  \n\r  \n\\- 1tsp of yoghurt per plate mixed in before serving (optional)\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**Instructions:**\r  \n\r  \n1.In a frying pan, preheat 1tbsp of olive oil. Add diced onion and 4 sliced garlic cloves, cook on medium heat for 5 minutes or until softened. Add sliced mushrooms with 1tsp of butter and turn up the heat to medium-high, cook for another 5 minutes. Once mushrooms are done remove from the heat and set aside ready for later.\r  \n\r  \n2.In a large pot add 1,5L of vegetable stock, carrots, celery, leek, potato and bay leaf. Bring to the boil and reduce to simmer. Cook for 10 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n3.Next, add 150g of penne pasta and cook for another 10 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n4.Add fried mushrooms, onions and garlic. Continue cooking for another 5 minutes.\r  \n\r  \n5.At this point, pasta should be cooked through and mushrooms should hold the shape, if the soup seems too thick add a little bit more water.\r  \n\r  \n6.Take one ladle of soup with no solids out of the pot and mix it with 100ml of double cream. Pour the mixture back to the pot. (This prevents the cream from splitting)\r  \n\r  \n7.Check the seasoning and serve garnished with freshly cracked black pepper and chopped parsley. You can mix in 1tsp of yoghurt just before serving to increase the sourness to your liking. Enjoy!\n\nBlog post: https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/wild-mushroom-soup",

Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n## Prepare the Brussels sprouts slaw:\n\n* In a bowl whisk together the mayonnaise, lime juice, maple syrup, and chili powder until smooth. Taste and season with flaky sea salt. Add a splash or two of water to thin out the dressing. Add the Brussels sprouts and toss to coat.

This quiche is super rich and delicious, I made it recently for a brunch with friends and it was a big hit!\n\n**Ingredients**  \nCelery seed crust  \n\\- \u00bd cup unsalted butter cold and cut into small cubes  \n\\- 1 \u00bc cup all purpose flour  \n\\- 1 tsp celery seed  \n\\- 1 tsp salt  \n\\- 4-5 tbsp cold water  \nQuiche  \n\\- 4 ounces chevre  \n\\- 4 eggs  \n\\- 2 cups heavy cream  \n\\- 1 teaspoon salt  \n\\- \u00bc teaspoon sugar  \n\\- \u00bc teaspoon cayenne pepper  \n\\- 1 leek thinly sliced  \n\\- 1 pound Asparagus trimmed of tough ends  \n\\- 2 tablespoons olive oil  \n\\- 1 cup frozen peas  \n\\- Salt and pepper to taste  \n**Instructions**  \n1. Prep the pie crust at least 30 minutes in advance. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, celery seed, and salt. Add cold butter, and using a pastry blender or your fingers, cut the butter into the flour until there are only small, peas sizes pieces of butter visible in the flour. Next add cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing with your hand or a spatula after each addition, until the dough begins to stick together. Using your hands, form the dough into a flat disk. Cover with plastic wrap, and chill at least 30 minutes.  \n2. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Toss asparagus with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper. Roast until slightly fork tender, about 10-15 minutes. Once the asparagus is out of the oven, raise the temp to 425\u00b0F.  \n3. Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat in a medium skillet. Add leeks and a pinch of salt, and saut\u00e9 until softened and slightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add frozen peas, and saut\u00e9 until thawed completely, another 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.  \n4. On a floured surface, roll out the dough until it's large enough to line a 9 inch round pie pan. Line pie pan with pie dough, prick bottom with a fork several times, then crumble half of the goat cheese and spread along bottom. Next add leeks and peas and spread evenly throughout the dish. Then crumble the rest of the goat cheese. Lastly arrange asparagus on top of the fillings.  \n5. Add eggs to a mixing bowl, and beat slightly. Then add heavy cream, 1 teaspoon salt, sugar, and cayenne and whisk to combine. Pour egg mixture evenly over other ingredients in the pie dish.  \n6. Bake at 425\u00b0F for 15 minutes. Then lower the temperature to 300\u00b0F and bake 35-40 minutes, or until set with just a slight wobble in the middle.  \n7. Remove from the oven and let sit 10 minutes before slicing.",

The \"savory sweetness\" is yummie and the crispy rice an eye-catcher: give it a try!\n\n**Enjoy the recipe and** [**our video \\[ASMR\\] on Youtube!**](https:\/\/youtu.be\/dZZKylqzBcQ)\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n\\- XL basmati rice \\[ 1.5 cups \/ 300 gram\\]\n\n\\- plain yogurt \\[0.75 cups \/ 180 gram\\]\n\n\\- vegetable oil \\[1\/3 cups \/ 70 gram\\]\n\n\\- salt \\[0.5 tbsp \/ 9 gram\\]\n\n\\- 2 egg-yolk\n\n\\- saffron threads \\[0.5 tsp\\]\n\n\\- butter \\[1.5 tbsp \/ 20 gram\\]\n\n\\- dried barberries \\[1\/3 cup \/ 25 gram\\]\n\n\\- sugar \\[0.5 tsp \/ 3 gram\\]\n\nServings: 3\n\nEnergy and macronutrients per serving:\n\n726 kcal \/ 3037 kJ\n\n35 g fat, 89 g carbs, 17 g protein\n\n**INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\n1. Melt butter over medium-low, add barberries and sugar, fry for 2-3 minutes and set aside. Make sure not to burn the barberries\n2. Grind saffron: we used a mortar and pestle. A pinch of salt helps with grinding. Add 2 tablespoons of water, mix and let cool down\n3. In big enough bowl, mix yogurt, salt, oil, egg-yolks and saffron \n4. Wash rice under lukewarm water, rinse till the starch is fully washed of and the water not blurry anymore. Let drain\n5. Boil 6 cups \/ 1.5 liter of water, salt it generously to make it salty as the sea\n6. Add rice and boil for 6-8 minutes, till it's soft on the outside, but still firm inside. Usually the first rice kernels start floating, when this is the case\n7. Rinse rice over cold water, this helps to prevent the rice from sticking to each other, and drain\n8. Mix into the bowl with yogurt mix. Gently, don't break the rice kernels\n9. Pre-heat the oven to 410\u00b0F\/210\u00b0C \n10. Transfer half of the rice-yogurt mix into an oven-safe form, and sprinkle half of the barberries over\n11. Cover with remaining rice and gently press with a spatula to an even form, with no excess space between rice and form, to make it as crispy as possible\n12. Cover the top of the form with kitchen foil and bake on mid-low level for 55-90 minutes. In our electric oven it took almost 90 minutes to get the outside nicely golden, but monitor the process, your oven might differ\n13. Take out of oven, take the foil off (otherwise the steam will soften your crispy rice) and let cool for a few minutes\n14. Place a plate on top of the form and turn it upside down\n15. Sprinkle the cake with the remaining barberries\n16.

Add the pears in batches, cut-side down, and cook without moving for 2-5 minutes. The sugars may burn slightly, but you want to get a nice char. Tip the pear onto the other cut side and cook that side until it chars; an additional 2-5 minutes.\n* You don\u2019t need to cook the skin side of the pear. If your pears aren\u2019t very ripe, you\u2019ll want to cook them a little longer to allow them to soften, but very ripe pears don\u2019t need to cook long. Transfer the charred pears to a plate and sprinkle with salt.\n\n#### Cook the onion:\n\n* Add the onion to the skillet and cook for 8-10 minutes until it begins to soften\u2014season with salt and pepper. Melt the plant-based butter (if using) into the onion. Once frothy, add the harissa paste (or spices) and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n#### Simmer the chickpeas:\n\n* Pour in the vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Add the chickpeas. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until the broth has reduced slightly and the onions have softened\u2013about 15 minutes. If the liquid reduces too much, add a bit more stock or water\u2014taste and season with salt and pepper.\n* Stir in the spinach and cook for 5 minutes until wilted. Turn off the heat.\n\n#### To serve:\n\n* Ladle the chickpeas between bowls and arrange the charred pear on top. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro.

        "recipe_comment":"Super crunchy fried cauliflower bites with smooth and delicate tikka masala sauce, perfect starter or a snack that you can prepare in no time! Just grab one floret and dip it in the sauce :)\n\n### What is Tikka Masala sauce and where it comes from?\n\nThe history of this popular sauce is not 100% clear, some say it was created in India while others say it was created in the UK by Bangladeshi migrant Chefs. Whoever did it, did a good job, the sauce is one of the most popular in the world thanks to its mild and delicate flavour. In short, it is the smooth tomato-based curry sauce with the addition of **garam masala** and finished with yoghurt. The sauce is usually served with dry roasted marinated chicken or lamb (Tikka). From my experience, every Chef prepares it differently, what are your experiences with this sauce?\n\n### Ingredients for Tikka Masala sauce:\n\n* 1tbsp butter\n* 1 banana shallot, finely diced\n* 2 garlic cloves, minced\n* 1tsp of fresh ginger, minced\n* 1\/2tsp turmeric\n* 1\/2tsp ground coriander\n* 1\/2tsp **garam masala** \n* 1\/2tsp mild chilli powder (add less if using standard chilli powder)\n* 400g (0.9Pounds) of chopped tomato sauce (one tin)\n* 2tsp sugar\n* 1\/2tsp salt\n* 2,5tbsp yoghurt\n* fresh coriander to garnish\n\n### Ingredients for Crunchy Cauliflower:\n\n* medium-sized cauliflower (around 750g with leaves removed) cut into florets (cut biggest florets into half).\n* 1\/2tsp salt\n* 1\/2tsp paprika\n* 1\/2tsp turmeric\n* 1\/2tsp black pepper\n* 2 eggs\n* 100g (3.5oz) breadcrumbs\n* 0,5L (0.5quarts) vegetable oil for deep-frying (may need more if using deep-fryer) \n\n### Instructions for the Tikka Sauce:\n\n**1.** In the small saucepan melt **1tbsp of butter** and add **1 diced shallot**, sweat on medium heat for around **5 minutes**.\n\n**2.** Next, add **2 minced garlic cloves**, **1tsp of minced ginger** and cook for **1 more minute**.\n\n**3.** Add all spices, **1\/2tsp turmeric**, **1\/2tsp ground coriander**, **1\/2tsp garam masala**, **1\/2tsp mild chilli powder** and cook for another **minute**.\n\n**4.** Add **400g of chopped tomatoes**, **3tsp of sugar**, **1\/2tsp of salt** and bring to simmer. \n\n**5.** Blend with a **hand blender** until smooth then finish by mixing in **2,5tbsp of yoghurt**.\n\n**6.** Taste and adjust, there should be balanced between sweetness and sourness.\n\n# Instructions for the Cauliflower Bites:\n\n**1.** Place **cauliflower florets** in the bowl and season with **1\/2tsp of salt**, **1\/2tsp paprika**, **1\/2tsp turmeric**, **1\/2tsp black pepper**. Mix until coated.\n\n**2.** In a small bowl whisk **2 eggs**. Dip each floret in the egg, then in **breadcrumbs** and place it on the plate ready for deep-frying.\n\n**3.** To deep-fry heat **0,5L of vegetable oil** in a small saucepan or deep-fryer to the temperature of **170C (340F)**. Fry a few florets at a time for around **2-3 minutes** or until golden brown. Once ready transfer onto a tray with a kitchen towel to remove excess fat, serve with sauce once all the florets are fried.

        "recipe_comment":"These golden-brown pasties taste luscious!\n\nSuper fluffy and sweet bun with a savoury mouthwatering stuffing. By the time you finish the first one, you will be thinking about another one!\n\n**What are Kapu\u015bniaczki?**\n\nThis Polish pasty is prepared for special occasions like Christmas and throughout the year as a snack. Different types of dough are used ranging from crunchy to more fluffy.\n\nOn many occasions, puff pastry is used as well for the convenience of preparation. Wild mushrooms are also used as an addition to the filling giving it more depth and richness. Exceptionally good when served with borscht. In some regions of Poland also called ''Paszteciki''\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThis recipe makes 10 pasties\n\n**Ingredients for the filling:**\n\n* 700g (1.54pounds) of Sauerkraut\n* 500ml (o.53quarts) of hot water\n* 300g (0.66pounds) of brown mushrooms, cut in half and sliced\n* 300g of red onions (3 medium-sized) finely sliced\n* 2tbsp of oil\n* 1tsp of butter\n* 2 bay leaves\n* 3 allspice berries\n* salt and black pepper\n\n**Ingredients for the dough:**\n\n* 500g (1.1pounds) of plain flour\n* pinch of salt\n* 60g (2.1oz) granulated sugar\n* 60g butter\n* 130ml (0.135quarts) milk\n* 40ml (3tbsp) water\n* 30g (1oz) fresh yeast or 15g (0.5oz) of active dry yeast\n* 2 eggs (plus 1more for brushing)\n* 2tsp of caraway seeds for topping\n\n**Recipe logistics:**\n\nIn this recipe sauerkraut needs to be boiled first, in the meantime, you can prepare the dough as it needs time to prove. Once that is done get going with the second part of the filling. Once the dough is ready, roll it, score it, place the filling inside, wrap, brush and bake - Job done.\n\n**Instructions for the filling:**\n\n**1.** Simmer **700g of Sauerkraut** in **500ml of water** with the addition of **2 bay leaves** and **3 allspice berries** for **2,5h**, remember to cover the pot with a lid. Once cooked through, drain from the liquid, discard spices, allow to cool then chop it with a knife. (Sauerkraut will be nice and soft)\n\n**2.** While waiting for sauerkraut, get a medium-sized frying pan and heat **2tbsp of oil**. Sweat the **onions** in **medium heat** for around **5 minutes**. Next, add **mushrooms** and **turn up the heat**. Pan fry until mushrooms are cooked through and start to brown, then stir in **1tsp of butter** and season with **salt and black pepper**.\n\n**3.** Mix chopped sauerkraut with mushrooms and onions, check the seasoning. It should be slightly salty and sour with little sweetness from onions.\n\n**Instructions for the dough:**\n\n**1.** Begin by heating up **130ml of milk** with **60g of butter** in a small pan until butter is dissolved. Next, transfer this mixture to the different pan, **add 40 ml (8tsp) of cold water** to bring the temperature down. Then mix in your **fresh** **yeast** until dissolved, set aside.\n\n**2.** Mix **500g of flour** with a **pinch of salt** and **60g of sugar**, add **yeast mixture** and **2 eggs**. Mix it until combined and place in the bowl to prove (dough will be sticky, do not add any more flour). **Prove until tripled in size (1-1,5h)**.\n\n**3.** Once the dough is proved, preheat the oven to **165C (330F)** and divide the dough into 10 balls around **100g each**, roll each ball into a **16cm square (6inch)**. Then make **five 3cm cuts on the left and right side of the square**. Place **80g of the filling** in the middle and braid the dough by pulling each cut to the opposite side starting from the left to right. Brush with **egg**, dust with **caraway seeds** and bake on the tray with baking paper for around **20 minutes** (bake in batches or 2 separate trays, remember to give then some space for expansion)\n\n**4.** Remove from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack, eat while warm you can also heat them up in the microwave on the next day.

        "recipe_comment":" Parmigiana is a classic recipe done in all Italy, a great comfort food! Fried eggplants with tomato sauce, parmigiano and mozzarella: a little symphony of taste. As always if you like the recipe and want to subscribe you are welcome.\n\nNote: in my family we prefer a parmigiana not much thick so I've used a baking pan 30 x 20 cm ( like you can see by the photo and video ) but if you prefer you can take a baking pan 20 x 15 cm with this ingredients\n\nVideo Recipe [HERE](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ao1XRh4_ytc)\n\n**INGREDIENTS SERVING ABOUT 4\/5 PERSONS**\n\n* 2 kg eggplants\n* 600 gr tomato sauce\n* 250 gr diced mozzarella\n* 80 gr parmigiano or grana\n* 3 cloves of garlic\n* extra virgin olive oil\n* salt\n* black pepper\n* frying oil ( peanut oil usually )\n\n**INSTRUCTION**\n\n* Cut 2 kg eggplants in slice ( 4\/5 mm thick )\n* In a colander put a layer of sliced eggplants and put a couple of pinch of salt on the eggplants. repeat this operation until you have finished the eggplants put some weight on the eggplants ( a dish would work fine ) and let it rest for 40 minutes. This operation is done to remove the bitter taste from the eggplants\n* Wash the sliced eggplants under water and Put them on a cloth to remove the excess of water, cover with another cloth and press gently.\n* Now let's fry this sliced eggplants in peanut oil.\n* You can check if the temperature of oil is right by sticking a wooden skewer in it. If bubbles form around the skewer, it is time to add the sliced eggplants.\n* Cook the eggplants for 2\/3 minutes max ( until they change color ) turning occasionally when they are cooked put them on paper towels to absorb them from the excess oil\n* Now in a pan put a spoon of extra virgin olive oil and 3 cloves of garlic cut in half, when the garlic is well browned add 600 gr tomato sauce, salt and black pepper. Let the sauce cook for 30 minutes\n* Now take a baking pan 30 x 20 cm or 20 x 15 cm and put a couple of tablespoon of tomato sauce\n* Cover with a layer of fried eggplants, other 2\/3 tablespoon of tomato sauce, a generous sprinkling of Parmigiano and diced mozzarella.\n* Repeat this operation until you have finished the fried eggplants.\n* The last layer should be much more rich of parmigiano and mozzarella \\^\\_\\^\n* Cook in oven for 35 minutes at 180\u00b0 C. Serve until is still hot.\n\nThat's all!if you have any question feel free to ask !!",

        "recipe_comment":"Beetroot risotto with creamy goat cheese. \n\nFor the full recipe with step by step pictures: [http:\/\/meza-blog.com\/recipe\/beetroot-risotto\/](http:\/\/meza-blog.com\/recipe\/beetroot-risotto\/)\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n**Risotto:**\n\n \n\n* 2 medium beetroots\n* 170 gr rice, arborio or carnarroli\n* 140 ml water\n* 1 onion\n* 4 cloves garlic\n* 1 dl white wine\n* 0.5 liter vegetable stock, (more if needed)\n* 1 tablespoon butter, preferably room temp\n* 20 gr grated parmesan cheese\n\n**garnish:**\n\n* 50 gr fresh goat cheese\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* pinch of salt\n* 1\/2 teaspoon orange zest\n\n**METHOD:**\n\n \n\n1)Start by making the puree for your risotto. Simply place your beetroots in a baking tray, cover with aluminum foil and place inside a pre heated oven on 180\\*C.\n\n2)Bake the beetroots until fork tender (piercing a fork inside without applying any pressure). Time may vary from 45 minutes to 2 hours.\n\n3)Once fork tender, peel the skin off, dice the beets roughly and blend with a stix mixer.  \nyour beatiful beetroot puree is now ready to use!\n\nFor the garnish:\n\n1)Place your cheese, olive oil and salt into a shallow mixing bowl and blend well with a stix mixer.\n\n2)Pass the creamy mixture through a fine sieve to assure a more stable texture.\n\n3)Mix well with the orange zest and set aside for further use.\n\nFor the risotto:\n\n1)Start by preparing the rice. Take a skillet or shallow pot and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your rice.\n\n2)Stir constantly for about 2-3 minutes until the edges of the grain start becoming translucent.\n\n3)Now that we build a protective layer around the grain, pour in your water and stir frequently until all the water has evaporated.\n\n4)Transfer the rice onto a tin, and let cool.\n\n5)Once cool, your rice is ready to use. This is a neat little step worth making when cooking risotto as it helps release more of that starchy goodness later on when cooking the risotto. Par-cooked rice like this can last up to a week in a food container in your fridge and will greatly shorten your time preparing risotto.\n\n6)Now take your skillet and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle over a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your diced onions.\n\n7)Saute the onions until soft and translucent. It will probably take in between 7-10 minutes.\n\n8)Once your onions are beautifully tender, add in your finely minced garlic and stir for another minute.\n\n9)Now add in your rice and season with salt and pepper. (This is the perfect time to add salt as it will drain any extra juices which will be absorbed by the rice.)\n\n10)Stir constantly for another minute or two and proceed to pour in your wine.\n\n11)Keep stirring (from this moment on, you\u2019ll have to be stirring most of the time as more motion the rice makes, the more starch it releases, creating a creamy texture.) until all the wine has evaporated.\n\n12)Now that your wine has evaporated, add 3 tablespoons of your beetroot pure and stir until incorporated.  \n\n\n13)Now start adding your vegetable stock (hot! so it doesn\u2019t prevent the rice from continuing to cook.) a little at a time as the rice absorbs the liquid. The reason you don\u2019t pour it all at the same time is because you don\u2019t know how much liquid the rice will absorb.  \n\n\n14)When the rice is cooked al-dente\u00a0 it should still have a slightly \u201crunny to watery\u201d texture, we don\u2019t want it thick.\n\n15)Now turn off the heat and add the butter, preferably room temperature so it blends more quickly\n\n16)Once you add the butter, now is the time to really work your hand, and give the rice a good beating, stirring it vigorously until all the butter has blended with the dish.  \n\n\n17)After the butter has blended add the parmesan cheese and beat again, this time not as vigorously until the cheese has melted.",

Even for a \u201csimple\u201d dinner, my dad would have at least 3 or 4 courses, and Chinese broccoli was (and is) always in the rotation as his go-to vegetable dish for us kiddos.\n\nWe'll also be going over:\n\n* How to pick the freshest Chinese Broccoli\n* How to store gai lan at home\n* How to get the perfect, soft, crunchy texture for gai lan\n* Dietary alternatives to oyster sauce\n\nHere's the [video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zi3FB2NtLCc&amp;&amp;list=PLvd5bo3J-_kq4FcYVCOK6ZR87dCGDqrSH&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s) for a walkthrough.\n\n## THE RECIPE\n\nOverview\n\n* Prep Time: 3 min\n* Total Time: 10 min\n* Yield: 4 servings\n\nIngredients\n\n* 1 lb **chinese broccoli**\n* 8 cups **boiling water**\n* 1 tbsp **oyster sauce**\n* 1 tbsp **olive oil**\n\n# Step 1 - Guide to Gai Lan: An Overview\n\n* Here's a brief overview of what we'll be doing and how to get the perfect texture:\n* Boil an abundance of water\n* Add olive oil and salt to the water\n* Bring the water to a boil BEFORE adding the gai lan\n* Bring to a boil again, and cook the Chinese broccoli for 1 to 2 minutes\n\n# Step 2 - Wash gai lan, heat wok, boil water\n\nAs always, my dad says to thoroughly wash our veggies.\n\nWe'll turn our stove on to its highest heat and set the wok on top of it. Start boiling **water** (8 cups)\u200b - the amount doesn't have to be exact, but more is better.\n\nThe less time we spend cooking Chinese broccoli, the better. And one key way to achieve a faster cooking time is to use a larger volume of boiling water.\n\nChinese restaurants are able to cook gai lan incredibly quickly, because they use larger woks on more powerful stoves.\n\n# Step 3 - Add olive oil, salt\n\nNext, well add **olive oil** (1 tbsp) and **salt** to the water.\n\nIn my dad's words, this is almost like \"make up\" for the Chinese broccoli, and it helps the gai lan retain a fresh green color and adds a beautiful shimmer.\n\n# Step 4 - Wait for boil, add gai lan, cover\n\nIt is critical that our water starts boiling before we add the Chinese broccoli. We want to keep the cook time as short as possible.\n\nSince every piece of gai lan is uniquely shaped, if you notice that there are pieces of gai lan that have a thicker stem, we can take a knife and cut down the middle of the stem about 1-2 inches.\n\nThis helps increase the stem's cooking surface area and helps it cook faster, and also helps all of the different sized pieces of gai lan cook evenly.\n\nOnce the water is boiling, add the gai lan, and cover the wok. If they're not fully submerged, add more hot\/boiling water.\n\n# Step 5 - Bring to a boil, cook for 1-2 minutes\n\nIn total, once the wok comes to a boil again, we'll only need to cook our gai lan for 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nAs the wok starts to come to a boil, about halfway there, you can flip the gai lan.\n\nMore on why we want to cook Chinese broccoli as soon as possible:\n\n* The less time that the gai lan is sitting in the boiling water, the less nutrients it loses, and the less chlorophyll it loses.\n* It's not only healthier, but it will look more mouthwatering when we're done.\n\n# Step 6 - Uncover wok, taste\n\nOnce 1 to 2 minutes are up, uncover the wok. Cut off a piece of stem and chew on it.\n\nIf it's crunchy to your liking, you're done! If you'd prefer it to be softer, you can cook it for another 1-3 minutes.\n\n# Step 7 - Make final touches\n\nOnce you're happy with the texture, turn off the heat and transfer the gai lan to a plate.\n\nTake scissors and make 1 to 2 cuts along the stems and leaves to make the gai lan easier to eat.\n\nThen, we'll drizzle some **oyster sauce** (1 tbsp) and more olive oil to taste.\n\nCall your loved ones over - time to eat!\n\n\\-------\n\n# How to select fresh Chinese Broccoli\n\nMy parents get into a lot of detail in our video's Meal Time section, but we're looking for a few cues:\n\n* The stem should be a light, fresh color\n* The stem should easily snap in half\n* The leaves should be a deeper green\n* The flowers buds, if any, should be green (not yellow)\n\n# How to store Chinese Broccoli\n\nWhen you get home from the store, line some trays with paper towels and lay each piece across the trays for 4-5 hours.Poke a few holes in a plastic bag, loosely wrap the paper towels around the gai lan, and place them in the bag.Store the bag in a vegetable compartment if you have one.\n\n# Alternatives to Oyster Sauce\n\nIf you're vegetarian or need to stay away from gluten, we have three alternatives for you!\n\n**Vegetarian Oyster Sauce**\n\nSince oyster sauce is made out of oyster extract, here are some alternatives that have a similar taste without using the actual oyster:\n\n* Wan Ja Shan Vegetarian Mushroom Oyster Sauce\n* Lee Kum Kee Vegetarian Stir Fry Sauce\n\n**Gluten Free Oyster Sauce**\n\nWok Mei has a gluten-free oyster sauce, but it still contains oyster extract, so it's not vegetarian friendly.\n\n**Vegetarian + Gluten Free Oyster Sauce**\n\nUnfortunately, we don't know of a vendor that sells an oyster sauce that caters to both dietary restrictions, so you'll need to DIY the sauce.\n\nMix equal parts gluten free soy sauce and gluten free hoisin sauce. This isn't exactly the same as oyster sauce, but it's pretty close.\n\n\\-------\n\n# Our why\n\nI've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.\n\nThanks for reading! Hope you all love the recipe :)",

        "recipe_comment":"# [Samosa Bowls](http:\/\/grumpygarbanzo.com\/Meals\/Samosa%20Bowls\/)\n\nAnything that's called a 'filling' is usually the best part of a food. Take cookie sandwiches for example: it's all about that (accidentally vegan) cream. And donuts? The jelly. Tacos? I think you get the idea.\n\nIt's the same story with samosas. Sure, we can appreciate the crispy, deep\u2013fried goodness that normally surrounds a samosa. But are full\u2013blown home\u2013made samosas really feasible on an average weeknight? Unless you were taught by your grandma and know a wonton wrapper recipe by heart, probably not.\n\nSo, I present to you: the samosa bowl. This deconstructed samosa includes the key elements of potatoes, peas, and spices. Added chickpeas and rice boost the protein content and make the meal more filling. The lack of a fried wrapper makes the meal healthier and less dangerous; sharp, triangular foods are simply up to no good. Enjoy the flavors of a samosa from the comfort of your spoon.\n\n# What:\n\nbrown rice\n\nyellow potatoes\n\nonion\n\ngarlic\n\npea\n\nolive oil\n\ngaram masala\n\ncoriander\n\nchili powder\n\nfennel seed\n\nginger powder\n\n# How:\n\nPeel, chop, and boil potatoes until tender.\n\nHeat oil in a pan over medium. Mix in spices generously and cook until fragrant.\n\nAdd chopped onion and minced garlic, cooking until soft.\n\nStir in chickpeas.\n\nOnce chickpeas are thoroughly coated in spices, add potatoes, peas, and stir.\n\nCook until well combined.\n\nServe over rice.\n\n# What did I use and why?\n\nI used frozen peas. They're convenient and, upon returning them to the freezer, I can forget about them until the next rare occasion that I actually want to cook with peas.\n\n# [link](http:\/\/grumpygarbanzo.com\/Meals\/Samosa%20Bowls\/)",

        "recipe_comment":"This is an old favourite. My mom use to make this, it\u2019s called Acar Timun dan Nenas \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfe. Some variations include carrot, and others use more vinegar and sugar but I find this ratio of vinegar to sugar the best since it doesn\u2019t result in an overly watery Acar (pronounced Achar like Charmander). It\u2019s fantastic on a very warm day. \n\n**Ingredients** (can be amended to suit your tastes)\n\n* One cucumber. Roughly peel the cucumber so you get that lovely variation in green colour. Score lengthways with a fork. Slice lengthways once through the middle and then chop thinly. \nRealistically you can cut them up however you like but a thin slice is best imo.\n\n* Half a small pineapple, chopped. \n\n* Half a red onion (or one shallot), sliced as thinly as possible. \n\n* One red chilli, thinly sliced. Or more if you like spicy stuff.\n\n* Two tablespoons of white vinegar \n\n* Two teaspoons of white sugar \n\n* Half a teaspoon of salt \n\n**Directions**\n\nChop up ingredients. Mix in bowl thoroughly (very thoroughly) with vinegar, sugar and salt. Don\u2019t add any water, there will be quite a bit of liquid from the pineapple and cucumber. Put in fridge for a bit, 30 mins or so. Eat.\n\nSomeone asked what this normally goes with. It\u2019s usually a side to some white rice and spicy curry. The heat from the curry goes really well with the coolness of the pineapple and cucumber. Otherwise eat it from a bowl like I do.",

        "recipe_comment":"Recipe here originally: [Easy Miso Fried Rice](http:\/\/triedtrue.us\/EasyMisoFriedRice)\n\nThank you all for the positive encouragement on my last post! I'm really enjoying making videos of what I cook. I'm sharing a miso fried rice recipe that I absolutely love.\n\nA note about the rice \u2013 Ideally, you would use day old rice, but if you are craving fried rice RIGHT NOW, you can make the rice fresh. Just put it in the freezer for 15 minutes while you prep your ingredients! It will give you something close to day old rice. :)\n\nPrep Time: 20 minutes\n\nCook Time: 20 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 40 minutes\n\nServings: 5\n\nCalories: 409kcal\n\nEquipment\n\n* Large wok or wide pan\n\nIngredientsSauce:\n\n* 2 tablespoons rice cooking wine\n* 2 tablespoons soy sauce\n* 1 tablespoon white miso paste\n* 2 teaspoons sesame oil\n* 2 teaspoons sambal oolek or sriracha\n* 1 teaspoon chili oil optional\n* 4 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* 2 teaspoons ginger freshly minced\n\nFried Rice:\n\n* 3 cups cooked rice See Note\n* 2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil divided\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 1 tablespoon miso paste\n* 4 eggs beaten\n* 1 yellow onion peeled and diced\n* 8 ounces mushrooms (any variety) sliced\n* 4 cups mixed vegetables such as hakurei turnips cut into matchsticks, shredded napa cabbage, diced bell peppers, or carrots cut into matchsticks\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nGarnish (Optional)\n\n* Sesame seeds\n* Sliced scallion\n\nInstructionsPrepare the Miso Butter:\n\n* Melt the butter in the microwave. Add the miso paste and gently mash it into a paste. Set aside.\n\nPrepare the Sauce:\n\n* Combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl and whisk. Set aside.\n\nCook the Eggs:\n\n* Heat 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil in wide pan or wok over high heat. Once hot, add the eggs and half miso butter. Using a wooden spoon, break the eggs up quickly as they cook for 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. It\u2019s okay if they aren\u2019t cooked all the way through.\n\nCook the Mushrooms and Onion:\n\n* Heat the remaining neutral oil in the skillet over high heat. Add the mushrooms and onion and cook, stirring often, for 5-7 minutes until beginning to brown all over. Season lightly with salt. Remove from the pan.\n\nCook the Remaining Vegetables:\n\n* Add the remaining vegetables and cook in an even layer for 2 minutes. Stir and continue cooking for 4-5 minutes until softened but but still crisp. Return the cooked mushrooms and onions to the pan. Season very lightly with salt.\n* Add the remaining miso butter and toss to combine.\n\nAdd the Rice:\n\n* Add the cooled rice and egg to the skillet and toss gently to combine.\n\nPour in the Sauce:\n\n* Add the prepared sauce to the skillet and toss to coat. Cook for 2-3 minutes more until completely coated. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\nTo Serve:\n\n* Divide the cooked rice between bowls and garnish with sesame seeds and sliced scallion. Enjoy!\n\nNotes\n\n*Note: Ideally, you would use day old rice, but if you\u2019re pressed for time, simply transfer the freshly cooked rice to a bowl and place in the freezer for 10-15 minutes as you prepare the rest of the meal.*\n\nNutrition\n\nCalories: 409kcal | Carbohydrates: 52g | Protein: 14g | Fat: 17g | Saturated Fat: 5g | Cholesterol: 143mg | Sodium: 816mg | Potassium: 462mg | Fiber: 7g | Sugar: 2g | Vitamin A: 7724IU | Vitamin C: 18mg | Calcium: 75mg | Iron: 3mg",

For all the meatballs you will need a total of 60 gr of cheese\n* take the dough in the fridge and form balls of about 40 gr inserting in the center some cubes of the chosen cheese.\n* Close the meatball as to seal the cheese inside and work with your hands to give it a round shape.\n* Don't make the meatball too big or the cheese inside will not melt from these doses you should get about 15 meatballs\n* put every meatball in the breadcrumbs\n* At this point, bring frying oil to a temperature of 140\u00b0 and immerse the meatballs in oil for a couple of minutes, so that the cheese inside melts\n* When they are golden brown, drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil\n\nThat's all! Like i said this recipe is very easy and remember : Eat while it's still hot!\n\nIf you have any question feel free to ask \\^\\_\\^",

Add the mushrooms and cook for 8-12 minutes, stirring often, until well-browned and softened. Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl.\n\n#### Cook the Mirepoix:\n\n* If the pot is too dry, add another drizzle of oil. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook for 5-7 minutes until just beginning to soften. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds.\n* Add the diced Roma tomatoes and the barley and cook for 1 minute, stirring regularly.

Once very hot, add the mushrooms and cook without moving for 2-3 minutes until very well browned. Flip and cook an additional 1-2 minutes until well-browned on the other side. Turn off the heat.\n* Transfer the mushrooms to a bowl with freshly minced parsley and sprinkle immediately with flaky sea salt. Toss to coat with parsley.\n\n#### To Serve:\n\n* Divide the mushroom barley stew between bowls and pile the crispy mushrooms on top. Garnish with any remaining parsley. Enjoy!\n\n### Notes\n\nI used young, small carrots which did not need to be peeled. If using larger carrots, you only need 3 carrots.
