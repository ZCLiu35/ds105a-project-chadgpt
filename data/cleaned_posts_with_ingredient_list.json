Pat the chicken tenderloins dry and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Set up your dredging station:**\n\n1. Set out three shallow dishes. To the first dish, add flour, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and a pinch of salt. To the second dish, add 2 eggs plus 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and whisk until smooth. Add panko with a pinch of salt and pepper to the third dish.\n\n**Preheat the oil:**\n\n1. Add about \u00bc inch of neutral oil to a wide pot or skillet. You only need enough oil to come up to half the thickness of a chicken tender. Turn the heat to medium-low to preheat the oil.\n\n**Dredge the chicken:**\n\n1. Dip a chicken tenderloin into the flour and shake off the excess. Next, dip it into the egg mixture and shake off the excess. Finish dredging the chicken by rolling it gently in the panko; gently press it into the tender to ensure it adheres. Transfer to a baking rack. Continue until all tenders are dredged.\n\n**Heat the sauce:**\n\n1. Simmer the remaining 1 cup of hot sauce over low heat as you fry the chicken tenders.\n\n**Fry the chicken tenders:**\n\n1. Turn the heat on the oil to medium. If you drop a piece of panko into the pot, it should bubble and sizzle but not overly vigorously. You can use a meat thermometer to ensure it is 350\u00baF.\n2. Once the oil is hot, fry the chicken tenders in batches, about 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown. Once the tenders reach 165\u00baF, transfer them to a cooling rack or paper towel-lined plate.\n\n**Sauce the tenders:**\n\n1. Once all the chicken tenders are fried, pour the warm sauce into a large bowl.\n2. Add the chicken tenders to the bowl in batches and toss gently to coat in the sauce.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Transfer the sauced tenders to a serving platter and sprinkle with minced scallions. Enjoy!",

Place the porcini mushrooms in a bowl. Pour 1 cup boiling water over the mushrooms and soak for 20 minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the water and finely chop them. Reserve the soaking liquid for the risotto.\n\n**Fry the cremini mushrooms:**\n\n1. Place a large pot on the stove and turn the heat to medium. Add the sliced cremini mushrooms to the dry pot and cook, turning occasionally, for 8\u201310 minutes. The mushrooms will release water and begin to dry out.\n2. Once all the liquid evaporates from the pot, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook for 8\u201310 minutes more, turning regularly, until browned and crisp. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Cook the leek:**\n\n1. Add the leek and chopped porcini mushrooms to the pot. Cook, turning occasionally, for 5 minutes until the leek softens.\n\n**Toast the rice:**\n\n1. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot. Add the rice and cook for 2\u20133 minutes until it begins to toast. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Begin adding liquid:**\n\n1. Add the porcini soaking liquid and stir to incorporate and lift anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring periodically until the rice absorbs all the liquid.\n2. Add warm water or vegetable stock in ladleful increments, stirring after each addition and adding more liquid once the rice absorbs what\u2019s in the pot. Stir occasionally, but not constantly. You may need to adjust the heat between medium and medium-low to prevent the risotto from sticking.\n3. After 20\u201325 minutes, the rice should be tender and the liquid creamy. You may need 4\u20135 cups of liquid, give or take. Taste and add more salt and pepper.\n\n**Finish the risotto:**\n\n1. Turn the heat to low. Add the Taleggio cheese and stir to incorporate. Continue stirring until the cheese melts completely. Add the Parmesan cheese, minced parsley, and lemon juice. Simmer for 2\u20133 minutes. Turn off the heat. Taste and season, and let the risotto stand for 5 minutes.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the risotto into a large serving bowl. Garnish with sweet pea tendrils and a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese if you like. Enjoy!",

Place the turkey carcass in a large stockpot and cover with 12 cups water. You may need more depending on the size of the carcass. Try your best to immerse the bird with water, but if your pot isn\u2019t big enough, it\u2019s ok if the back bone sticks out a bit. Add a big pinch of salt to the water.\n2. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 2-3 hours. You may wish to flip the bird once during simmering. The liquid should reduce by almost half.\n3. Cover the pot (with foil, if the turkey is sticking out) and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.\n4. The next day, remove the carcass from the stock. Pick off any remaining meat and set it aside in a bowl to be added to the soup. Discard the carcass.\n5. If the stock is very gelatinous, place it on the heat over medium-high just until the gelatin melts, and the stock returns to a liquid. Turn off the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve.\n6. Give the pot a quick rinse and wipe it out. Return it to the stovetop.\n\n**Cook the soup aromatics:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for 8-10 minutes.\n2. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the bundle of thyme.\n\n**Simmer the soup:**\n\n1. Pour in the prepared stock and the chopped turkey. Add salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove and discard the thyme.\n\n**Finish the soup:**\n\n1. Return the soup to a boil. Add the pastina and cook for 3-4 minutes. Taste and add salt and pepper.\n2. Finish the soup by adding parsley, fennel fronds, and lemon juice.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with lemon wedges and minced parsley on the side. Enjoy!",

Cut the beef into slices. Sprinkle with baking soda, stir and leave for 15-20 minutes.\r\n2. Slice the carrots, bell pepper and cucumber. Do not stir. Slice the onion feathers. Finely chop the chili peppers. Set aside.\r\n3. In a little oil, fry the carrots for 1 to 1.5 minute over high heat. Then similarly fry the bell pepper.\r\n4. Rinse the beef several times in cold water. Transfer to a paper towel and remove excess water.\r\n5. Heat a skillet well over a heat just below high. Add vegetable oil. Place the meat and do not stir until it has set. After that you can stir. Cook for 5-7 minutes.\r\n6. For the dressing, mix together: scallion, chili pepper, garlic, sesame seeds, sesame oil and paprika. Pour in the boiling vegetable oil. Then add soy sauce, rice vinegar, salt and sugar.\r\n7. Cook the glass noodles according to the recipe on the package. In my case, pour boiling water over it and leave it for 5-7 minutes. Afterward, drain the water.\r\n8. Transfer the glass noodles to a salad bowl. If desired, cut with scissors. Add the roasted carrots and bell pepper, cucumber, beef and pour the dressing over them. Mix well.\n\nThis salad took me about 25 minutes to make. It's best to eat it right away because it tastes better when it's warm. It will keep in the refrigerator for about 2-3 days.",

While I\u2019ve received many lessons on how to stew chicken throughout my life, none of them came with amounts.\n\nHowever I\u2019m going to break the cycle here and offer a recipe you can depend on to create an amazing pot of stew chicken.\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 1 whole chicken *(cleaned and cut into bite size pieces)*\n* 12 pimentos peppers *(seasoning peppers)*\n* 12 cloves garlic\n* 6 bundles chadon beni *(culantro\/sawtooth coriander)*\n* 1\/4 cup brown sugar\n* 1 tbsp tomato paste\n* 2 tbsp roucou *(annatto extract) or 1 tsp annatto powder*\n* 1 bay leaf\n* A few dashes of Angostura Aromatic Bitters\n* 1 cup coconut milk\n* 2 tbsp vegetable oil\n* salt &amp; black pepper *(to taste)*\n\n**Making The Green Seasoning**\n\n1. Place shadon beni, garlic and pimento into a food processor then grind until a smooth paste is formed\n\n**Seasoning The Chicken**\n\n1. Place chicken in a bowl then add 3 to 4 tbsp of green seasoning.\n2. Add 4 to 5 liberal dashes of Angostura Aromatic Bitters.\n3. Season with salt &amp; black pepper to taste.\n4. Marinate for at least one hour. For best results, marinate overnight.\n\n**Stewing The Chicken**\n\n1. Allow the seasoning chicken to thaw to room temperature.\n2. Add oil to a pot then add brown sugar.\n3. Allow the sugar to start to melt then start stirring the oil and sugar to incorporate air into the mixture using a wooden or silicon spoon.\n4. Continue to stir until the brown sugar mixture gets frothy then turns from light brown to dark brown.\n5. Add seasoned chicken to the pot then toss to ensure each piece of chicken gets coated with the caramelized sugar.\n6. Once all pieces are coated, cover and allow to cook for 5 to 8 minutes on medium\/low heat.\n7. Add 4 to 5 dashes of Angostura Aromatic Bitters to the pot.\n8. Add roucou, bayleaf, tomato paste and coconut milk to the pot.\n9. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.\n10. Reduce heat to low then cover chicken and allow to cook for 10 to 12 minutes.\n11. Serve and enjoy!\n\nYou can view a detailed breakdown of how to achieve the perfect stew [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/2ibWUOlG8VE?si=hc297YNy84Uu5mfz)",

Place the chicken in a large pot and cover with water. Add the salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour.\n2. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl. Turn the heat on the broth to medium and low boil for 20 minutes or until the liquid reduces to about 8 cups. Strain the broth through a sieve into a large bowl. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.\n3. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bird and shred or dice it into bite-sized pieces. Reserve the skin for another use (like snacking on it or frying it up for a crispy garnish) and reserve the carcass for stock if you like.\n\n**Start the soup:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook for 8\u201310 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\n2. Add the garlic powder, thyme, and crushed red pepper flakes and cook for 1 minute.\n3. Add the sun-dried tomatoes along with a teaspoon or two of the tomato oil from the jar. Cook for 1 minute more.\n\n**Simmer the soup:**\n\n1. Pour in the broth and add the shredded chicken. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings.\n\n**Cook the pasta:**\n\n1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add the ditalini and cook for 1-2 minutes under al dente. Drain.\n\n**Finish the soup:**\n\n1. Taste the soup once more. Stir in the cooked ditalini, heavy cream, and baby spinach. Simmer for 5 minutes. Add the lemon juice and season a final time. Turn off the heat. Note: You can also serve and store ditalini separately from the soup if you're averse to pasta swelling the next day.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with freshly grated Parmesan and a few basil leaves. Finish with freshly cracked black pepper, if you like. Enjoy!",

Pat the beef dry and season with salt and pepper.\n2. In a large, wide pot, heat the oil over medium-high until hot. Add the short ribs in an even layer and cook without moving for 3 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 2-3 minutes per side until browned all over. Remove from the pot. Turn the heat to medium.\n3. Add the garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and, using the back of your spoon, gently press the paste into any browned bits left in the bottom of the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes until the paste deepens in color.\n4. Pour in the red wine and lift up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the beef stock. Bring to a boil. Add the beef short ribs back to the pot and reduce heat to a low simmer. Simmer, covered, for 3 hours. Taste and season.\n5. Remove and discard the garlic cloves. Skim off as much fat from the top as you can. If you can refrigerate the short ribs overnight, you can remove the fat the next day before proceeding with the recipe. If you don't want to wait, just skim off what you can while it's still warm and proceed with the recipe as-is.\n\n**Finish the sauce:**\n\n1. Remove the ribs from the broth and bring the broth to a rapid simmer over medium-low. Cook for 25 minutes until the broth reduces by half and thickens. Mount the cold butter into the sauce, whisking to incorporate until glossy. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n2. Using your fork, tear the ribs into large pieces. Add them back to the sauce and toss to coat.\n\n**Prepare the mashed potatoes:**\n\n1. Peel and quarter the potatoes. Cover with salted water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 20-25 minutes until fork-tender.\n2. Drain the potatoes and return them to the warm pot. Allow any residual water to evaporate for 5 minutes. You can turn the heat to low to speed up this process.\n3. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl with the butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and heavy cream. Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes until they reach your desired consistency. Add the chives, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and paprika, and mash to incorporate. If the potatoes seem dry, add a few more splashes of heavy cream.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the potatoes between plates. Add a few pieces of the beef on top and drizzle the sauce all over.

Place the chicken in a large pot and cover with water. Add the onion and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Remove foam and scum as it floats to the top of the broth while the chicken cooks.\n2. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl. Return the broth to a low boil over medium heat. Simmer for 10\u201315 minutes or until the broth reduces and darkens a bit in color. You should be left with about 5\u20136 cups of broth.\n3. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and discard the spent onion. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stovetop.\n\n**Prepare the chicken:**\n\n1. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, carefully pick the meat from the bones and shred it with two forks or your fingers.\n2. Discard the bones and skin. You can also dice the cooked skin and air-fry or pan-fry it to make a crunchy garnish for the soup if you like.\n\n**Cook the mushrooms:**\n\n1. Turn the heat on the pot to medium. Add the mushrooms and cook, turning occasionally, for 8\u201310 minutes. The mushrooms will release water, and that water will evaporate.\n2. Once the water evaporates and the mushrooms begin to \u201csqueak\u201d in the pot, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and cook for 2 minutes until golden brown. Season with a pinch of salt.\n\n**Saut\u00e9 the aromatics:**\n\n1. Add the onion, celery, and carrots to the mushrooms and cook for 5\u20137 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, thyme, paprika, and crushed red pepper to taste. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n**Simmer the soup:**\n\n1. Deglaze the pot with 1 cup of white wine or water. Stir well to lift up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil for 5 minutes.\n2. Pour in the prepared broth and bring to a boil. Stir in the chicken. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Cook the rice:**\n\n1. Return the soup to a boil. Stir in the rice and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20 minutes or until the rice is tender. Add another cup or two of water if the rice absorbs too much liquid.

Thoroughly rinse the white and green parts of the leeks. Bundle the green parts together and tie them together with kitchen twine. Set aside. Halve the white parts of the leeks lengthwise and thinly slice.\n\n**Make the broth:**\n\n1. Place the chicken in a large pot and cover with 8\u201310 cups water. Add the bundled green parts of the leeks and the garlic. Season liberally with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour. Skim off any foam or scum that floats to the top of the broth.\n2. Remove and discard the bundled leeks. Transfer the chicken to a large bowl. Transfer the head of garlic to a small bowl.\n3. Return the broth to a low boil and cook for 20 minutes to reduce the liquid to about 6 cups. Taste the broth and add more salt if you like. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl and wipe out the pot.\n\n**Prepare the chicken and garlic:**\n\n1. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones and shred it with your hands or dice it into small pieces, depending on your preference. Carefully pop the garlic from the paper and mash it into a paste with a fork.\n\n**Make the soup:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in the pot. Add the shallots, carrots, celery, white parts of the leeks, and potatoes. Cook for 8\u201310 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\n2. Add the garlic paste and chicken. Cook for 1 minute.\n3. Pour in the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the farro, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes until the farro is tender and the potatoes are fork-tender. Taste and add salt and pepper if needed.\n\n**Finish the soup:**\n\n1. Stir in the dill and lemon juice and simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with more dill. Serve with lemon wedges if you like. Enjoy!",

Season it with salt and white pepper as well as some corn starch, and optionally top with XO sauce for some extra savoury flavour.\n* Broccoli: 1 small head  \nAlso approximately the same volume as the rice.

Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and leeks and cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften about 6\u20137 minutes.\n2. Add the celery and fennel and cook for an additional 5 minutes\u2014season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Bloom the spices:**\n\n1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the thyme, paprika, and garlic powder\u2014Cook for 45 seconds.\n\n**Prepare the roux:**\n\n1. Sprinkle the flour over the aromatics. Cook, stirring regularly, for 3\u20134 minutes.\n2. Slowly whisk in the water or stock in 1-cup increments. Whisk after each addition until smooth. Turn the heat to medium-high. Continue adding the liquid and whisking until all the liquid has been incorporated. Taste and season generously with salt and pepper.\n\n**Cook the potatoes:**\n\n1. Once the liquid is bubbly and simmering rapidly, add the potatoes. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 30 minutes until the potatoes are fork-tender.

Pour the extra virgin olive oil into a small saucepan and turn the heat to medium. Once the oil is hot, add the sage. The oil should bubble as soon as the sage is added. Next, turn the heat to low and allow the oil and sage to bubble lightly over low heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes more. Be careful not to burn the sage!\n2. Turn off the heat and add a sprinkle of salt. Set aside.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Once the potatoes are fork-tender, turn off the heat.

Place the milk, cream, half the sugar, vanilla pod &amp; salt into a medium sized saucepan. Set over a low heat &amp; warm until steaming (don't boil!).\n2. In the meantime, add the egg yolks, remaining sugar, milk powder &amp; cornflour into a heatproof mixing bowl &amp; whisk to combine.\n3. Pour a third of the warm milk into the yolks &amp; whisk them together.\n4.  Pour the tempered yolks into the pan of remaining milk &amp; cook over a low heat until thickened &amp; has reached a temperature of 82\u00b0c. Make sure to stir the custard constantly with a rubber spatula to stop it from catching. 5. Pass the custard into a jug, through a sieve then serve immediately.\n\n**Toffee Sauce**\n\n1. Place the cream, sugar, butter &amp; golden syrup into a medium sized saucepan then place over a low heat.\n2. Cook until the butter has melted &amp; the sugar has dissolved then increase the heat &amp; bring to the boil. Cook for 2-3 minutes then remove from the heat &amp; stir in the vanilla &amp; salt. Set aside &amp; leave to cool. 2. Next, grease the pudding moulds with softened butter then add a tablespoon of toffee sauce into the bottom of each one. Set aside in the fridge until ready to use.\n\n**The Sponge**\n\n1. Preheat an oven to 170\u00b0c\/150\u00b0c fan (340\u00b0f\/300\u00b0f fan).\n2. Chop the dates into small pieces &amp; place into a bowl with the bicarbonate of soda &amp; boiling water. Leave to soak for 10-15 minutes then blitz with a stick blender\/food processor until smooth.\n3. In the meantime, sift together the flour, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon &amp; salt. Set aside.\n4. Place the softened butter &amp; sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer then use the paddle attachment to beat until light &amp; fluffy. This will take at least 5 minutes on a medium speed.\n5. Next, mix in the egg, followed by the black treacle.\n6. Add in half of the flour &amp; half of the date puree &amp; mix until just combined.\n7. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula then add in the remaining flour, dates &amp; the sour cream. Mix until just combined.\n8. Transfer the cake batter into a large jug then pour an equal amount into each mould.\n9. Place the moulds onto a baking tray then bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes. A skewer inserted into the centre should come out clean.\n10. Once cooked, leave to cool for 5 minutes then use a sharp, serrated knife to trim each sponge level to the top of the mould.\n11. Tip each sponge out onto a plate then pour over some hot toffee sauce.\n\n**To warm up the sauce, heat on high in a microwave until bubbling or warm in a saucepan over a medium heat.**",

Browning the Meat:** In a large skillet over high heat, add 2 tbsp of the olive oil. Once hot, add the chicken, lamb pieces, and chorizo slices. Brown them on all sides (you might need to do this in few batches). Transfer the browned meat to the slow cooker.\n\n**2. Saut\u00e9ing the Vegetables:** In the same skillet, add the remaining olive oil. Saut\u00e9 the onions until translucent. Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for another minute. Transfer the onion and garlic mixture to the slow cooker.\n\n**3. Slow Cooker Layering:** On top of the meat and onions in the slow cooker, add the sliced red and green bell peppers, chopped tomatoes, and bay leaves. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika.\n\n**4. Deglazing the Skillet:** Pour the white wine into the skillet and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour this mixture into the slow cooker.\n\n**5. Cooking:** Add stock, the vegetables will release moisture as they cook. Cover and cook on the low setting for 6-8 hours or high setting for 3-4 hours (or until the meats are tender and flavours melded).\n\n**6. Final Adjustments:** Once done, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. If you desire a thicker sauce, you can thicken it with cornflour mixed with water.\n\n**7. Serving:** Serve the Chilindr\u00f3n with rice, potatoes, or crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce. Garnish with pickled chilli's for extra kick, enjoy your slow-cooked Chilindr\u00f3n!\n\nOriginally posted: [Authentic Spanish Chilindr\u00f3n Recipe](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/authentic-slow-cooker-chilindr%C3%B3n-spanish-lamb-chicken-and-chorizo-stew-recipe)",

Preheat oven to 425F. Roast potatoes in 1 tbsp butter and 1tbsp olive oil, \u00bd tsp salt, and 1 tsp thyme for about 25 minutes, stirring as needed. Reserve. Then roast the celery root in 1 tbsp olive oil, \u00bd tsp salt, and 1tsp thyme for 20-25 minutes. Add the roasted celery root to the reserved potatoes.\n\n2. While the celery root is roasting, melt 2 tbsp butter in a large stock pot, then the chopped onion with \u00bd tsp salt. Saut\u00e9 for 10 minutes, then add the chopped carrots and saut\u00e9 10 minutes more. \n\n3. Add the garlic cloves with the tomato and pepper paste, stir to fully incorporate and cook 2 minutes. Then mix in the reserved roasted vegetables with \u00bd tsp salt, \u00bd tsp pepper, 1 tbsp thyme, 2 tbsp vadouvan, and 1 tbsp butter. Toss in the bay leaf and pour in the corn and seafood stocks. Stir and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. \n\n4. Cover the pot and gently simmer for 45 minutes. Turn off the heat, **remove** and reserve the bay leaf. Blend the ingredients completely with an immersion blender. Taste. Return the bay leaf to the pot if desired, and heat the blended soup over low heat. When starting to simmer, add the corn, juice of \u00bd lemon, and \u00bd tsp salt to the pot, and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat, stir in the heavy cream and \u00bd tsp black pepper. \n\n**To serve:** add desired amount of lump crab to your serving bowl(s). Sprinkle with sea salt, black pepper, and juice of 1 lemon wedge, and toss. Ladle soup into the bowls and top with additional black pepper and scallions. I served with sourdough baguette slices and a simple mixed greens salad with a quick lemon-olive oil dressing.",

You can omit it and use just gochujang and kimchi instead.\n\nI didn't have fresh kimchi, but I had dehydrated so that's what I used in the broth. If you have fresh kimchi, feel free to chop it up and throw it in instead of dehydrated.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 pound firm tofu\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced\n* 1 shallot, peeled and diced\n* \u00bc cup gochujang\n* 1 tablespoon vegan kimchi paste, optional\n* 6 cups water or vegetable broth\n* 1 tablespoon dehydrated kimchi or \u00bc cup fresh kimchi, chopped\n* 3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce more or less to taste\n* 3 teaspoons sesame oil, divided\n* 8.4 ounces ramen noodles or use 4 blocks of instant ramen noodles\n* 14.5- ounce can full-fat coconut milk\n* 5 scallions, thinly sliced; white and green parts kept separate\n* 1 cup frozen edamame\n* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds\n* Salt to taste\n\n**Press the tofu:**\n\n1. Drain the tofu and wrap it with paper towels. Place on a plate with a heavy-bottomed pan on top. Set aside for 15\u201320 minutes. Cut into bite-sized cubes.\n\n**Cook the mushrooms and shallot:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot. Add the mushrooms and cook, turning occasionally, for 8\u201310 minutes. Add the shallot and cook for 2\u20133 minutes until soft. Add a pinch of salt.\n\n**Fry the gochujang and kimchi paste:**\n\n1. Add the gochujang and kimchi paste to the pot. Cook for 1\u20132 minutes until it begins to deepen in color.\n\n**Simmer the broth:**\n\n1. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil. Add the kimchi, 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce if needed. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasonings.\n\n**Cook the noodles and tofu:**\n\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the ramen noodles according to package",

Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with water. Add a liberal pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are fork-tender. Scoop out \u00bd cup of the cooking water and set it aside. Drain the potatoes.\n2. Combine the ricotta, Parmesan cheese, chives, garlic powder, white pepper, and 2 tablespoons butter in a large bowl. Add \u00bc cup of the potato cooking water and whisk until combined. The butter does not need to be completely melted. \n3. Add the cooked potatoes and use a masher to mash until mostly smooth. Taste and add salt and pepper. Add more of the potato cooking water or a splash of heavy cream as needed and continue mashing until the potatoes reach your desired consistency. Cover the bowl with foil and keep the potatoes warm.\n\n**Cook the pancetta:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400\u00baF.\n2. Add the pancetta to a large, cold oven-proof wide pot and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook for 6\u20138 minutes, stirring frequently, until the pancetta is very crispy. Remove the pancetta from the pot using a slotted spoon, leaving the fat in the pan.\n\n**Caramelize the shallots:**\n\n1. In the same pot over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Once hot and shimmering, add the shallots, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes until the shallots begin to brown. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of sugar on top and continue cooking over low to medium-low heat (adjust the heat periodically as they cook) for 10 minutes more until evenly browned. Shallots burn very easily, so keep an eye on them!\n2. Remove the shallots from the pot and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate. Season to taste with a sprinkle of salt. Carefully wipe out the skillet.\n\n**Cook the pork tenderloin:**\n\n1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the pot over medium-high. Once hot, add the pork tenderloin and cook for 3\u20134 minutes per side until the entire tenderloin is well-seared.\n2. Transfer the pot to the oven and cook for an additional 15\u201318 minutes or until the pork reaches 135\u00baF at the thickest part. Remove the pot from the oven, transfer the tenderloin to a cutting board, and rest for 10 minutes. After the pork has rested, thinly slice and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm.\n\n**Make the spinach:**\n\n1. Return the pot used for the pork tenderloin to the stove over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Once melted and bubbly, add the minced garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n2. Pour in the chicken broth and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.\n3. Add the spinach and cook for 2\u20134 minutes, stirring regularly, until the spinach wilts. Add the lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and black pepper. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving platter and top with the spinach and a few spoonfuls of the pan sauce. Arrange the sliced pork tenderloin on top. Garnish with the crispy pancetta, browned shallots, and minced parsley. Spoon the remaining pan sauce on top of the pork. Enjoy!",

Preheat oven to 425 F\n2. Prepare Squash: Toss cubed squash with 1 Tbsp Walnut Oil, 2 tsp salt, ground pepper, and half the chopped sage. Spread evenly on a baking sheet.\n3. Place baking sheet in the oven and cook until squash begins to brown and becomes tender and delicious looking, about 20 minutes.\n4. While the squash is cooking, toss the chopped apples in the remainder of the Walnut Oil and Sage (I add a dash of salt and pepper too).\n5.  Add the diced apples onto the sheet pan, and stir to combine everything evenly. Place in oven for another 10 minutes.\n6. During this cook time, immersion blend or stir together the Maple Syrup, Brown Mustard, and Apple Cider Vinegar. \n7. At this point the apples should still have some firmness, and the squash should be very tender. Take the Maple Syrup and Mustard mixture and drizzle it over the apples and squash. Place back in the oven and cook for 5 more minutes.\n8. Remove from oven and plate! I garnished mine with some fresh Nasturtiums from the garden, but any fresh addition on top would be nice. Tarragon or Chives would be lovely! I've also garnished with sumac or cinnamon in other variations. I hope you enjoy it!",

Add the rice and cook for 1\u20132 minutes. Season with salt and pour in the water. Bring to a boil.\n2. Reduce heat to low and stir once. Crush the saffron between your fingers and sprinkle on top of the rice. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let stand for 10 minutes. Remove the cover and fluff with a fork.\n\n**Make the salad dressing:**\n\n1. Place the Greek yogurt, lemon juice, and parsley in a food processor. Pulse until smooth. Add the olive oil and blend until combined. Taste and add salt. Add a few splashes of water until the dressing reaches a drizzling consistency. Set aside.\n2. Combine the Romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, shredded carrots, and avocado in a large bowl. Toss to combine. Pour the dressing on top and toss gently to coat evenly. Add salt and pepper, if needed.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the rice onto a serving platter. Pile the chicken thighs and vegetables on top. Garnish with minced parsley or mint leaves. Serve with Aleppo pepper, sumac, or dukkah on top if you like. Serve the salad on the side, and enjoy!",

It is perfect on tomato bruschetta, salads, spaghetti with tomato sauce or to season vegetables and various pasta dishes.\n\n[Here the original link to the video ;-) If you need more help ask me](https:\/\/youtu.be\/YO-Igyb2Ijw)\n\n**RECIPE**\n\n* Fresh basil 100gr\n* EV Olive Oil 250ml\n* Salt to taste\n* Garlic to taste (I used just a little piece)\n\n**Procedure:**\n\n1. Sterilize a glass bottle in boiling water (pay attention to the capacity), let it dry well. We will use it to bottle the basil oil\n2. Whash the basil\n3. In a saucepan, boil the water and add the salt. Cook the basil for about 2 minutes\n4. Put the basil in a bowl of cold water and ice for 1-2 minutes, then dry it well with paper towels\n5. Blend the basil with oil, garlic and a little salt (3-4 minutes at maximum speed)\n6. Filter with a colander (the narrower the screen, the clearer and more intense the color of the oil will be)\n7. Store for 4-5 weeks max in a cool place away from light\n\nPAY attention: I keep My basil oil 3 months and more, the last month I keep it in the refrigerator, but being homemade it is better to use a lot of precaution to prevent botox and bacteria, so point 7 I suggested you to keep it only for few weeks.",

Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Turn off the heat and add the mushrooms. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and dice them.\n\n**Prepare the vegetables:**\n\n1. Dice all of the vegetables needed for the fried rice. Place the baby bella mushrooms in one bowl and combine the white parts of the scallions, the yellow onion, bell pepper, and carrots in a bowl.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. Combine soy sauce, sesame oil, 2 tablespoons mushroom soaking water, minced ginger, white pepper, and crushed red pepper in a bowl and whisk to combine. Set aside.\n\n**Make the fried rice:**\n\n1. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sliced baby bella mushrooms and cook, turning occasionally, for 8\u201310 minutes until golden brown.\n2. Add the bowl of diced vegetables (scallions, onion, pepper, and carrots) to the wok with the mushrooms and season lightly with salt. Cook, turning often, for 3\u20135 minutes until the carrots soften and the onions are translucent.\n3. Add the diced shiitake mushrooms and cook for 1 minute.\n4. Add the cooked rice to the wok and break it up with a metal spatula. Turn regularly, being careful not to mush up the rice too much. It should make good contact with the skillet or wok. Cook the rice for 5 minutes until it crisps up in spots.\n5. Make a well in the middle of the rice. Pour in the sauce, bring to a boil, and reduce the heat back to medium. Use your spatula to toss the rice in the sauce for 1\u20133 minutes until well-coated. Stir in green scallion parts and cook for 1 minute. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the fried rice between shallow bowls and serve the remaining scallion greens on top. Enjoy!\n\n**Recipe notes:**\n\n\\*If you don\u2019t have day-old rice, make 3 cups cooked rice from 1 cup dry. Rinse 1 cup of dry rice and combine with 2 cups water and a few shakes of salt in a small pot. Bring to a boil, stir once, cover, and simmer on low heat for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let stand for 5\u201310 minutes. Transfer to a sheet pan or pour into a large bowl and spread into an even layer (up the sides of the bowl if not using a sheet pan). Transfer to freezer for 15 minutes.\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nCALORIES: 285kcal | CARBOHYDRATES: 39g | PROTEIN: 7g | FAT: 12g | SATURATED FAT: 2g | SODIUM: 824mg | FIBER: 2g | SUGAR: 2g",

Place the shrimp in a large bowl and pat dry with paper towels. Season with salt, pepper, Aleppo pepper flakes, and cayenne powder. Toss to coat and refrigerate until needed.\n\n**Make the creamed corn:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the shallot and cook for 4-5 minutes until softened.\n2. Add the corn and cook for 5\u20137 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\n3. Melt the butter into the corn and add the flour, paprika, and cayenne. Cook, stirring to coat the corn in the flour, for about 1\u20132 minutes.\n4. Pour in the milk, stirring constantly as you pour, until the flour is incorporated and the sauce is smooth. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally as it cooks to prevent sticking. Add more milk as needed if the liquid evaporates too quickly.\n5. After 15 minutes, stir in the cream. Taste and season. If you like, use an immersion blender and blend half the mixture. Simmer for 5 minutes more. The sauce should be thick, and the corn should be creamy and tender.\n\n**Cook the shrimp:**\n\n1. In a large skillet, heat the neutral oil over medium-high until hot. Add the cherry tomatoes and cook for 5\u20137 minutes, turning often, until the skins split and the tomatoes begin to burst. Lightly break a few of them open with your spoon. \n2. Melt the butter into the tomatoes and season them with salt and pepper.\n3. Add the shrimp to the tomatoes and immediately spread them into an even layer.\n4. Cook for 2\u20133 minutes per side until almost opaque. The cooking time will depend on the size of the shrimp. Turn off the heat and stir in the parsley and lemon juice. Let stand in the hot skillet for a minute or two to allow the residual heat to finish cooking the shrimp.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the corn into shallow bowls and pile the shrimp on top. Spoon any sauce from the skillet over the shrimp. Garnish with more parsley and a pinch of Aleppo pepper flakes. Enjoy!",

Take a small piece and fry or microwave until cooked through. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.\n3. Form into tablespoon-sized meatballs and set aside.\n\n**Fry the meatballs:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the meatballs in an even layer, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. You may need to fry them in batches.\n\nCook, turning every 3 minutes, until well-browned all over and nearly cooked through.\n\n1. If you cooked in batches, return all the meatballs to the pot in an even layer and pour in the water or stock. Bring to a boil and then cover.

Combine the cilantro, jalape\u00f1o, and garlic in a food processor. Pulse until minced. Add the Greek yogurt, lemon juice, and water and pulse until combined. Add more water to achieve a drizzling consistency. Taste and add salt.\n2. Place the diced English cucumber in a bowl. Pour the sauce over the cucumber and toss to combine. Taste and season.\n\n**Make the salad:**\n\n1. Combine the Romaine lettuce, parsley leaves, radishes, cucumber, watercress, and halved cherry tomatoes in a large bowl and toss to combine. Add a sprinkle of salt.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon 1\u20132 tablespoons hummus into 4 shallow bowls and use the back of your spoon to smooth it out into a smear. Pile the salad on top and arrange a few slices of avocado on each salad. Pile meatballs on top of each salad and drizzle with the yogurt sauce. Garnish with dukkah and cilantro leaves, if you like.

It depends. \nBeen in South Louisiana all my life and different rouxs are preferred in different areas. \nSome people think a dark roux is the \"proper\" way but that's not true. \nTrue \"Cajun\" chicken and sausage gumbo has a light and thin roux. Almost like a soup. Most true Cajuns I know do not like dark rouxs. \nNew Orleans is where the dark roux is preferred. \nAnd then for a seafood gumbo it's dark roux all around usually. \nThe amount of time it takes you to make a roux from scratch on the stove just depends on how high your heat is.. A lot of Cajuns will sit there on a roux for an hour or more and still have a light roux. \n\nThis looks pretty decent. My only criticism would be the meat to liquid ratio is off, but that's all preference.  \nOverall nice job.",

Whisk beer, room-temperature water, and oil together in 2-cup liquid measuring cup.\n\n2. *Knead the dough:* Fit mixer with dough hook. Mix flour mixture on low speed while slowly adding beer mixture until cohesive dough starts to form and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Increase speed to medium and knead until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl, about 8 minutes.\n\n3. *Add meat and cheese:* Reduce speed to low and add provolone, prosciutto, pepperoni, capicola, and pepper. Continue to knead until combined, about 2 minutes longer (some meats and cheese may not be fully incorporated into dough at this point; this is OK). Transfer dough and any errant pieces of meats and cheese to lightly floured counter and knead by hand to evenly incorporate meats and cheese into dough, about 1 minute.\n4. *Let dough rise:* Form dough into smooth, round ball and place seam side down in lightly greased large bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let dough rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1\u00bd hours.\n5. *Separate into two pieces:* Line baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust with cornmeal. Turn out dough onto counter and gently press down to deflate any large air pockets. Cut dough into 2 even pieces. Press each piece of dough into 8 by 5-inch rectangle with long side parallel to counter's edge.\n6. *Shape and second rise:* Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, fold top edge of rectangle down to midline, pressing to seal. Fold bottom edge of rectangle up to midline and pinch to seal. Flip dough seam side down and gently roll into 12-inch loaf with tapered ends. Transfer loaf to 1 side of prepared sheet. Repeat shaping with second piece of dough and place loaf about 3 inches from first loaf on sheet. Cover with greased plastic and let rise at room temperature until puffy and dough springs back slowly when pressed lightly with your finger, about 45 minutes.\n7. *Bake:* Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Using sharp paring knife in swift, fluid motion, make \u00bd-inch-deep lengthwise slash along top of each loaf, starting and stopping about 1\u00bd inches from ends. Bake until loaves register 205 to 210 degrees, 22 to 25 minutes. Transfer loaves to wire rack and let cool completely before serving, about 3 hours. To store, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate, allowing to reach room temperature before serving again. This bread freezes excellently and can be thawed in the oven without issue.",

Add water in a pot and when it starts to boil put just a tablespoon of salt in it\n2. Remove the spiced crust and the rind from the Guanciale cutting it in strips\n3. Add the guanciale in a pan and let it brown (cook and stir for 4min - middle heat\n4. Grate 120gr of pecorino cheese (if the pecorino has a strong flavour you can use 60gr of pecorino and 60gr of Parmiggiano Reggiano\n5. Break the eggs putting in a large dish or a pan (my recipe: 2 whole eggs and 4 yolks)\n6. Beat the eggs adding a little freshly grated black pepper and the pecorino cheese. Then add a bit of hot water while you are beating\n7. Add the pasta to the guanciale and cook with high heat (2 min). The pasta should be drained when it is still a little bit hard.

Usually around three hours then I start checking. Total time really depends on the size.   \n\nIf you want to reduce the fat in the meat on the bottom of the roast then place a sturdy rack in the bottom of the pan so up an inch or so. \n\nMost of mine I have done with salt and pepper as well as a can of spicy V8 poured over it. \n\nI look forward to trying OP\u2019s rub on my next one.  It won\u2019t be as good as a lovely smoked one but expect it will still be pretty good.  Thank you OP for sharing.",

        "ingredient_comment":"Hello friends!\n\nToday, I\u2019m sharing my recipe for chicken meatballs with cream sauce. It\u2019s a delicious dish that can be prepared in a short amount of time. [Original recipe](https:\/\/grillmangal.art\/en\/chicken-meatballs-in-creamy-sauce\/)\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 700 g ground chicken\n* 50 g white bread (crumb)\n* 50 ml milk\n* 120 g onion (1 medium onion)\n* 1 tsp salt (6 g)\n* 1\/2 tsp black pepper (1.5 g)\n* 1\/2 tsp oregano\n* 50 g butter\n* 100 ml 20% cream\n* 100 ml chicken broth\n* 3-4 tbsp sunflower oil (for frying)\n\n**Cooking process**\n\n1. Finely chop the onion.\n2. Heat a frying pan, add 1 tbsp sunflower oil and put the finely chopped onion here.\n3. Fry until soft, stirring so it doesn\u2019t burn. Over medium heat.\n4. Crumble the white bread and pour in 50 ml of milk, let it stand for 5-7 minutes to soak well.\n5. Put the ground meat in a bowl where we will knead it, make a recess and put the onion there, add the bread with the milk. Instead of ground meat, you can take chicken breast and finely chop it. As I usually do.\n6. Add salt, pepper. You can also add various spices, such as turmeric, oregano, etc. I don\u2019t add them to this recipe.\n7. Mix the meat mixture thoroughly.\n8. The amount of meat and other ingredients is not just for nothing) I make meatballs of approximately 80 grams each, 12 pieces in total, and that\u2019s exactly how many fit in a 32 cm diameter frying pan.\n9. Divide the meat mixture into equal pieces, make balls out of them. Do not roll them too hard, so they don\u2019t become too dense inside.\n10. Heat the same frying pan where you fried the onion. Add all the sunflower oil, 2-3 tbsp.\n11. Add 50 g of butter to the same frying pan.\n12. As soon as the butter melts and starts sizzling, place our meatballs in the frying pan.\n13. Put them on the edges of the pan, the center will come in handy.\n14. Fry until golden brown (usually 2-3 minutes) on one side, turn over to the other. All this is done over high heat.\n15. Fry for a couple of minutes, make sure that a crust has formed on the other side as well, reduce the heat to medium.\n16. In the center of the pan, sprinkle 1\/2 teaspoon of oregano, mix, let the aroma develop.\n17. Pour 100 ml of broth into a pan, you can use ready-made broths, but you need to carefully look at their composition (how much salt, spices, etc.).\n18. Add cream.\n19. Stir the resulting sauce in the middle of the pan.\n20. Cook for another 7-8 minutes and turn off.\n21. The dish is ready.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the whole recipe!\n\nCook with pleasure!",

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon for 15\u201320 minutes until browned and cooked through. Season with salt and pepper.\n2. Transfer the cooked beef to a paper towel-lined plate and discard all but 2 teaspoons of fat in the skillet.\n\n**Cook the onion and peppers:**\n\n1. Return the skillet to the stove over medium heat. Add the onion and both diced peppers and cook until softened, about 5\u20137 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper.\n2. Add the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, cayenne powder, paprika, and turmeric. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and mash it into the skillet. Cook for 1\u20133 minutes until it deepens in color.\n3. Return the beef to the pot and toss to combine.\n\n**Simmer the hot dog sauce:**\n\n1. Pour in the beef broth and add the chili sauce. Taste and add more salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar if needed. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat and simmer for at least 30 minutes until thick.\n2. Stir the hot dog sauce occasionally as it cooks. If the liquid evaporates too quickly, add a splash or two of water.\n3. If the hot dog sauce is too thin, turn the heat up a touch and continue simmering until the liquid evaporates.\n4. Taste and season once more before serving.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Serve the hot dog sauce on top of your favorite hot dog. Be sure to warm the buns first! I like to microwave them so they\u2019re soft, but toast or grill them if you prefer. Serve with ketchup, mustard, and finely minced yellow onion on top. Enjoy!",

Preheat the oven to 175\u00baC\/350\u00baF and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\n2. Sift flour, almond flour, and salt into a mixing bowl and whisk together until combined. Set aside.\n3. In a stand mixer bowl, or in a bowl with a handheld mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.\n4. Add the egg and vanilla and mix until incorporated. \n5. Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture and mix on low, until incorporated.\n6. Roll out the dough to 10mm\/ 3\/8\u201d thickness and chill covered in the freezer for 10 minutes.\n7. Cut the dough into 2\u201d rounds and transfer to baking sheet.\n8. Bake for 13-15 minutes until lightly golden at the edges.\n9. Once finished baking, cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to finish cooling.\n\n*Marshmallow*\n\n1. Bloom the gelatin with 120ml water in a small bowl and set aside.\n2. In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, mix sugar, corn syrup with 80ml water. Set heat to med-hi.\n3. While the syrup is heating, beat the egg whites on low until foamy. Add a pinch of salt and continue beating on low.\n4. When the syrup temperature reaches 100\u00baC\/210\u00baF, increase the mixer speed to high and continue beating the whites.\n5. When the syrup reaches 118\u00baC\/245\u00ba, remove from heat and pour into the egg whites (with the mixer still going). Avoid touching the syrup to the side of the bowl. Keep beating egg whites.\n6. In the same saucepan, melt the gelatin. Once liquid, pour into the egg whites.\n7. Continue beating the egg whites until the bowl is completely cooled.\n8. Scoop the marshmallow into a piping bag fitted with a 1A piping tip (or similar round tip).\n9. Pipe the marshmallow onto the cooled biscuits by holding the piping tip over the center of the biscuit and squeezing. The marshmallow will look as if it is inflating, slowly move the tip upward to allow it to \u201cgrow.\u201d Once the marshmallow almost reaches the sides of the biscuit, lift the tip and repeat, making a smaller blob on top. \n10. Once the marshmallow has been piped, brul\u00e9e the marshmallow lightly with a torch (this is optional).   Set the biscuits aside on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet or parchment paper to allow the marshmallow to set. \n\n*Ganache\/Chocolate Shell*\n\n1. In a double boiler, melt the chocolate and the butter.\n2. Once the mixture has melted, mix in a pinch of salt.\n3. While the chocolate is still liquid, pour the chocolate over the top of each cookie, making sure all sides are covered. \n4. Once the ganache has been poured over all of the cookies, allow the chocolate to set for a couple of hours before serving.",

It's better if it's chilled\n\nDecoration:\n\n* 3 tbsp (45ml) lemon juice\n* 2 tbsp (30ml) water\n* 2 tbsp (25g) sugar\n* Thinly sliced lemon\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. In a food processor, add 4oz (120g) digestive biscuits. Crush them until they are totally crushed, or no big chunks left (0,2 inches-0,5 cm). Add 4 tbsp (60g) of melted butter, and process until totally combined. You can also do this whole process by having the biscuits in a zip bag, and crushing them with a rolling pin, and then combining it with the melted butter in a small bowl with a spoon.\n2. Add the mixture into a 8inch (20cm) spring pan or a removable bottom pan, and flatten it with a spoon or the bottom of a cup. Leave in the fridge for later.\n3. In a small bowl with cold water, add 5 sheets of gelatin. Leave for later.\n4. In a small sauce pan, add 3 tbsp (50ml) of water, 7tbsp (100ml) of lemon juice (2-3 lemons), and 1\/2 Cup (100g) of granulated sugar. Turn it on to low-medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves. Once it starts boiling, add the 5 sheets of gelatin, turn off the heat, and stir for 1min before taking of heat, and leaving it to cool down for 5mins.\n5. In a big bowl, add 12oz (350g) of Philadelphia cream cheese (room temperature), the zest of 2 lemons, and the lemon mixture from before, and whisk until combined.\n6. In another big bowl, add 12oz (350ml) of heavy cream (35% fat, and better if it's chilled), and beat until medium-stiff peaks.\n7. Add the Philadelphia mixture to the Heavy Cream mixture, and beat everything until combined. Then pour the mixture in the pan with the crust, flatten it out, and leave in fridge for at least 2 hours.\n8. For the decoration, into a bowl with cold water, add 1 gelatin sheet. Leave it for later.\n9. In a small sauce pan, add 3 tbsp (45ml) lemon juice, 2 tbsp (30ml) water, and 2 tbsp (25g) sugar. Turn it on to low-medium heat, and stir until the sugar dissolves. Add the gelatin sheet and stir for 1min. Then let the mixture cool down for 5min.\n10. After those 5mins, you can add 1 or 2 drops of yellow coloring.\n11. Pour the mixture into the Philadelphia pan. Pour it on top of the pan, on the back of table spoon, so it doesn't damage the surface of the cake. At this point you could also decorate with very thinly sliced lemon before putting it in the fridge for at least 2 hours.",

For the crust, add the oreos to a food processor and crush for around 1 minute. Add the melted butter and process until it's evenly wet. You can also crush the cookies by placing them in a zip bag and using something like a rolling pin to crush them, and then mix them with the melted butter in a bowl. \n2. Add the mix to an 8-inch (20-cm) pan and even it out with a spoon or the bottom of a cup. It's better if it's a springform pan, but you can also use a pan with a removable bottom. Put it in the fridge until the first layer is ready. \n3. Place 2.5 gelatin sheets into a small bowl of cold water. \n4. Add the dark chocolate and 1\/4 cup (60g) of heavy milk into a heat-proof bowl. Place it over a saucepan with simmering water, and at low heat, stir it until the chocolate is melted. \n5. Add the gelatin sheets to the bowl with the chocolate and mix it really well. Then let everything cool down to room temperature or until it doesn't feel warm to the touch (be careful not to leave it too long so the mixture doesn't set). \n6. Whip the cup (240g) of heavy milk (better if it's chilled) in a big bowl until stiff peaks, and then add the melted chocolate and mix until combined. \n7. Add the mixture to the pan with the crust, and even it out. Leave it in the fridge until the next layer. \n8. For the strawberry layer, add the strawberries to a food processor and blend until they are liquid. (Optional: After it's liquid, pass it through a sieve in case you don't want seeds.) \n9. Place three gelatin sheets into a small bowl of cold water. \n10. Add the strawberry liquid and 1\/4 cup (50g) of sugar to a medium-heat pan and stir until the sugar is mixed (a few mins).\n11. Place the resulting liquid into a bowl, add the gelatin sheets, and mix it really well. Then leave it in the fridge until it's not warm to the touch, around 30\u201360 minutes. If the gelatin has started to set, whisk well until smooth and loose again. \n12. Whip the 1 + 1\/4 cup (300g in total) of heavy milk (better if it's cold) until stiff peaks, and then add the strawberry mixture and mix until combined. \n13. Add the mixture over the first chocolate layer and leave it for at least 3 hours. \n14. To remove the cake from the pan, run a knife along the edges of the pan.\n15.  You can add optional cacao powder on top of the cake.",

However, keep in mind that in that case, the baking time may be longer.\n\n\\* parchment paper\n\n\\* mixing bowl\n\n\\* standing mixer or hand mixer\n\n\\* spatula\n\n\\* cooling rack (optional)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to prepare Polish Summer Fruit Cake:**\n\n**1.** Preheat the fan-assisted oven to 365\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Prepare a baking tray by greasing it lightly with oil and lining it with parchment paper to keep it in place.\n\n**2.** For the cake batter, in a mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar on high speed until pale and fluffy. Reduce the speed to medium and gradually add the eggs one by one, ensuring they are well incorporated. Then, add the vanilla bean paste.\n\n**3.** Stop the mixer and add the sifted flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix on low speed until the ingredients are fully incorporated. If the mixture appears too thick, add two tablespoons of milk or water and incorporate it.\n\n**4.** Using a spatula, transfer the batter to the prepared baking tray and spread it evenly. Arrange the fruit on top; you can halve the strawberries, cut the rhubarb into chunks, and quarter the apricots.\n\n**5.** To prepare the crumble topping, place all the crumble ingredients in a bowl and rub the mixture between your fingers until it is almost combined. Sprinkle the crumble evenly over the fruit.\n\n**6.** Place the baking tray on the middle shelf of the oven and bake for 40-45 minutes.\n\n**7.** Once the cake is ready, allow it to cool for 10 minutes before serving. You can transfer it to a cooling rack, using a sheet of paper and the help of another person to expedite the cooling process.\n\n**8.** Enjoy your delicious cake with a cup of coffee! Smacznego!\n\nBlog post: [Polish Summer Fruit Cake](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/polish-summer-fruit-cake)",

        "ingredient_comment":"**Recipe here originally: [Rhubarb Tart with Homemade Ice Cream](https:\/\/newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com\/p\/rhubarb-for-the-weekend)**\n\nServes: 10 | Cook time: 2 hours (plus 4 hours inactive time)\n\n**Tart filling:**\n\n* 1\u00bd pounds rhubarb, trimmed and chopped (4 cups chopped rhubarb total)\n* \u00bd cup sugar\n* \u00bd cup water\n* 4 drops of red food coloring, optional\n* 6 egg yolks\n* \u00bd cup sugar\n* 6 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter; cut into cubes\n\n**Rhubarb ice cream:**\n\n* 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 16 ounces heavy cream\n* \u00bd cup prepared rhubarb (from above)\n\n**Tart crust:**\n\n* \u00bd cup (53 g) whole pecans\n* 1 cup flour\n* \u00bc cup (32 g) powdered sugar\n* \u00bc teaspoon salt\n* \u00bd cup (1 stick) unsalted butter\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* For serving:\n* Powdered sugar, optional\n\n**Prepare the rhubarb:**\n\n1. Combine the chopped rhubarb, \u00bd cup sugar, and \u00bd cup water in a medium pot and bring to a boil.\n2. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 30\u201345 minutes until very soft.\n3. Use an immersion blender to blend until completely smooth. You may also use a traditional blender or food processor. Just pour the mixture back into the pot.\n4. Let the rhubarb cool completely. Add the food coloring, if using, and mix well to incorporate.\n5. Remove \u00bd cup of the rhubarb mixture from the pot and reserve for the homemade ice cream.\n\n**Make the ice cream:**\n\n1. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a medium mixing bowl and add the vanilla extract. Stir to combine.\n2. Pour the heavy cream into a large mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, mix on medium speed until thick, stiff peaks form.\n3. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into the heavy cream and gently fold everything together with a rubber spatula. Do not over-mix!\n4. Pour the cream mixture into an 8-inch cake pan or loaf pan. Drizzle the reserved \u00bd cup of rhubarb on top and use the rubber spatula to swirl and mix into the cream gently.\n5. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap. The wrap should be completely in contact with the ice cream without air bubbles. Use your hands to pat it down as tightly as possible. If there are air bubbles, ice crystals will form and make the top of your ice cream icy. Be sure the wrap is in contact with the ice cream from edge to edge. Transfer to the freezer until it is completely frozen, at least 4 hours.\n\n**Prepare the tart crust:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 350\u00baF.\n2. Place the pecans in a food processor and pulse them into a fine meal. Transfer to a mixing bowl with the flour and powdered sugar. Add \u00bc teaspoon salt.\n3. Melt the butter in the microwave or a small saucepan over the stovetop. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Let stand for 5 minutes. Pour the butter into the bowl of flour and pecans and use a rubber spatula to mix until there are no dry bits of flour and the dough is smooth and moist.\n4. Place the dough into a 10\u201d greased pie dish or tart pan. Use your hands to smooth it into the dish and up the sides in an even layer. Transfer to the oven for 15 minutes. Remove and let stand for 30 minutes. Keep the oven at 350\u00baF.\n\n**Finish the filling:**\n\n1. Add the egg yolks and remaining \u00bd cup sugar to the pot of the remaining rhubarb. Turn the heat back to medium and whisk until completely smooth.\n2. Add the cold, cubed butter and continue whisking until the heat melts the butter completely. It will take 2\u20133 minutes of regular whisking. Continue whisking until completely smooth. Turn off the heat and immediately pour into the prepared crust.\n\n**Bake the tart:**\n\n1. Transfer the tart to the oven for 15 minutes; carefully rotate the tart once midway through cooking.\n2. After 15 minutes, remove from the oven and do a jiggle check. It should be set up around the edges and slightly jiggly in the middle. It should wobble, not slosh. If it\u2019s still very jiggly around the edges, return to the oven and continue baking in 2-minute increments until the tart is set around the edges but still jiggly in the middle. It should not need more than 20 minutes in the oven.\n\n**Finish the tart:**\n\n1. Let the tart stand for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, transfer to the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight before serving.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Slice the tart and carefully remove each piece. If you made this in a pie dish, it will be more difficult to serve but not impossible! Dust the tart with powdered sugar and serve with rhubarb ice cream on top. Enjoy!",

[Original recipe and a couple of tips](https:\/\/grillmangal.art\/en\/dessert-in-a-glass\/)\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* Milk \u2013 150 ml\n* Cornstarch \u2013 1 tablespoon (8-10 g)\n* Sugar \u2013 1 tablespoon (15 g)\n* Egg (60-65 g) \u2013 1 piece\n* Vanilla sugar (or extract) \u2013 1 teaspoon (5 g)\n* Cocoa powder \u2013 2 teaspoons (for decoration)\n* Orange \u2013 1 slice (for serving)\n\n**Cooking process:**\n\n1. In a small saucepan, whisk the egg (using a fork or mixer, it\u2019s better to use a mixer for this recipe).\n2. Add the sugar and gradually add all the cornstarch.\n3. Beat well until the sugar is completely dissolved.\n4. Gradually and carefully, while stirring, add the milk. Do it gradually to avoid lumps\n5. Place the saucepan over medium heat and, stirring constantly, bring the mixture to a boil\n6. Reduce the heat and cook, stirring, for another 2-3 minutes until the mixture thickens to the desired consistency.\n7. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the vanilla, and mix well.\n8. Allow the mixture to cool for about 15 minutes.\n9. Transfer the mixture to glasses. According to this recipe, you\u2019ll get exactly 2 glasses\n10. Usually, cocoa powder is used for decoration just before serving, but I like a dark brown crust, so I add cocoa powder while the dessert is still warm. Here\u2019s how to add cocoa powder: Cover the glass halfway with paper or a knife, sprinkle cocoa powder into a sieve, and sift it onto our glass, you can create any pattern you like.\n11. Place the dessert in the refrigerator for 30-40 minutes.\n12. Remove the dessert, decorate with a slice of orange.\n13. Enjoy!\n\nThat\u2019s the whole recipe!\r  \n\r  \nCook with pleasure!",

        "ingredient_comment":"This recipe comes from my mother-in-law\u2019s grandmother, Grandma Warner and it\u2019s one I make a few times a year now during strawberry season. Grandma Warner formed them into 3 large biscuits, but I do 4 smaller biscuits to keep it even. No need to change any of the quantities; just make them a bit smaller.\n\nYou can make them precisely as listed above and they\u2019ll be delicious and easy. I use butter instead of shortening. Right before baking, I also brush the tops with melted butter and sprinkle on a bit of turbinado sugar.\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 1 pint strawberries or mixed berries\n* 1\u20132 tablespoons granulated sugar\n* 1 cup sifted flower\n* \u00bd teaspoon salt\n* 2 teaspoons baking powder\n* 2 tablespoons shortening or cold butter\n* Whole milk, about 5\u20136 tablespoons or so\n* 1 tablespoon melted butter\n* Pinch of turbinado sugar, optional\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n* 1 tablespoon vanilla pudding powder, optional\n\n**Before starting:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 425\u00baF. Set aside a baking sheet for the biscuits.\n\n**Prepare the berries:**\n\n1. Rinse the berries and transfer them to a saucepan. Sprinkle 1\u20132 tablespoons sugar on top. Turn the heat to medium. As soon as the berries begin to bubble, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15\u201320 minutes. Lightly mash a few of the berries to thicken the syrup further. Turn off the heat and set aside.\n\n**Prepare the biscuits:**\n\n1. Combine the sifted flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Cut in the shortening or butter using a fork or your fingers until the mixture becomes crumbly, the size of peas.\n2. Work in the milk, a few tablespoons at a time, until it becomes a soft, sticky dough.\n3. Form the dough into 4 rough biscuits. They don\u2019t need to be rolled into perfect circles; the rough edges will crisp up and be better than perfect dough balls!\n4. Transfer the biscuits to the baking sheet. Brush each biscuit with melted butter and sprinkle a pinch of turbinado sugar on top of each biscuit.\n5. Transfer to the oven for 11\u201312 minutes. The bottoms will be golden brown and the the top will be a very light golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.\n\n**Prepare the whipped cream:**\n\n1. While the biscuits bake, place the cream in a large bowl with the vanilla extract. If you\u2019d like a more stabilized whipped cream, add the vanilla pudding powder. Using a hand mixer, mix on medium speed until stiff peaks form. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. You can make them precisely as listed above, and they\u2019ll be delicious and easy. I use butter instead of shortening. Right before baking, I also brush the tops with melted butter and sprinkle on a bit of turbinado sugar.",

Scald the milk (bring it to a boil and immediately remove from heat). Allow it to cool to a warm (not hot) temperature (\\~110-115\u00baF).\n2. Add the yeast to the milk and mix well. Set aside and rest for 5-7 minutes.\n3. In a stand mixer bowl, add flour, butter, granulated sugar, eggs, salt, and activated yeast mixture. With a dough hook, stir, then then knead on low for about 15-20 minutes, just before it reaches window pane texture.\n4. Turn out the dough onto a prep surface and knead until it has a window pane texture (when thinned out, light comes through it without the dough breaking).\n5. Form dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for 60-90 minutes until doubled in size.\n\nWhile dough is rising, prepare the filling:\n\n1. mix brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl until fully mixed. \n2. Add the butter, and mix until incorporated. Set aside.\n\nOnce the dough has finished rising:\n\n1. Turn out the dough onto prep surface. Flatten to remove the air bubbles.\n2. Roll the dough out into approx. 1\u201d\/2cm thick in a rectangular shape, then fold and press it into thirds. \n3. Flip the dough and roll out to a 12x18\u201d\/30x45cm rectangle, about 1\/2\u201d1cm thick.\n4. Spread filling evenly onto rolled dough, leaving a 1\/2\u201d\/1cm edge.\n5. With a wheel pastry cutter or pizza cutter, cut the dough into thirds (widthwise, perpendicular to the longer side), then cut each third into thirds again to make 9 rolls.\n6. Roll each strip and tuck the end into the roll. Place the rolls, tucked side down, into a 9x13\u201d\/22x33cm baking dish lined with parchment paper.\n7. Tent the rolls with plastic wrap, and let them rise again for 15-30 minutes.\n8. While rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 350\u00baF\/180\u00baC.\n\nWhile the oven preheats, prepare the icing:\n\n1. Beat cream cheese, butter, vanilla extract, and powdered sugar until smooth. Set aside.\n\nOnce the oven is preheated:\n\n1. Bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes, until lightly golden on the top.\n2. Immediately after removing the rolls from the oven, spread a layer of icing onto them.\n\nServe warm, add additional icing if desired.",

Today, I will guide you through a super simple recipe for Polish Apple Pancakes, also known as \"Racuchy z Jab\u0142kami\":)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This recipe makes: 6 portions**\n\n**Ingredients for Polish Apple Pancakes:**\n\n\\* 2 medium-sized apples, peeled and diced into small pieces\n\n\\* 1egg\n\n\\* 3tbsp of sugar\n\n\\* 1tsp of baking powder\n\n\\* 1.5 cups of plain flour (185g)\n\n\\* 0.5 cup of milk (125ml)\n\n\\* 1\/2 lemon juice (skip if your apples are already very sour)\n\n\\* 1tsp of vanilla extract\n\n\\* oil for frying\n\n\\* icing sugar for dusting\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to prepare Polish Apple Pancakes:**\n\n**1.** In a bowl, mix the diced apples with the juice of half a lemon. Set aside until later. Skip the lemon juice if the apples are already sour enough.\n\n**2.** In a separate mixing bowl, whisk 1 egg and 3 tbsp of sugar until pale yellow, which should take around 2 minutes.\n\n**3.** Add 1 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, and milk. Whisk the mixture until it's smooth and free of lumps. If the batter seems too thick, add 20ml more milk. Keep in mind that higher protein flour absorbs more liquid.\n\n**4.** Fold in the diced apples and mix them into the batter. (Alternatively you can grate them instead for different texture)\n\n**5.** Heat a frying pan over medium heat with 1 tbsp of oil. Add 2 tbsp of pancake mix to the pan, and spread it slightly into the desired shape. Fry the pancake on each side for around 2 minutes. If the pancake browns too quickly, turn down the heat.\n\n**6.** Once the pancake is cooked, dust it with icing sugar, and enjoy your delicious Polish apple pancake (Racuchy z Jab\u0142kami)!\n\nOriginally Posted: [**Apple Pancakes from Poland**](https:\/\/chefsbinge.com\/polish-apple-pancakes-racuchy-z-jablkami\/)",

Preheat the oven to 230\u00baC\/445\u00baF. \n2. Separate the eggs.\n3. Beat the egg yolks with 55g of sugar on high until light and fluffy (about 4 minutes). Should have a ribbon consistency. Set aside.\n4. Beat the egg whites on high. Once they have turned white, add the 35g of sugar slowly and steadily. Beat to soft peaks and set aside.\n5. Sift cornstarch and flour into a bowl. \n6. Fold about 1\/3 of the egg whites into the egg yolk. Once nearly incorporated, sift 1\/3 of the cornstarch and flour and fold gently into the mix, careful not to deflate the batter.\n7. Repeat #6 and gently fold just until all ingredients are incorporated.\n8. Put the batter in a piping bag fitted with a 1A tip.\n9. Pipe into 8cm\/3\u201d circles onto a baking sheet lined with parchment (aim for rounds that are slightly smaller in circumference than the serving glasses). For ladyfingers, pipe into 10cm\/4\" tubes.\n10. generously dust with powdered sugar and bake for 4-6 minutes until lightly golden. watch them carefully as they can easily burn.\n11. Allow to cool completely on the baking sheet. \n\nCream:\n\n1. While the biscuits are cooling, beat the whipping cream and powdered sugar in a bowl until just lightly whipped.\n2. In a separate bowl, spread the mascarpone and stir in the lightly whipped cream in 2-3 batches.\n3. Put the cream into a piping bag fitted with a 1A tip.\n\nAssembly:\n\n1. Pipe one layer of cream in the bottom of the serving cup or bowl. \n2. Completely dunk a biscuit in the coffee, turning it over to make sure it is saturated, and layer it on top of the cream layer. Repeat and top with a final cream layer.\n3. The layers should be: cream, biscuit, cream, biscuit, and one final cream layer. Dust the top with cocoa powder and serve.\n\nNote:  \nTo enhance the coffee flavor, pour a bit of the coffee on top of each saturated biscuit layer before piping cream over it.",

Preheat the oven to 180\u00baC\/355\u00baF.\n2. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl and whisk together. Set aside.\n3. Beat the eggs, vegetable oil, milk, and vanilla until fully incorporated. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients and mix just until incorporated (no lumps).\n4. Lightly butter the inside of the bundt pan. \n5. Pour 150g of cajeta into the pan and distribute along the bottom.\n6. Pour the cake batter into the pan and set aside while you make the flan mix.\n7. In a separate bowl or in a blender jar, combine the eggs, sugar, milk, and vanilla. Blend with an immersion blender (or stand blender) just until mixed, no more than 10 seconds.\n8. Rap the bowl\/jar on the counter a few times to bring any air bubbles to the top.\n9. Pour the flan mix through a strainer gently into the pan, right over the cake batter. (This is the \u201cimpossible\u201d part, the leavening agents in the cake batter will cause it to rise, while the flan will sink to the bottom of the pan)\n10. Place the pan in a deep baking pan and pour hot water into the baking pan, about 1.5\u201d high.\n11. Bake at 180\u00baC\/355\u00baF for 1 hour.\n12. Once done baking, remove the pan from the Bain Marie and allow to cool completely. Cover with plastic wrap and chill overnight.\n13. The next day, invert the pan onto a serving dish and gently tap\/rap until the cake drops from the pan. \n14. Drizzle with warmed cajeta (this makes it easier to pour), and top with strawberry slices if desired. Drizzle a bit more cajeta on the top. \n15. Cut and serve.",

I would also really appreciate any follows on social media channels if you like the site!\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n* 6 large egg whites\n* 335g caster sugar (super fine sugar in the US)\n* 300ml rich double cream\n* 180ml lemon curd\n* 250g raspberries\n* 250g blueberries\n* 70g crushed de-shelled pistachios\n* 2 passion fruit\n* fresh mint\n\n**METHOD**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 150\u00b0C (300\u00b0F). Line a flat tray with parchment paper, you will be baking the meringue on this and don't want it to stick to the surface. I use a 38cm \u00d7 35cm tray, but you can use any large flat rectangular tray that will fit into your oven. You will be rolling along the longer edge, so this will be the finished length of your roulade.\n2. Add the egg whites and half the caster sugar to a bowl, making sure that it's clean and completely dry before beginning. If there is any moisture left in the bowl, the egg whites won't form. whisk the mixture until it's formed light peaks. Once they have formed, gradually add the other half of the sugar until it forms stiff glossy peaks. This will take about 10-15 minutes. \n3. Spread the meringue mixture evenly onto the lined tray, squaring off the edges as best you can. Place in the oven and bake for one hour. It should be a very light golden colour when it's done. \n4. Remove tray from the oven and turn upside down onto a fresh sheet of parchment paper. Carefully peel off the backing sheet, working slowly and with a knife to scrape the paper gently away in one piece. There will be pockets of carmelised sugar stuck to the paper you want to get all those pieces off as they add a lovely gooey texture. \n5. Whip the double cream until thick and gently fold in the lemon curd, keeping the air you've incorporated during whipping. Spread the cream and curd mix over the flat meringue and cover with a layer of raspberries and blueberries, about 2\/3 of the amount. \n6. Make a light score with a knife about 2cm in along one long edge of the meringue, this is going to help you as a starting point to roll it. From the indent, gently roll inwards away from yourself, using the paper underneath to help turn it as you go. You shouldn't be touching the surface of the meringue with your hands, use the paper to do that for you. The \"seam' will sit on the bottom once it's rolled. The outer surface will crack a little bit, you can patch it up if need be once it's served. \n7. When the roll is almost complete, grab the paper and use it to help you transfer the roulade to a plate. It's helpful if you have someone to give you a hand shifting it onto the serving plate, they can hold the plate steady while you transfer. Decorate with the remaining berries, crushed pistachios, passion fruit and mint.",

Activate the yeast. Mix the dry yeast with the warm water and half a teaspoon of the sugar and set aside for 5 minutes.\n2. In a bowl, sift 145g of the flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar, and salt. Set aside.\n3. In a separate bowl, beat the egg with the warm milk, melted butter, and vanilla. \n4. Once the yeast is activated, pour yeast mixture and egg mixture into the bowl with dry ingredients and mix well. The mixture will be wet.\n5. Sift the remaining 200g of flour into the bowl and mix until incorporated.\n6. Turn out the dough onto your working surface and knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is elastic and springy. At the beginning, if the dough is very sticky, lightly sprinkle flour to the prep surface (do not exceed 1 tsp of flour).\n7. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover. Allow to rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in size. \n8. Make the filling while the dough is rising.\n9. While the filling cools, turn back to the dough. \n10. Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto prep surface and press out air bubbles.\n11. Shape into a 1\u201d thick rectangle and divide evenly into 6 pieces.\n12. Roll out each piece into a ball and flatten and shape into a bowl shape.\n13. Spoon about one heaping teaspoon of filling into the dough bowl and wrap the dough around the filling, pinching tightly to avoid the filling from oozing out. Flatten a bit.\n14. Place each filled bun onto a baking sheet and cover. Allow to rest for 30 minutes. While the dough is rising, make the icing.\n15. Once the dough has risen a second time, heat the vegetable oil to 375\u00baF\/190\u00baC.\n16. Gently lower doughnuts into the oil and fry for 90-120 seconds per side. Make sure that the oil temp stays at temperature. Do not crowd the pot.\n17. While the doughnuts are still hot, dip each one into the icing and place them onto a baking sheet. The icing should firm (not harden) by the time the doughnuts are cool enough to eat.\n18. To serve, you can also spoon a bit of the filling on top of the doughnut.  \n\n*Filling*\n\n1. Combine peeled and chopped apple in a pot with brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and sugar. \n2. Heat on the stove on medium heat until the mixture has thickened and the sauce has a syrupy texture.\n3. Allow to cool. \n\n*Icing*\n\n1. In a mixer bowl with a whisk attachment, combine the powdered sugar, butter, cream cheese, and half and half and mix, first on low and working up to medium speed.\n2. pour the icing into a bowl, cover, and set aside.",

So here's the lime jellies recipe (they're very sour!). As always, you can watch the [detailed video here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/6_2f7OXR8iI) (I'd appreciate it if you'd take a look).\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 920 grams (32.5 oz) of limes\n* 180 grams (6 oz) of lemons\n* 25 grams (1 oz) of gelatine\n* 140-180 grams (5-6 oz) of sugar\n* 1 gram (1\/2 tsp) of vanillin\n* green food colouring (optional)\n\n**Cooking method:**\n\n1. Remove the zest from 2 limes. Then cut all the limes and lemons in half and squeeze the juice out of them (you should have about 400 ml or 1 &amp; 2\/3 cup).\n2. Pour half of the juice into a saucepan. Add the zest, vanilla and sugar (140 to 180 grams, depending on how sweet you want your jellies).\n3. Add the gelatin to the second half of the juice. Stir and leave it for 15 to 30 minutes.\n4. Put the saucepan with the first part of the juice on the fire and bring to a boil. Once boiling, simmer for 2-3 minutes, and then remove from the heat.\n5. Combine both parts of the juice and mix well. Add the food coloring if desired. Then take a mold, cover it with clingfilm and pour the juice into it through a sieve. Put it in the fridge until completely solidified (I recommend leaving it for 1-2 days).\n6. When the jelly sets, take it out of the form and cut into cubes. Dessert is ready, enjoy! Be sure to store it in the fridge.",

I'd be happy if you watch it.\n\n**Ingredients:**\r\n\n**For Lime Ice Cream:**\r\n\n* 300 ml (10 fl oz) of milk\r\n* 300 ml (10 fl oz) of cream \r\n* 100 grams (1\/2 cup) of sugar\n* 3 limes\r\n* 3 egg yolks\r\n\n**For Pumpkin Ice Cream:**\r\n\n* 300 grams (10.6 oz) of pumpkin\r\n* 300 ml (10 fl oz) of cream\n* 130 grams (2\/3 cup) of sugar\r\n* 4 large egg yolks\r\n* 4 cloves\r\n* 1\/2 tsp of cinnamon\r\n\n**For Banana Ice Cream:**\r\n\n* 3 bananas\r\n* 50 grams (1\/4 cup) of sugar\r\n* 100 ml (3.4 fl oz) of cream\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cooking method for pumpkin \ud83c\udf83 ice cream:**\n\n1. Peel the pumpkin and cut into cubes. Put it in a saucepan and add the ground cinnamon, cloves, sugar and cream.\r\n2. Put on high heat and bring to a boil. When it begins to boil - reduce the heat and simmer for about 13-17 minutes. Then blend the pumpkin until smooth.\r\n3. In a bowl, whisk 4 egg yolks. Then slowly add them to the pumpkin, mixing constantly. Cook for 5 minutes over medium heat, stirring all the time.\r\n4. Pour the mixture into a bowl and place in the freezer for 5-6 hours. Stir it every 30-50 minutes to ensure the ice cream freezes evenly. I recommend using salted peanuts as decoration!\n\n**Cooking method for banana \ud83c\udf4c ice cream:**\r\n\nCut the banana into pieces and put it in the freezer for 4 hours. Then mix them in a blender with the sugar and cream. Add any topping (for example, pieces of chocolate or strawberries), pour it into a mold and put it in the freezer for 5 hours. Stir the ice cream every 30-50 minutes so that it freezes evenly.\r\n\n**Cooking method for lime \ud83c\udf4b ice cream:**\r\n\n1. Mix 3 yolks and sugar. Bring the milk to the boil, then add to the yolks and stir. Place this mixture in a bain-marie and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring constantly. Then put it in the freezer for 40 minutes.\r\n2. Remove the zest of 3 limes and squeeze out the juice. Whisk the cream in a bowl. Then add the mixture from the first step, the lime zest and lime juice one at a time, stirring each time. Place the ice cream in a container and place it in the freezer for 5 hours. Also, like the previous ice creams, this should be stirred every 30-50 minutes so it freezes evenly.",

See how I made it [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/r4VqvQHI_gI).\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n* 4 eggs, room temperature\n* 100g caster sugar\n* 100g cake flour\n* Tsp vanilla extract\n* 500ml whipping cream\n* 50g caster sugar\n* 6g powdered gelatin\n* 4 tbsp cold water\n* 125-150g strawberry jam\n* 250g semi sweet chocolate\n* 90g unsalted butter\n* Pinch of salt\n\n**Method***Sponge*\n\n1. In a mixer bowl, beat eggs, 100g caster sugar, and vanilla.\n2. Put the mixer bowl in a warm water bath and mix well until the mix has warmed.\n3. Mix on medium-high until fluffy and pale (10 minutes).\n4. Sift and fold in cake flour in batches, ensuring each batch is fully mixed in before adding more flour. Be careful not to deflate the batter\n5. Line a baking pan with parchment. Pour in the batter and spread evenly. Drop the pan onto the prep counter a couple of times to remove air bubbles.\n6. Bake at 180\u00baC\/355\u00baF for 10-12 minutes, until lightly golden.\n7. While the sponge is baking, dust a clean tea cloth generously with powdered sugar.\n8. When the sponge is done baking, immediately invert it onto the tea towel and remove the parchment. While still hot, roll up the sponge gently (with the tea towel as if they were one) and allow to cool completely in rolled form.\n\n*Chantilly*\n\n1. Bloom the gelatin. Dust the gelatin powder into the cold water and mix well to remove any lumps. Put the gelatin dish in an ice water water bath.\n2. Whisk the whipping cream and sugar until lightly fluffy and set aside.\n3. Remove the gelatin dish from the ice bath and put it in a hot water bath and stir until it is fully liquid.\n4. Scoop 1\/3 of the whipped cream in a separate bowl. Add the gelatin and mix well until incorporated (careful not to overmix).\n5. Return the gelatin and cream to the whipped cream bowl and mix well until it reaches a thicker (but not over mixed) consistency.\n\n*Assembly*\n\n1. Once the sponge is totally cooled, unroll it gently, remove the tea towel, and set the sponge on a sheet of parchment. Spread a layer of jam, followed by a layer of whipped cream on the sponge.\n2. Gently roll into shape, taking care not to squeeze the filling out of the sides. The parchment can help guide the form, but should not be rolled into the cake.\n3. Wrap the cake in the parchment sheet, and refrigerate for 4 hours minimum and up to overnight. For longer refrigeration, cover the cake to prevent it from drying out.\n\n*Chocolate shell*\n\n1. Melt the chocolate and butter in a double boiler and add salt. Mix until liquid.\n2. Remove the chilled cake from the refrigerator and set on a grate\/rack. For neater edges, trim the sides of the cake to achieve a straight edge. Pour the chocolate onto the cake, taking care to cover the sides where it curves under.\n3. Refrigerate 1 hour before serving.",

Yields \\~22-24 pops.\n\nYou can see how I made them [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/2-UHpZe1Qno).\n\n*INGREDIENTS:*\n\n**Sponge**\n\n* 300g all purpose flour\n* 2 tsp baking powder\n* 1 tsp salt\n* 170g unsalted butter, room temperature\n* 220g granulated sugar\n* 115 Greek yogurt\n* 1 tsp vanilla extract\n* 1 egg, room temperature\n* 250ml milk, room temperature\n\n**Frosting**\n\n* 200g unsalted butter, room temperature\n* Pinch of salt\n* 1\/2 tsp vanilla extract\n* 3 tbs whipping cream\n\n**Coating**\n\n* 400g candy melts, white chocolate, or milk chocolate\n* Coconut oil or commercial thinning flakes, to thin the coating if needed\n* Sprinkles, if desired.\n\n*METHOD:*\n\n**Sponge**\n\n1. In a bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and salt and mix well. Set aside.with a stand or hand mixer, beat butter and sugar. When sugar is fully incorporated, add yogurt, vanilla, egg, and milk and mix thoroughly.\n2. Slowly add the dry ingredients and mix on low until fully incorporated.Pour the batter into two 8\u2019 pans lined with parchment paper.\n3. Bake at 350\u00baF\/176\u00baC for 25-30 minutes. The cake will be done when a toothpick is inserted and comes out clean.\n4. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes. Then, invert the cakes onto a cooling rack and allow to cool completely.\n\n**Frosting**\n\n1. Beat butter. Sift in powdered sugar in batches and mix well in between.\n2. Once sugar is fully mixed into the butter, add the salt and vanilla extract and mix.\n3. Add the whipping cream, about a tablespoon at a time, and beat on high until frosting is even and fluffy.\n\n**Cake Ball Assembly**\n\n1. Crumble the cake evenly into a bowl. Remove any tough pieces.Add approximately 75-100g of frosting. Mix until the frosting is evenly distributed among the cake, ensuring the cake retains a crumbly texture.\n2. To test, gently squeeze some of the mix into a ball. If it retains its shape, it should be ready.Roll into 30g balls and place onto a lined cookie sheet.\n3. Refrigerate for 2 hours minimum.\n\n**Coating**\n\n1. Melt the candy melts\/chocolate. If it is too thick, it can be thinned down with refined cocounut oil or commercial thinning flakes. Add just a little at a time and mix well to avoid cracking or an uneven finish.\n2. Dip a lollipop stick into the coating and insert the stick into the cake ball.\n3. Dip the cake ball into the coating and gently tap the side to remove excess.\n4. Spoon sprinkles onto the cake pop.\n5. Insert the stick into a styrofoam block and allow the coating to set for 1 hour minimum.",

Set up a double-boiler and add the white chocolate morsels and half-n-half. Stir occasionally.\n2. In a small pot, put the butter on a low heat to melt.\n3. In a small mixing bowl add the Graham cracker crumbs and \u00bc cup sugar, and mix thoroughly.\n4. In a large mixing bowl add \u00bd cup sugar, the vanilla and the cream cheese.\n5. Mix in the three eggs one at a time, mixing as little as possible; you just want to distribute the eggs through the mixture. I use a large serving fork, and only \u201cpull\u201d through the cream cheese 3 times for each egg.\n6. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.\n7. Spray a springform pan with a medium-to-heavy coat of spray on oil.\n8. Add the melted butter to the smaller mixing bowl and mix thoroughly. \u201cDump\u201d the small mixing bowl contents into the springform pan, distribute evenly, and tamp down lightly and evenly with something with a flat bottom (I use a drinking glass). Only press down with about 18 to 20 pounds of pressure.\n9. Stir the chocolate until it's fully melted. Add the melted chocolate to the large mixing bowl.\n10. Using a hand mixer on the lowest setting, mix the batter until the largest \u201cshreds\u201d of cream cheese you can see are about 1\/8 inch long.\n11. Pour the batter into the springform pan, and cover with aluminum foil. Lightly crimp the foil around the top of the pan all the way around.\n12. Place in the oven for 1 hour.\n13. After the hour, shut the oven off and prop the door open very slightly; don\u2019t open it to the first \u201cdetent\u201d (about 3 inches); I use the handle of a wooden spoon inserted as little as possible to keep it in place. After two hours, take the cheesecake out of the oven and put it on the counter for two hours.\n14. Take off the foil; at this point you will think the it's \u201cunderdone\u201d. The middle will have the consistency of cheesecake pudding. Release the \u201clock\u201d on the springform pan and use a dinner knife to separate the cheesecake from the pan by running it around the inside edge of the pan. Then open the lock fully and lift the outer part of the pan off the base.\n15. Put it in the refrigerator at least 12 hours, 24 is better.",

Pour into a rectangular mold, cool down for 1 hour, fridge for a few hours\r  \n\nTIPS\n\n* Using milk chocolate gives you the unmissable sweetness, but if you're a fan of dark chocolate, then just replace and add a little more sugar to balance things out.\n* Use a spatula to help pry it loose from the mold, it should come out pretty easily after the sides have been loosened\n* Eat it as is, or with whipped cream for that texture differential.\n* The pudding is much much better cold, so be sure to keep it in the fridge for a few hours after it has cooled down. DO NOT KEEP THE HOT PUDDING IN THE FRIDGE, it will raise the temperature of the fridge significantly, giving possibility to spoil other things.\n\nIf you prefer a video format, [the link is here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/-9NVhtWJHY0)",

Top the ice-cream cake with berries and mint leaves drizzle over a little warm sauce. Slice and serve immediately with extra sauce.",

It is very tasty please give it a try! \n\nTart Crust:\n\n- Butter 100g\n- Powdered Sugar 72g\n- Almond Powder \/ Meal 20g\n- Cornstarch 30g\n- Eggs 36g\n- Cake Flour 170g\n- Salt\n\nChocolate Filling:\n\n- Ruby Chocolate 200g\n- Cream 200g\n\nRaspberry Top:\n\n- Raspberries 160g\n- Water 160g\n- Sugar 50g\n- Gelatin 2 tsp + 40ml Water\n\nExtra:\n\n- Fresh Raspberries\n- Neutral Glaze\n\n\u200b----\n\nRecipe:\n\nTart:\n\n1. Cream Butter slightly, Add Salt\n2. Sift in Powdered Sugar, Almond meal\/powder, 3. Cornstarch and mix until combined\n4. Mix in room temp eggs little by little until fully combined\n5. Sift in Cake Flour and mix until barely just combined\n6. Knead it by scrapping the dough against a rolling mat, until fully homogenous\n7. Place it between two sheets of parchment and roll to about ~3mm thickness\n8. Place in the fridge minimum 2 hours (better overnight)\n9. Get your perforated ring mold and grease it fully\n10. Cut the dough with the ring (it will stick to the bottom of the ring, move quickly though since it melts very fast) and place it on a silicon baking mat\n11. Cut strips according to the circumference of the ring and quickly place it in the edges of the ring, connecting any broken\/short pieces with more strips (glue it with your hand, the heat will help combine two strips together)\n12. Freeze for 20 min until rock hard\n13. Bake at 170C for 15-20 minutes (check for colour). Wait for it to cool and take it out of the ring\n\n\u200b\n\nChocolate Filling:\n\n1. Heat up the cream\n2. Pour over the ruby chocolate, mix until melter\n3. Pour over the tarts 70% filled, freeze for 1 hour\n\n\u200b\n\nRaspberry Jelly:\n\n1. Take the raspberries and place it in a pot, add sugar and water\n2. While it is boiling and reducing, bloom 2 tsp of gelatin in cold water\n3. Remove the raspberry mix after it reduced a bit and the raspberries are mush\n4. Wait until it has cooled to 60C and add the bloomed gelatin, mix well\n5. Wait until 30C and pour over the tarts completely filling any gap\n6. Keep in the fridge minimum 2 hours until set\n\n\u200b\n\nDecorations:\n\n- Use Fresh Raspberries\n- Use neutral glaze (from supermarket) and brush over the top for amazing shine\n\n\u200b\n[video recipe here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SK0Plyuy6P0)",

Line a strainer or a small colander with cheesecloth. Set this contraption over a deep container or bowl (so that the whey can strain out the bottom without touching the strainer). Put the sour cream into the strainer and cover tightly with plastic wrap or a plastic bag and put it in the refrigerator until it has a thick texture and some amount of whey liquid has been released(at least 24 hours but up to 2 days).\n2. Add granulated sugar, honey, unsalted butter, eggs, salt and baking soda to a medium saucepan and melt them together over medium\/low heat, whisking occasionally until sugar is completely dissolved. Don\u2019t put them over high heat to prevent boiling.\n3. Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a standing mixer with the paddle attachment. Then add sifted all-purpose flour and start mixing for a few minutes on a medium speed until the dough reaches a clay consistency and doesn\u2019t stick to the bowl.\n4. Cut the dough into 15 equal pieces(77g each) and let it chill for a few hours or overnight in the fridge.\n5. Take your dough out of the fridge and let it warm up a little bit. On a well-floured surface, roll each piece out into a thin 22cm circle. You can sprinkle the top with a little flour too to keep dough from sticking to your rolling pin.\n6. Using a cake ring(you can use a lid from a saucepan) cut each dough circle to make a perfect shape. Keep the scraps for later! Place each dough circle on a parchment paper and pierce with a fork all over the surface to prevent air bubbles. Bake in the oven at 200C(392F) for 6-7 minutes until golden brown. Let them cool completely.\n7. Finally, bake the scraps separated evenly on a re-used sheet of parchment. Once the scraps are baked, cooled and firm, you can crush them with a rolling pin or pulse them in a food processor until you have fine crumbs.\n8. Beat heavy cream with powdered sugar until fluffy and stiff peaks form (1-2 min on high speed). Add strained sour cream and mix gently. You can also add vanilla extract, lemon zest or juice to your taste.\n9. Place the first cake onto a turntable and top it with 6-8 tablespoons of frosting; spread it gently and equally until its surface is completely covered. Place the next cake over the frosting layer without pressing it down. Repeat the process until all the layers have been stacked and topped with the sour cream frosting. Frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting.\n10. Dust the top and sides with your cakecrumbs, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. This cake needs time to absorb some of the cream and soften, so be patient. It\u2019s worth the wait!\n11. Place finely chopped chocolate in a microwave safe bowl. Microwave for 15 seconds; remove the bowl from the microwave and stir. ... - Repeat the process until most of the chocolate has melted and is smooth. At this point add yellow food coloring and mix everything thoroughly.\n12. Place the bubble wrap bubble-side up on a flat surface. Pour the chocolate on top of the bubble wrap. Spread it fairly thick: you don't want to see the shape of the bubbles beneath. Let it chill out in the fridge. Gently peel off the bubble wrap. Cut it with a cake ring 2-3cm smaller than the actual cake.\n13. Place chocolate honeycomb on top of the cake. Using a star nozzle, pipe swirls of frosting around the top of the cake. You can also fill hexagonal cells with honey.\n\n***Size:***\n\nShape - round\n\nWeight - 2,2kg\n\nHeight - 10cm\n\nDiameter - 22cm\n\n***Nutrition facts per 100g:***\n\nCalories - 341\n\nCarbs - 39\n\nFat - 18\n\nProtein - 4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cook-Shoot-Enjoy-Repeat!**",

Prepare a 18cm(7-inch) baking pan; set aside.\n\n2.Sift dry ingredients together. Place sugar, eggs and salt into a mixer bowl and whisk until light and fluffy. Add dry ingredients(in 2 batches) into the batter and mix on a low speed. Add milk and melted butter and continue mixing. At the end add boiling water and mix until well combined.\n\n3.Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and put it in the oven and bake for 40min until done. Insert a toothpick into the center of the cake if it comes out clean, it is done. Remove from the oven and turn the cake over onto the cooling rack. When the cake is completely cooled, cover it with plastic cling wrap and put in the fridge to rest overnight.\n\n4.Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan. Put the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring it to a gentle boil. Do not stir the caramel. Gently swirl the pot to even out the sauce. Cook the caramel until it is a golden-brown color. Remove from the heat and add hot milk while whisking. Leave it aside to cool down a little then add the butter and salt, mix well till everything is incorporated.\n\n5.Beat heavy cream with powdered sugar, cream cheese and vanilla extract until thick and smooth.\n\n6.Using a large serrated knife, level the top of the cake and split into 3-4 layers of equal thickness.Using a palette knife, spread about 3-4 tablespoons of the frosting evenly across the bottom layer. Using a round piping nozzle, pipe a ring of frosting around the edge of the cake.Spread a layer of the caramel in the middle of the cake, then sprinkle with crushed shortcake biscuits. Repeat for the next layer.\n\n7.Top the cake with the final layer, and spread the cream cheese frosting on the top and sides of the cake. Use a palette knife or cake side scraper to take off the excess buttercream and give a smooth finish. Chill the frosted cake for 15 minutes in the fridge, to allow the layer of frosting to firm up.\n\n8.Add another layer of frosting to the top and sides of the cake, and remove the excess. Chill the frosted cake for another 15 minutes in the fridge.\n\n9.Pour heavy cream into a microwave-safe bowl; heat in the microwave on high until very hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chocolate chips to heated cream; whisk until smooth. Set aside to firm up a little \u2013 you want the ganache to be pourable but not too runny.\n\n10.Fill the piping bag or squeeze bottle with the ganache you\u2019ve made. Place the edge of the piping bag on the edge of the cake and gently squeeze the bag \u2013 the more you squeeze the more it will drip. Make it all around the cake.\n\n11.Using a star nozzle, pipe swirls of frosting around the top of the cake; then spread another layer of the caramel, and sprinkle with crushed shortcake biscuits.\n\n12.Top each swirl with a piece of Twix mini-bar.\n\nCook-Shoot-Enjoy-Repeat!",

You can use canned pumpkin or fresh pumpkin puree, your own pumpkin spice, or a mix and you can include or exclude whatever you want from the icing!\n\nYield: 12 Rolls\n\nIf you'd like to see any part of this process, I've made a video, divided by chapters and you can click [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/COqDYsxOpHw) to go directly to it.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nDough:\n\n* 350g all-purpose flour\n* 200g pumpkin puree\n* 60g warm water\n* 60g warm 2% milk\n* 3 tbsp butter\n* 2 1\/4 tsp (1 pkg) dry active yeast\n* 1\/4 cup brown sugar\n* 1\/2 tsp salt\n\nPumpkin Pie Spice:\n\n* 1\/2 tsp cloves\n* 1 tsp allspice\n* 3\/4 tsp nutmeg\n* 1\/2 tsp ginger\n* 1 tbsp cinnamon\n\nFilling:\n\n* 1\/4 cup margarine (or butter, but I always forget to leave extra out)\n* 1\/2 cup brown sugar\n* 1 recipe \\^\\^\\^ of pumpkin pie spice (roughly 2 tbsp)\n\nMaple Cardamom Icing:\n\n* 4 oz. warm cream cheese\n* 1\/4 cup 2% milk\n* 60g maple syrup\n* 1\/4 tsp cardamom seed, ground\n* 2 tbsp icing sugar\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. Mix together water, milk, yeast and 1 tbsp brown sugar.\n2. When yeast is nice and foamy, add in all remaining dough ingredients except for 175g (or half) of flour and use a wooden spoon or paddle attachment to mix until combined.\n3. Add remaining flour and knead in stand mixer on medium-high for about 5-6 minutes.\n4. When dough is smooth and elastic, set aside in greased bowl to rise until doubled in size, approximately 1 hour.\n5. While the dough is resting, you can make the spice mixture and icing by just combining the ingredients listed.\n6. When dough has doubled in size, flour the top lightly, press out majority of the gas, and flip out onto a generously floured table.\n7. Roll dough into a rectangle roughly 1\/8 inch thick. You can either flour the top of the dough lightly or a rolling pin for this. I floured my dough.\n8. Brush rolled out dough with 1\/4 cup of margarine or soft butter, (I used margarine because my memory is similar to that of a goldfish and it's spreadable straight from the fridge) then evenly spread brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice overtop of the margarine.\n9. Starting with one of the long sides, gently roll the dough up tightly, trying to avoid large gaps or air bubbles that may make the rolls fall apart.\n10. Cut the resulting log into 12 equal pieces and set them cut sides down in a 9 inch oven-safe pan, covered, for 45 minutes to proof.\n11. Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 20-25 minutes, until nicely browned and cooked through.\n12. Top with icing if desired.",

However pectin makes the it really easy to make any sort of jams, so i highly recommend to buy it from the store.\n\n\r  \n\\- You can make dehydrated\/candied Orange slices by placing slices into the oven for around 2-4 hours at around 100\u00b0C. Lovely for decoration.\n\n\r  \n\\- You can definitely use a normal baking pan for this recipe. However, the perforated ring helps to make it look super professional. If you plan on using a normal baking pan, I suggest the blind bake method\r  \n\n---\n\r  \nIngredients &amp; Recipe\r  \n. \n\nTart Crust:\r  \n\\-  Room Temp Butter 100g\r  \n\\- Powdered Sugar 72g\r  \n\\- Almond Powder \/ Meal 20g\r  \n\\- Cornstarch 30g\r  \n\\- Eggs 36g\r  \n\\- Cake Flour 170g\r  \n\\- Salt\n\n\/1. Cream Butter slightly, Add Salt\n\n\/2. Sift in Powdered Sugar, Almond Meal, Cornstarch and mix until combined\n\n\/3. Mix in room temp eggs little by little until fully combined\n\n\/4. Sift in Cake Flour and mix until barely just combined\n\n\/5. Knead it by scrapping the dough against a rolling mat, until fully homogenous\n\n\/6. Place it between two sheets of parchment and roll to about \\~3mm thickness\n\n\/7. Place in the fridge minimum 2 hours (better overnight)\n\n\/8. Get your perforated ring mold and grease it fully\n\n\/9. Cut the dough with the ring (it will stick to the bottom of the ring, move quickly though since it melts very fast) and place it on a silicon baking mat\n\n\/10. Cut strips according to the circumference of the ring and quickly place it in the edges of the ring, connecting any broken\/short pieces with more strips (glue it with your hand, the heat will help combine two strips together)\n\n\/11. Freeze for 20 min until rock hard\n\n\/12. Bake at 170C for 15-20 minutes (check for colour)\n\n\/13. Wait for it to cool and take it out of the ring\n\n. \r\n\nAlmond Cream:\r  \n\\- Butter 56g\r  \n\\- Powdered Sugar 56g\r  \n\\- Almond Powder \/ Meal 56g\r  \n\\- Eggs 50g\r  \n\\- Rum Essence 1 tsp\n\n\r  \n\/1. Cream room temp butter\n\n\/2. Sift in Almond Meal and Powdered Sugar, mix thoroughly\n\n\/3. Add room temp eggs little by little and mix thoroughly\n\n\/4. Add Rum Essence and mix\n\n\/5 Place in fridge overnight\n\n. \n\nOrange Jam:\r  \n\\- Orange 200g\r  \n\\- Sugar 20g + 30g\r  \n\\- Pectin 4g\r  \n\\- Half a Lime, squeezed\n\n\u200b\n\n\/1. Blitz Orange and 20g Sugar\n\n\/2. Place on heat until slightly warm\n\n\/3. Add Pectin and 30g Sugar TOGETHER (mix it beforehand)\n\n\/4. Let it go until running boil and then add Lime Juice\n\n\/5 Mix thoroughly and place in fridge to set completely (few hours maybe overnight is better)\n\n\u200b\n. \n\nAssembly:\n\n\/1. Brush Egg Wash (1 part Egg Yolk and 4 parts Cream) all over the tart crust\n\n\/2. Fill the crust with Almond Cream until 70% of the way \n\n\/3. Bake 160C for 10-14 minutes \n\n\/4. Let it cool and fill the gaps with the orange jam.\n\n\/5 Decorate as you wish but my preference is to used canned orange slices (the ones doused in syrup) after draining it.\n\n\u200b\n\nENJOY",

Let them sit for 5 minutes.\n\nSift flours, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Rub the butter quickly and lightly into flour with fingers until the consistency of bread crumbs. \n\nDrain dates  and discard the liquid. Mix in dates using fingers\n\nBeat egg, vanilla and almond milk together in a small town. Gradually pour egg mixture into the flour mixture a bit at  time. Dough should be wet and sticky but still hold form. Set aside extra egg mixture. \n\nDust contour with flour and flatten dough using hands into a rectangle about 2.5cm\/1in thick and 6cm\/2.5in wide. \n\nFor American-style scones, cut the dough in quarters, and then on a reverse diagonal, cut into eights. Pick up each one, and quickly dust each side so scone is completely dusted. \n\nPut scones on baking sheet spaced at least 2.5cm\/1in apart, as thy will spread when baked. Quickly brush the scones with the remaining egg mixture. \n\nBake 14-20 minutes in the preheated open until rise and golden. Dust with powdered monk fruit sweetener with a sifter or eat as is or with butter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think they turned out good. Tho, I would put less dates in it if I make date scones again. Maybe 100 grams instead.",

Then add enough coffee to fill the rest of the cup. Make sure to leave room for whipped cream!  \n\n\n  \nUsually I like to whip my own (whip a cup of heavy cream with 2 tbsp sugar and 1\/2 tsp vanilla extract. When soft peaks form, add a shot of Bailey\u2019s and whip a few seconds longer for Bailey\u2019s whipped cream) but after I shaved down a chocolate bar, I wasn\u2019t feeling like the extra step so I used canned whipped cream. *One thing I have noticed about canned vs. fresh is that the canned stuff melts very quickly into the drink whereas fresh whipped cream will hold throughout the drink so you'll still have some left to slurp up at the end. Yum! So while I didn't follow my own advice for this picture, I do recommend taking the extra time to make your own.*  \n\n\n  \nTop with chocolate shavings and enjoy!",

Place the shrimp in a bowl and season with sumac, Aleppo pepper, salt, and pepper. Add half the lemon juice and all of the lemon zest. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.\n\n**Make the sauce:**\n\n1. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the butter. Add the shallot once the butter is melted and cook for 3\u20135 minutes until soft.\n2. Add the garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper. (Note: I like it spicy, so I add a good amount of crushed red pepper; add as much as you like, and you can always add more later!) Cook for 45 seconds until fragrant.\n3. Add the tomato paste to the pot and mash it into the aromatics for 2\u20133 minutes until it deepens in color and sticks to the bottom.\n4. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, add 1 teaspoon brown sugar, and simmer for 30 minutes until reduced by half. Add more water if the liquid evaporates too quickly. After simmering, taste the sauce and add the remaining 1 teaspoon brown sugar if needed. Add salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.\n\n**Cook the pasta:**\n\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a generous pinch of salt. Once boiling, add the linguine and cook until al dente. Reserve \u00bd cup pasta water and then drain the linguine and set aside.\n\n**Finish the sauce:**\n\n1. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings once more. Add half the pasta water and bring to a boil. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and minced parsley and stir until the cheese melts into the sauce.\n2. Reduce the heat to medium and add the shrimp and the remaining lemon juice to the sauce. Cook for 5\u20138 minutes until almost opaque.\n3. Add the linguine to the sauce and toss to coat, adding the remaining pasta water only as needed to loosen up the sauce. Once the shrimp are completely opaque, turn off the heat and transfer to a serving platter.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Garnish the pasta with a pinch of freshly grated Parmesan and more minced parsley if you like. Serve and enjoy!",

        "ingredient_comment":"Grating tomatoes is one of the BEST ways to use up those over-ripe tomatoes. I love it because it's no-mess...you don't have to dice them or blanch them and you won't have skins in the sauce.\n\nYou just grate on the large holes of a box grater and you can whizz through a bunch of tomatoes in like 5 mins. You want to use juicy, super ripe tomatoes...avoid Roma tomatoes as they are too dry\/firm.\n\nI use this process for homemade salsa because honestly, i just hate chopping up tomatoes (I have slight eczema on my fingers and the acidity of tomatoes really effs up my fingers) so grating is a really nice way to prep them for me!\n\nJust be mindful that there's a LOT of water in the grated tomatoes so you want to cook it off. I don't like straining them because I like cooking down the liquid; I think it makes a more flavorful sauce.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1\u00bd pounds large, ripe tomatoes (or use 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes)\n* 1 pound hot Italian sausage\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* 2 small zucchini, trimmed and diced\n* Crushed red pepper to taste\n* Pinch of sugar optional\n* 16 ounces rigatoni\n* 5 ounces baby spinach\n* 1 lemon, juiced\n* \u00bd cup Parmesan, finely grated; a pinch reserved for garnish\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Prep the tomatoes:**\n\n1. Cut off a very thin slice from the bottom of the tomatoes.\n2. Grate the tomatoes into a large bowl using the large holes of a box grater. Discard the skins.\n\n**Cook the sausage:**\n\n1. Heat a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the sausage and cook, breaking it up periodically, for 12\u201315 minutes until cooked through. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and drain off all but a teaspoon of the oil in the pot.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the onion. Cook for 5\u20137 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and zucchini and fry for 1\u20132 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper to taste.\n2. Return the sausage to the pot and pour in the grated tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20\u201330 minutes or until the sauce is thick. Stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from sticking. The grated tomatoes make quite a bit of excess water, so you want to cook it all off!  Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Boil the pasta:**\n\n1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add a generous amount of salt and the rigatoni. Cook until 1-2 minutes under al dente. Scoop out 1\/2 cup pasta water and drain the pasta.\n\n**Finish the pasta:**\n\n1. Taste the sauce and season once more. Add the baby spinach, lemon juice, and cooked pasta. Toss to coat for 2\u20133 minutes until the spinach is wilted. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and toss to coat for 1 minute more. Add pasta water if needed to loosen up the sauce and coat the pasta. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the pasta between shallow bowls. Sprinkle more Parmesan on each plate. Enjoy!",

I wanted to make skillet lasagna but didn't realize that that was a class of recipes that mostly involved chopping up some cooked pasta, tossing it with sauce, and finishing with cheese. instead, this is literally lasagna in a skillet.\n\nI do like that if you use no-boil pasta sheets, everything can be done in one skillet (I used an 11-inch skillet), and I like that it gives ya a bigger ratio of crispy pasta edges than with baking-tray lasagna. I will definitely be making this kind of lasagna again in the future! If you have questions about how I layered it, let me know. It was kind of hard to explain in the recipe",

My sun-dried tomatoes are preserved with garlic, but you can add minced garlic to the sauce. Or you can saut\u00e9 a diced onion or shallot prior to adding the sun-dried tomatoes to the pot.\n\nIf you're not vegan, a splash of cream to finish the sauce would be delicious too. And if you want a bit of protein, some diced grilled chicken would be great in this.\n\nSpinach would also be a great addition. Add it to the sauce before stirring in the pasta.\n\n**INGREDIENTS:**\n\n* 1\/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, diced\n* 1 tablespoon of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes\n* 4 ears of sweet corn, husked and cut from the cob\n* 1 cup water or vegetable stock\n* 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved\n* 1 ounce fresh basil, thinly sliced, a few leaves left whole and reserved for garnish\n* 16 ounces dry rigatoni or orecchiette\n* Extra virgin olive oil for garnish\n* Salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste\n\n**METHOD:**\n\n**Cook the tomatoes:**\n\n* Add 1 tablespoon of oil from the jar of sun-dried tomatoes to a wide pot. Turn the heat to medium.\n* Once hot, add the diced sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes until softened. Add the corn and cook an additional 3\u20135 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.\n\n**Simmer the sauce:**\n\n* Pour in the water or vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Add the halved cherry tomatoes and reduce heat and simmer for 15\u201320 minutes. The liquid should reduce by half. Taste and season once more to your preferences.\n* Finish the sauce by adding the sliced basil. Toss to combine.\n\n**Cook the pasta:**\n\n* As the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Cook the rigatoni until al dente. Reserve 1\/2 cup of the pasta cooking water and then drain the pasta.\n* Add the pasta cooking water to the sauce and bring it to a boil. Add the pasta and reduce heat to low. Toss to coat for 1\u20132 minutes until glossy. Turn off the heat and season one final time to your preferences.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n* Divide the cooked pasta between bowls. Garnish with a few basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, if you like. Enjoy!",

Get the delicious homemade filling without the hassle of making fresh pasta!\n\nThis is one of my favorite freezer meals to make, it\u2019s so easy to pull these out for a quick lunch or dinner. They use premade dumpling wrappers to skip the process of forming the ravioli from scratch (which has its place, but for me that\u2019s much less often)! For a quick lunch I will just serve them tossed in olive oil, but if I\u2019m pulling them out for dinner I like to dress them up with browned butter and fresh thyme as pictured.\n\nYou can also use this as a filling in standard ravioli with the dough made from scratch and it\u2019s delicious, or apply this trick with your favorite ravioli filling. The result is a thinner pasta than a traditional ravioli but still a delicious meal.\n\n# Shortcut Pumpkin Ravioli\n\n**Makes:  50 rav, 6 servings  (\\~8 rav per serving)**\n\n# Ingredients\n\n**For batch prep:**\n\n* 2  15 oz cans of unflavored pumpkin puree\n* 1 pack of 50 dumpling\/potsticker wrappers\n* 1 tbsp freshly minced garlic\n* 1 cup freshly grated parmesan (see note)\n* 4 tbsp butter\n* 3 tbsp light brown sugar\n* \u00bc tsp ground nutmeg\n* Salt\n\n**To prepare each serving (see",

Caramelize the onion and fennel: Heat avocado oil in a wide pot over medium-low heat. Add the onions and fennel and cook, stirring regularly, for 30-35 minutes until the onions and fennel deepen in color. Season with salt and pepper. You can add a little sugar, if you like them a bit sweeter.\n2. Crisp the sage: Heat 1\/4 cup extra virgin olive oil in a small pot over medium heat. Add half the sage leaves, in batches, and cook for 2-3 seconds until crispy. Immediately transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season  with salt. Reserve the oil.\n3. Mince the remaining half of the sage and set aside.\n4. Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta til al dente. Reserve 3\/4 cup pasta water. Drain pasta. *Note: try to time this so that you're draining the pasta right as the onions finish caramelizing.*\n5. Make the whipped ricotta: Combine the ricotta with lemon juice and zest and season with salt. Using a hand mixer, blend until very  smooth and creamy. If needed, add a splash or two of milk. Pour in half the reserved sage oil and continue blending until creamy. Set aside.\n6. Finish the pistachios: Crush all but 4 of the crispy sage leaves and toss with the pistachios. Season with salt and set aside.\n7. Finish the pasta: Melt the butter into the caramelized onions. Add the minced sage and cook 1 minute. add 1\/2 cup reserved pasta cooking water and bring to a boil. Cook for 3-4 minutes until thickened and reduced slightly. If needed, add more water. Add the pasta and toss to coat. Turn off the heat.\n8. To Serve: Divide the whipped ricotta between plates and add a touch more of the reserved sage oil on top. Pile the pasta on top and garnish with the pistachios. Place a crispy sage leave on top. Enjoy!",

Add 360 g of pasta and cook until al dente (check the package for cooking times).\n* Drain the pasta and now season it with the tomato sauce and give it a generous sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, mix well.\n* Now on each portion you can add a little bit of fried eggplant that you have left aside and with another sprinkling of parmigiano and salted ricotta cheese ( if you have it available )\n\nThat's all! if you have any question feel free to ask \\^\\_\\^",

        "ingredient_comment":"Tortellini is the most famous italian stuffed pasta and this is the classic recipe to do them at home. The ingredients are simple and genuine, the making of tortellini requires a little time and commitment but the taste worth the effort without doubt.\n\nFun fact: Legend claims that Tortellini was inspired by the goddess Venus' navel. One evening after a day of battle between Bologna and Modena, Venus, Bacchus and Mars found refreshment at the inn Corona in Castelfranco Emilia. The next morning Mars and Bacchus moved away from the inn leaving Venus dormant;\n\nWhen she woke up, she called the other companions to hear where they were. the innkeeper came to see if he could help and saw the little-dressed goddess was so impressed by its splendid shapes that he returned to the kitchen and created a pasta inspired by Venus' navel\u2026and so was born the Tortellini.\n\nAs usual if you like the recipe and want to subscribe you are welcome\n\nVideo recipe [HERE](https:\/\/youtu.be\/pM37CxZdXhk)\n\nServing for about 6 persons\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\nFor the filling\n\n* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) pork loin\n* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) mortadella\n* 100 gr ( 3.53 ounce ) cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )\n* 150 gr ( 5.29 ounce ) grated parmigiano\n* 10 gr ( 0.35 ounce )  butter\n* 2 eggs\n* nutmeg\n* black pepper\n* salt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the dough\n\n* 320 gr ( 11.29 ounce ) all-purpose  flour\n* 80 gr ( 2.82 ounce ) semolina flour\n* 4 eggs\n* 25 gr ( 0.88 ounce ) extra virgin olive oil\n* salt\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**INSTRUCTION**\n\n* in a pan put 10 gr butter and 100 gr pork loin diced\n* let the pork loin brown well and drain from the excess of butter\n* in a meat grinder put the pork loin, 100 gr mortadella and 100 gr cured ham ( prosciutto dolce if possible )\n* add to the mixture half nutmeg grated, 150 gr grated parmigiano, black pepper and 2 eggs\n* Mix well the mixture and add salt if needed ( you should taste the mixture because the flavor can vary depending on the type of cured ham and mortadella)\n* cover with a plastic wrap and let it rest for 2 hours\n\nNow let's prepare the homemade pasta as usual so 1 egg every 100 gr flours. For the flours we will use all-purpose and semolina flour in a proportion 4 to 1 so for this filling about 320 gr all-purpose and 80 gr semolina flour\n\n* Put the flours on a pastry board making a hole in the center where you will put 4 whole eggs and 25 gr extra virgin olive oil.\n* With a fork amalgamate the eggs and let the flour be incorporated, salt the dough and continue this operation until it will be possible to work it by hand.\n* work the dough until it is smooth and even. Leave it to rest in a film in the fridge for 30 minutes at least.\n* work the dough with a rolling pin and divide in several part\n* now with the help of a pasta machine begin to lower the thickness of the dough\n* the dough will be ready when it is less of one millimetre thick. I usually use the lower setting of thickness\n* now cut the pasta dough to obtain squares 4 cm long, i use a pasta cutter to obtain several squares at the time and speed up the process\n* Take a pasta square and put a little of filling in the middle then fold the square into a triangle. Finally, roll up the triangle and join the angles creating the typical shape of the tortellini like you can see in the video\n* if the pasta dries too much you can moisten the edges of the dough square with a finger wetted in a little water. this will help to seal the tortellini.\n* Put the tortellini on a tray lined with parchment paper. If you want you can also frozen tortellini, to do so put the tray in freezer a few hours, in this way they will remain intact and will not stick during freezing, when the tortellini are well frozen you can transfer them in bags to save space in the freezer\n* Cook tortellini into boiling beef and poultry stock. If frozen, do not unfreeze.\n* You can also prepare tortellini without broth. Cook them in abundant salted water, when they are ready ( 4\/5 minutes usually) drain them and season with a heavy cream sauce with ham and peas. If you want more precise instruction for this kind of seasoning ask in the comment section\n\nThat's all if you have any question feel free to ask and Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas  in advance \\^\\_\\^",

In this way you don't have to do a too liquid bechamel\n\nFor a baking dish 22 x 31 cm you will need about 450 gr lasagna sheet, 900 gr bolognese sauce and 700 gr bechamel sauce\n\nFor a baking dish 22 x 16 cm instead about 300 gr lasagna sheet, 500 gr bolognese and 400 gr bechamel\n\n* Cook the lasagna in oven for 30 minutes at 190\u00b0 and let it cool a bit before serving\n\nThat's all!  if you have any question feel free to ask \\^\\_\\^",

Heat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the ground chicken and cook for 5 minutes. Season with garlic powder, thyme, paprika, a big pinch of crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper. Continue saut\u00e9ing, breaking up the chicken as it cooks, for 10 minutes until it is cooked through.\n2. Transfer to a bowl.\n\n**Cook the vegetables:**\n\n1. Add another teaspoon of olive oil over medium heat if the pot seems dry. Add the mushrooms, onion, and celery. Saut\u00e9 for 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Simmer the soup:**\n\n1. Return the chicken to the pot. Add the diced tomatoes, 6 cups water, sugar, and balsamic vinegar. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Taste and adjust the seasonings.\n\n**Cook the orzo:**\n\n1. Return the soup to a boil. Add the orzo and cook for 7\u20138 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking. See note.\n\n**Finish the soup:**\n\n1. Once the orzo is mostly tender, reduce the heat to low. Add the baby spinach and parsley. Simmer for 4\u20135 minutes until the orzo is tender. Taste and season.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish each bowl with more parsley and a handful of mozzarella on top. Enjoy!\n\n**Notes**\n\n*If you want to avoid pasta swelling in the soup, cook the orzo separately. Serve only what you intend to eat with the soup and store the orzo separately in the refrigerator. You may wish to drizzle it with a touch of extra virgin olive oil before refrigerating to prevent it from sticking.*",

It\u2019s okay if you have a little more or a little less.\n4. Strain the broth through a fine mesh sieve into a large bowl. Discard solids. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.\n\n**Prepare the chicken and garlic:**\n\n1. Carefully pick the chicken from the bones. Shred the chicken and set it aside. You can freeze the bones for stock if you like. You can fry the chicken skin for a crunchy garnish or discard it.\n2. Pop the garlic cloves from the paper and mash them into a paste with a fork. Set aside.\n\n**Make the stew:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the pot over medium heat. Add the leek, celery, fennel, carrots, and saut\u00e9 for 10\u201315 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed to prevent them from burning. Season with salt and pepper.\n2. Add the dry thyme, garlic paste, and yellow split peas to the pot. Toss to coat and cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt.\n\n**Simmer the stew:**\n\n1. Pour in 4 cups of broth and shredded chicken. See note.\n2. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer uncovered for 30\u201345 minutes or until the yellow split peas are very tender. Cook for 30 minutes if you prefer a firmer split pea; longer if you prefer a creamier texture. Stir occasionally and gently mash the split peas, adding more water if the broth evaporates too quickly. Taste and add salt and pepper.\n\n**Finish the stew:**\n\n1. Once the stew is thick and creamy, stir in half the minced scallions and the lemon juice. Simmer for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the stew into bowls. Garnish with the remaining scallions. Enjoy!\n\n***Note:*** \n\n*If you have less than 4 cups of broth, add more water to supplement. If you have more, start with 4 cups of broth and add the remaining as needed. You can also add all the broth and simply simmer it a little longer.*",

Warm the stock in a microwave or in a small pot on the stove. Turn heat to low and keep warm. Preheat oven to 425\u00baF.\n\n**Start the Risotto:**\n\n1. Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 2-3 minutes until it just begins to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook for 12-13 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are golden brown. \n2. They should release all their liquid, and the liquid should evaporate from the pan. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n**Cook the Chicken:**\n\n1. As the mushrooms are cooking, start the chicken. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat neutral cooking oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook without moving for 5 minutes until the skin is very crispy and browned. Flip the chicken and transfer to the oven for 20-25 minutes until completely cooked through. Turn off the oven and keep the chicken in the oven as you finish the risotto to keep it warm.\n\n**Cook the Rice:**\n\n1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the rice. Cook, stirring regularly, for 2-3 minutes until the rice is coated with butter and begins to turn golden brown.\n2. Add the aji amarillo paste and toss to coat.\n3. Pour in the white wine and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low.\n4. Once the wine has been absorbed, add 1 cup of the stock and stir regularly until absorbed. Continue on, adding a cup of stock, stirring until absorbed, and then adding more stock until all of the stock has been incorporated, about 20-25 minutes total. Taste and season to your preferences. Turn off the heat and allow the risotto to rest for 5 minutes before serving.\n\n**To Serve:**\n\n1. Divide the risotto between shallow bowls and serve with a chicken thigh on top. Garnish with parsley, if desired.

In a bowl, whisk together the cream and egg until smooth.\n2. Add \u00bd cup panko, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, a big pinch of crushed red pepper, and the Parmesan cheese. Mix until combined and add a pinch of salt and pepper.\n3. Add the turkey to the bowl and season with salt and pepper. Use your hands to mix until combined, adding more panko as needed. The mixture should hold together but still be moist and not too firm.\n4. Heat the olive oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add a tiny drop of the meatball mixture and fry until cooked through. Taste and adjust the seasonings. Reduce the heat on the pot to low while you roll the meatballs.\n5. Roll the mixture into 2-inch balls; you should have about 12 meatballs. If you prefer smaller meatballs, roll them into tablespoon-sized balls, and you should have about 20 meatballs.\n\n**Fry the meatballs:**\n\n1. Return the heat on the pot to medium. Add the meatballs in an even layer and cook without moving for 3\u20134 minutes per side until browned all over. Depending on the size of your pot, you may need to cook them in batches. Transfer the meatballs to a plate. They need not be cooked through at this stage.\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. If the pot is dry, add another teaspoon or two of oil and turn the heat to medium heat. Once hot, add the sliced mushrooms and diced onion and cook for 10 minutes until softened. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste.\n2. Pour in the water or broth and scrape up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and add the tomatoes and salt and a pinch of sugar. Bring the tomatoes to a boil and add the meatballs. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.\n3. Remove the lid and check the temperature of the meatballs. Once they reach 165\u00baF, transfer them to a plate and scatter 5 fresh basil leaves on top of the meatballs along with a pinch more Parmesan cheese.\n\n**Finish the sauce:**\n\n1. Tear the remaining basil leaves and add them to the sauce with the cooked pasta and toss to coat. Taste and season.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Serve the sauced pasta at the table with the platter of turkey meatballs. Enjoy!",

        "ingredient_comment":"**Recipe here originally:** [**Rotisserie Chicken Tacos**](https:\/\/www.triedandtruerecipe.com\/rotisserie-chicken-tacos\/)\n\nI use a rotisserie chicken to make the tacos, and it's so good and a little less fussy than starting with raw on a weeknight. I also make use of leftover baked potatoes which work perfectly as a quick side dish. You can always use raw potatoes instead, but you'll just need to increase the roasting time!\n\nYou don't have to go so ham with all the sides and sauces like I did, but I didn't find this too labor-intensive because so many of the ingredients repeat across the sides. I also use bagged shredded cabbage for the slaw to save time :)\n\n**Chicken:**\n\n* 1 teaspoon neutral oil\n* 1 plain rotisserie chicken, meat picked from the bones and torn into bite-sized pieces; make sure you save the carcass for stock!\n* \u00bd small red onion, peeled and sliced; you\u2019ll use the other half in the slaw!\n* 1 tablespoon chili powder\n* 1 tablespoon cumin powder\n* 1 teaspoon paprika\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* \u00bd cup salsa verde or your favorite tomato salsa\n* \u00bc cup water, plus more as needed\n* Salt, if needed\n\n**Potatoes:**\n\n* 2 leftover baked potatoes, cut into cubes\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 2 teaspoons chili powder\n* 2 teaspoons cumin powder\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* \u00bc teaspoon cayenne powder\n* 1 lime, optional\n\n**Slaw:**\n\n* 10 ounces shredded red cabbage\n* 1 English cucumber, thinly sliced\n* 1 small jalape\u00f1o, peeled and minced\n* \u2153 cup loosely packed cilantro, minced\n* \u00bd small red onion, peeled and thinly sliced\n* 4 tablespoons mayonnaise\n* 1 grapefruit, juiced\n* 2 teaspoons sugar, plus more to taste\n* 1 teaspoon chili powder\n* Salt to taste\n\n**Avocado sauce:**\n\n* 1 large avocado, peeled and pitted\n* \u2153 cup sour cream\n* 1\u20132 limes, juiced; use 1 lime if you don\u2019t want it so tangy!\n* \u00bd cup loosely packed cilantro\n* 1\u20132 tablespoons water, plus more as needed\n* Salt\n\n**For serving:**\n\n* 12 small flour or corn tortillas\n\n**Make the chicken:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00baF.\n2. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and red onion and cook for 2\u20133 minutes. Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, and garlic powder, and cook for 2 minutes until fragrant.\n3. Pour in the salsa and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer as you prepare the rest of the recipe. Taste and add salt, if needed. Add more water as needed if the chicken begins to stick as it simmers.\n\n**Make the potatoes:**\n\n1. Toss the cubed potatoes on a baking sheet with the oil and spices. Season with salt and transfer to the oven for 15 minutes until they begin to crisp up around the edges. Remove from the oven and juice the lime over the potatoes if you like. Keep warm. *Note: If using raw potatoes, roast for 35\u201340 minutes instead.*\n\n**Make the slaw:**\n\n1. Gather the cabbage, cucumber, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, and red onion in a large bowl. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and set aside.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, grapefruit juice, sugar, chili powder, and a big pinch of salt. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.\n3. Pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Transfer to the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\n\n**Make the avocado sauce:**\n\n1. While the potatoes roast, make the slaw and transfer to the refrigerator\u2013ideally for 30 minutes\u2013but it\u2019s okay to enjoy it a little sooner :)\n2. Combine the avocado, sour cream, lime juice, and cilantro in a food processor and pulse until smooth. Add water, starting with 1\u20132 tablespoons\u2013and pulse until smooth. Add more water until the sauce reaches a drizzling consistency. Taste and add salt. Note: if you don\u2019t want to break out the food processor, you can mash the avocado and mince the cilantro. Simply mash all of the ingredients together with a fork until mostly smooth.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Warm up the tortillas and pile the chicken on each tortilla. Drizzle with the avocado sauce and add a spoonful of slaw on top. Serve with the warm potatoes on the side. Enjoy!",

If you prefer sweeter peppers, use red or orange bell peppers, or try it with one green and one red bell pepper for a mix. If you\u2019re not a fan of ground turkey, make this with pork or beef instead.\n\nCook time: 55 minutes | Serves: 5\n\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n* 1 pound ground turkey\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and small-diced\n* 1 green bell pepper, trimmed, seeded, and small-diced\n* \u00bc cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil, chopped\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, divided; plus more to taste\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* 1 teaspoon paprika\n* Crushed red pepper, to taste\n* \u00bc cup water\n* 14.5-ounce can fire-roasted crushed tomatoes\n* \u00bd cup finely grated Parmesan cheese, divided\n* 16 ounces mezzi rigatoni or another tubular pasta of choice\n* Fresh basil leaves, for serving\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**Cook the turkey:**\n\n1.

Add the diced onion, bell pepper, and sun-dried tomatoes and cook for 5\u20137 minutes until the onion and peppers soften. Season with salt.\n2. Melt the butter into the pot and add the remaining Italian seasoning along with the garlic powder, paprika, and crushed red pepper to taste. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n**Simmer the rag\u00f9:**\n\n1. Return the turkey to the pot and cook for 1\u20132 minutes.\n2. Pour in the water and crushed tomatoes and bring to a boil.

        "ingredient_comment":"**Recipe here originally: [Duck Dumplings](https:\/\/newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com\/p\/your-next-weekend-cooking-project)**\n\nI based this recipe off my duck egg roll recipe which I've made several times now, and it's always a huge hit. I made a few modifications to the filling based on ingredients I had readily available, but the filling is fantastic, with or without mushrooms.\n\nYou can also use a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store - just make sure you finely chop it.\n\n**Roast duck:**\n\n* 4\u20135\u00a0pound\u00a0duck; giblets, neck, and feet reserved for another use\n* 1 orange, quartered\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Filling:**\n\n* 2-inch\u00a0piece of ginger, peeled and minced\n* 4\u00a0cloves\u00a0garlic, peeled and minced\n* 3\u00a0scallions, trimmed and minced\n* 2\u00a0Thai chili peppers, trimmed and minced\n* 2\u00a0tablespoons hoisin sauce\n* 2\u00a0tablespoons thin\u00a0soy sauce\n* 1\u20132 tablespoons sweet chili sauce, optional, to taste\n* \u00bd orange, juiced\n* Salt, if needed\n\n**Dumplings:**\n\n* 24\u201328 dumpling wrappers\n* Sliced scallion greens, optional, for garnish\n* Water\n\n**Sauce:**\n\n* \u2153 cup black vinegar\n* 1\u20132 teaspoons chili oil\n* 1 teaspoon sesame oil\n* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds\n\n**Prepare the duck:**\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF.\n2. Line a roasting pan with foil. Place a raised rack in the pan and set aside.\n3. Pat the duck dry and season it all over with salt and pepper.\n4. Stuff the cavity with the orange wedges. Truss the legs with kitchen twine.\n\n**Roast the duck:**\n\n1. Place the duck on top of the raised rack and transfer it to the oven for 2 hours.\n2. Remove the duck from the oven. Using a sharp knife, create a few shallow slits in the skin across the breast and around the thighs. This will allow the fat to fully render. Be careful not to cut the meat too much. You just need 6\u20138 slits all over the duck, particularly around the fatty area of the legs and breasts.\n3. Return the duck to the oven for 1 hour.\n4. Remove the duck from the oven and let cool as you prepare the filling.\n\n**Prepare the filling:**\n\n1. Gather the minced ginger, garlic, scallions, and Thai chili peppers in a bowl. Add the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, orange juice, and sweet chili sauce if you like.\n\n**Shred the duck:**\n\n1. Once the duck is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones. Avoid any meat that feels very sinewy. You can keep as much of the crispy skin as you like for the dumplings, particularly the skin around the breasts, thighs, and legs. I discard the skin on the back of the duck. Reserve the carcass for stock, if you like.\n2. Place the meat and skin on a cutting board and finely dice. Transfer to the bowl of aromatics and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Your filling is finished, and you're ready to make dumplings!\n\n**Fold the dumplings:**\n\n1. First, get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation.\n2. Place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the middle of the dumpling wrapper.\n3. Wet the edges with water and fold the dumpling in half. Pinch the edges to seal the dumpling closed into a half-moon shape.\n4. You can crimp and pinch the edges as you seal it, but it takes practice!\n\n**Steam, pan-fry, or deep fry the dumplings:**\n\n1. To steam: fill your steamer pot with water and place the rack on top. Place a liner on top. Bring the water to a boil and arrange the dumplings on top. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and steam for 10 minutes.\n2. To pan-fry: Dip the bottoms of the dumplings into the water just to coat the bottom, then dip into a bowl of sesame seeds to evenly coat the bottom. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high. Add the dumplings, sesame seed side down, and cook without moving for 1 minute. Pour in \u00bc cup water and cover immediately. Cook for 3\u20134 minutes.

Make the sauce by whisking together the black vinegar, chili oil, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. Place the sauce in a small bowl in the middle of a serving platter.

        "ingredient_comment":"**Recipe + more photos here originally:** [**My Favorite Duck Breast Recipe**](https:\/\/newsletter.triedandtruerecipe.com\/p\/my-favorite-duck-breast-recipe)\n\n**A quick tip:**\n\nTypically, you need to only boil pearl onions for 2 minutes. I go a little longer to soften them a bit more so I don't have to saut\u00e9 them quite as long since you're holding the duck. BUT! If you don't mind dirtying another skillet, feel free to start those mushrooms and onions in a separate skillet as you cook the duck.\n\nSeared duck breast:\n\n* 1 duck breast (1 pound)\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nMushrooms and pearl onions:\n\n* 8 ounces gold or white pearl onions\n* 12 ounces cremini mushrooms trimmed and thinly sliced\n* 2 tablespoons reserved duck fat\n* 3 sprigs thyme\n* 4 garlic cloves peeled and thinly sliced\n* 1 tablespoon freshly minced parsley, plus more for garnish\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nSweet potato puree:\n\n* 2 sweet potatoes, about 1 pound, peeled and cubed\n* 2 tablespoons butter\n* \u00bd cup whole milk plus more, if needed\n* 2 tablespoons sour cream\n* 2 teaspoons garlic powder\n* 2 teaspoons Aleppo pepper flakes or paprika and a pinch of crushed red pepper\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nParboil and peel the pearl onions:\n\n1. Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Add the pearl onions (skins on) and boil for 5 minutes. Transfer the onions to a bowl of ice-cold water using a slotted spoon.\n2. Once the onions are cool enough to handle, carefully cut off the root end of the onion with sharp scissors. Pop the onion out from its skin. Continue on until all the onions are peeled. Discard the skins.\n\nCook the sweet potatoes:\n\n1. Dump out the water from the pot and add the sweet potatoes. Cover with fresh water and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20 minutes until fork-tender.\n2. Turn off the heat. Pour the potatoes into a colander and return the pot to the same burner. Allow the potatoes to dry off for 1 minute using the residual heat from the warm burner.\n3. Add the butter, milk, sour cream, garlic powder, and pepper flakes to the potatoes.\n4. Using an immersion blender, blend until creamy and smooth, adding more milk if needed. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder or pepper flakes. Set aside and keep warm.\n\nCook the duck:\n\n1. Pat the duck dry breast dry. Using a sharp paring knife, score the skin at an angle in \u215b-inch increments until the skin has been completely scored from edge to edge. Be careful not to pierce or cut into the flesh of the duck.\n2. Place the duck, skin-side down, into a skillet. Turn the heat to medium and cook for 7 minutes or until the fat begins to render out. Adjust the heat periodically as it cooks. You want to stay somewhere between medium and medium-low.\n3. If your duck breast is unevenly fatty (for example, the ends may have a thicker fat layer than the middle of the breast), use a small cast-iron press or skillet or a metal flipper to press that part of the duck into the skillet to encourage even browning.\n4. After 7 minutes, get the heat back to medium or just slightly above. The fat in the skillet may begin bubbling and sputtering a bit more rapidly. Check the skin and continue frying and adjusting the heat until the skin is deep golden brown and crisp. This may take another 6\u20138 minutes. Just keep adjusting the heat and peeking at the skin.\n5. Flip the duck and turn the heat to medium. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until desired internal temperature is met. For medium-rare, cook the duck to about 130\u00baF at the thickest part of the breast. Note: Do not take the temperature of the duck through the skin. Pierce the flesh in order to get an accurate temperature read. I prefer to cook the duck until it reaches 135\u00baF.\n6. Transfer the duck to a plate and cover it tightly with foil. Set aside to rest as you finish the rest of the recipe.\n\nFry the mushrooms and onions:\n\n1. Drain all the duck fat into a heat-proof jar through a small sieve. Wipe out the skillet and place it on the stove over medium heat.\n2. Once hot, add the mushrooms and cook for 5 minutes until the mushrooms begin to sweat and take on a bit of color.\n3. Add 2 tablespoons of reserved duck fat, pearl onions, and thyme sprigs. Season with salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes until the pearl onions are fork-tender and golden around the edges.\n4. Stir in the minced garlic and fresh parsley and saut\u00e9 for 1 minute. Turn off the heat.\n\nTo serve:\n\n1. Right before serving, remove the foil from the duck and slice it crosswise.\n2. Spoon the sweet potatoes into a rimmed plate and pile on the mushrooms and onions. Arrange a few slices of duck on each plate. Garnish with more parsley and Aleppo pepper flakes if you like. Enjoy!",

Continue cooking for 10 minutes, and season to your taste with salt  if needed.\n\n**5.** When ready, serve the dish garnished with fresh coriander. You can enjoy it with cucumber raita, naan bread and basmati rice.\n\nOriginally posted: [Mango Butter Chicken](https:\/\/www.insightflavour.com\/post\/mango-butter-chicken-murg-makhani)",

You can also use cashews or almonds.\n\nDon't overcook the vegetables - To retain their texture and nutrients, don't overcook the vegetables. Add them towards the end of cooking and cook just until they're tender.\n\nAdjust the seasoning - Taste the curry as you cook it and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may need to add more salt, sugar, or fish sauce to balance the flavours.",

Preheat the oven to 350\u00baF.\n2. Line a roasting pan with foil. Place a raised rack in the pan and set aside.\n3. Pat the duck dry and season it all over with salt and pepper.\n4. Stuff the cavity with quartered clementines and shallots. Using kitchen twine, tie the legs together.\n\n**Roast the duck:**\n\n1. Place the duck on top of the raised rack and transfer it to the oven for 2 hours.\n2. Remove the duck from the oven. Using a sharp knife, create a few shallow slits in the skin across the breast and around the thighs. This will allow the fat to fully render. Be careful not to cut the meat too much. You just need 6\u20138 slits all over the duck, particularly around the fatty area of the legs and breasts.\n3. Return the duck to the oven for 1 hour.\n4. Remove the duck from the oven and let cool as you prepare the filling.\n\n**Cook the filling:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, minced shallot, ginger, garlic, scallions, and minced Thai chili peppers. Cook for 6\u20137 minutes, turning occasionally until the mushrooms are golden brown. Turn off the heat and transfer to a large bowl.\n\n**Prepare the filling:**\n\n1. To the bowl of aromatics, add the hoisin sauce, sweet chili sauce, soy sauce, Chinese Five Spice, and white pepper. Toss to combine. Set aside.\n\n**Shred the duck:**\n\n1. Once the duck is cool enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones. Avoid any meat that feels very sinewy. You can keep as much of the skin as you like for the egg rolls, particularly the skin around the breasts, thighs, and legs. I discard the skin on the back of the duck. Reserve the carcass for stock, if you like.\n2. Place the meat and skin on a cutting board and finely dice. Transfer to the bowl of aromatics and toss to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference.\n\n**Heat the oil:**\n\n1. Heat 2\u20133 inches of oil in a wide pot until it reaches 325\u00baF.\n\n**Roll the egg rolls:**\n\n1. First, get a small bowl of water and place it on your workstation.\n2. Place the egg roll wrapper on a plate and rotate it so that it\u2019s a diamond.\n3. Place two tablespoons or so of filling in the middle of the wrapper.\n4. Lift up the bottom corner of the diamond (the corner closest to you) and fold it over the filling. Use your fingers to pinch the wrapper over the filling tightly.\n5. Fold the left and right corners over the filling. The wrapper will look like an envelope now.\n6. Roll the mixture toward the top corner one rotation. You should have a small triangle sticking out at the top.\n7. Dip your fingers into the water and wet the edges of the remaining corner (imagine you\u2019re sealing an envelope!). Roll the filling one more rotation to seal the egg roll. Dip your fingers back into the water and brush the corner once more to completely seal the egg roll.\n8. Continue on until all the egg rolls are rolled.\\*\n\n**Fry the egg rolls:**\n\n1. Once the oil is hot, begin frying the egg rolls in batches for 2\u20134 minutes or until the wrapper is golden brown and crispy. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Place the egg rolls on a serving platter with thinly sliced scallions. Serve with your favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy!\n\n*Note: If you don\u2019t think you can eat all of them in one sitting, place as many un-fried egg rolls as you\u2019d like to freeze on a baking sheet. Transfer to the freezer for 4 hours. Remove from the freezer and place in a freezer bag. Return to the freezer. They will keep for up to 6 months and can be baked, deep-fried, or air-fried whenever you want them!*",

Before beginning, prepare all of the fresh ingredients and have them ready\n\n**Prepare the sauce:**\n\n1. Place all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl and whisk until the cornstarch is completely incorporated into the liquid and no lumps remain. Set aside.\n\n**Prepare the chicken:**\n\n1. Place a skillet on the stovetop over medium heat. Add the neutral oil and allow it to heat as you prepare the chicken.\n2. Put the diced chicken in a bowl and season it with salt and white pepper. Sprinkle the cornstarch on top and use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to mix until all the chicken is coated.\n3. Turn the heat on the skillet to medium-high. Once the oil is hot and shimmering in the skillet, arrange a batch of the chicken in an even layer, ensuring that the chicken isn\u2019t crowded. Cook for 4\u20136 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a bowl and continue cooking the chicken in batches until all of the chicken is fried.\n\n**Cook the mushrooms:**\n\n1. If the pot is dry, add 1 teaspoon neutral oil.

Transfer them to a plate but do not stack as they will stick together.\n\n**3.** Preheat the frying pan and add olive oil and butter. Once butter melts, pan-fry chicken breasts on medium-high heat until both sides are golden brown (I had to do it in three batches). When ready transfer the chicken onto a plate. Keep covered with another plate and set aside.\n\n**4.** Saut\u00e9 the diced garlic for a minute and add veg stock, give it a stir to remove any bits stuck to a pan. Next, add heavy cream and parmesan cheese. Simmer for 2 minutes then mix in 1tsp of tomato puree, season with oregano and chilli.\n\n**5.** Add chopped sun-dried tomatoes and the chicken, simmer for a few minutes or until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper to your taste.\n\n**6.** Garnish with semi-dried cherry tomatoes, fresh basil leaves and sprinkle with parmesan. Enjoy with pasta, rice or pearl barley.",

Try adding a soup green at the end (like escarole, spinach, or arugula) or you can add some frozen veggies at the end like green beans, corn, or peas!\n* **Barley:** Use wild rice, farro, farfalle, egg noodles, or pearl couscous.

Prepare chicken breast\n\nPaper dry chicken breast and slice horizontally from the thicker side to a thinner, but stop about 1\/2 inches to it. This way you will \"butterfly\" your chicken breast, which is a well-known technique to make thin and large chicken pieces. \n\nCover your butterflied chicken breast with a piece of plastic wrap and roll a pin over it to make it even and thinner. Set aside.\n\n2.  Make mushroom stuffing \n\nMince 5 cloves of garlic and saut\u00e9 it in a frying pan over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add finely chopped 2 onions, keep saut\u00e9ing for another 2 minutes. Add chopped Portobello mushroom caps to the pan and keep cooking stirring occasionally for 5 more minutes or until all water will evaporate from the pan. \n\nAdd a quarter of a cup of dry White Wine, mix well and cook until stuffing gets almost dry. \n\nAt that point add 1 teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of pepper, and some fresh minced thyme. Mix well and set aside to cool down.\n\n3. Roll!\n\nPlace your chicken with a wide side down and thin side up like on the pictures below. \nDivide mushroom sauce into 3 parts: 2 for each chicken breast and 1 for the cream sauce for later. \n\nUsing a spoon, evenly spread 1 part of mushroom stuffing over the chicken piece, leaving half an inch on each side uncovered. \n\nNext, lay some thinly sliced fresh mozzarella, keep sides uncovered.\n\nGently roll chicken working your way from the wider bottom to the thinner top. Do not add too much pressure, as your stuffing will try to escape! We will secure everything in place with a cooking twine in just a second.\n\nNow it is time to wrap our roulade in prosciutto. Here is what I learned the hard way ( meaning one of the roulades on final pictures is an unsuccessful test, but still the same delicious ha!): lay prosciutto slices parallel to your chicken roll, this way it is much easier to cover the whole roulade, which will look so much better when the dish is done!\n\nTwine up! Using a cooking twine (the cotton string will work just fine!) gently wrap your roulade, starting from one side of it with tying a knot and work your way to the other side. Now you can add some pressure to help twine keep roulade`s shape while searing it. \n\n4. Sear roulade \n\nPreheat your skillet pan on medium heat. I used skillet mostly because I  wanted to be able to cook my dish both on a stovetop and in the oven, so if you have a suitable frying pan you can stick it into your cooking stove, - use that! Also, I used 2 tablespoons of canola oil to season my pan. \n\nAdd your chicken roulades into a hot pan and sear for 3 minutes on each of 4 sides.  Let it cool down for 5 minutes before proceeding to the final step.\n\n5. Sauce and bake\n\nGently remove twine by cutting each layer and pulling it.\n\nFinally, pour half a cup of heavy cream into your pan, add a third of the mushroom stuffing left from making roulades, and a little bit more cheese ( at this point you can use any cheese you love but make sure it is great melting one). \n\nPlace pan into the preheated to 370F oven and bake for 20 minutes. \nTo add some amazing color broil on High for just a minute before taking it out of the oven.",

Fry the chicken strips in peanut oil or another good frying oil on medium heat for ~ 5 minutes on each side or until you see the sauce begin to caramelize on the chicken and it's cooked through.  Set your chicken aside and then, if necessary, add a little more oil to the pan and throw in all of your minced garlic.  Turn up the heat here to high and once the garlic starts to brown slightly, throw in all of your chopped-up veggies.  Fry the veggies until you see them start to brown and then turn down the heat to medium-low and throw in all of your sauces along with the chicken.  Throw in the corn starch, MSG, and sugar, give this a good mix, and cook on medium-low for a minute or two.  Finally, kill the heat or turn down to the lowest setting and add in the basil.  Stir the basil around until it gets all saucy and nice.  It's important not to really cook the basil but to let the very low or residual heat and sauce do their work on it while you mix it in.",

Slice the chicken breasts into 5-6 pieces each and the thighs into 3-4 pieces each. Place them in a marinating dish or large plastic zipper bag.\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together 1\/4 cup olive oil, the spices, 3\/4 tsp salt and 1\/4 tsp black pepper (if you are salt sensitive, use 1\/2 tsp of salt). Pour the spice marinade over the chicken pieces. Stir with a spoon till all the chicken pieces are evenly coated in the marinade.\n3. Cover the marinating dish with plastic wrap, or close the zipper bag. Place chicken in the refrigerator and let it marinate at least 1 hour, up to overnight.\n\n## Oven Cooking Method\n\n1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray the baking sheet with nonstick cooking oil. Place the chicken pieces on the sheet, evenly spaced.\n2. Place the chicken in the oven. Let it roast for about 15 minutes until cooked through, turning the chicken pieces once with tongs halfway through cooking.\n3. Take chicken out of the oven and let it cool slightly. Use a sharp knife to slice the meat into small, thin shawarma-like pieces.\n4. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a skillet on the stovetop over medium. Pour half of the chicken into the skillet and saute for 3-4 minutes till the smallest pieces of chicken turn brown and crisp. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste, if desired.\n5. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet. Heat another 1 tbsp of oil and saute the remaining chicken in the same way. Serve warm.\n\nEdit: Also thanks for giving me a lot of recipes to try out :)",

The word for chicken, g\u0101i in Cantonese and j\u012b in Mandarin, sounds like several words of good fortune.\n\nJust to name a few phrases that my parents shared with us:\n\n* h\u00f3u sai gaai \u597d\u4e16\u754c - A Cantonese phrase that roughly translates to good world, good life.\n* d\u00e0j\u00edd\u00e0l\u00ec \u5927\u5409\u5927\u5229 - A Mandarin phrase that roughly translates to great luck, great profit.\n* y\u00e1uh t\u00e0uh y\u00e1uh m\u00e9ih \u6709\u5934\u6709\u5c3e - A Cantonese phrase that literally translates to: \"has a head, has a tail.\" It means \"good beginning, good ending.\" This is one of the reasons why it's important to make a whole chicken for Lunar New Year.\n* j\u00e1au p\u00e0h j\u00e1au w\u00e0h \u6293\u6252\u6293\u93f5 - A Toisanese phrase, related to eating the chicken legs, that roughly means \"face all challenges with persistence.\"\n\nSo, basically, eat a whole chicken if you want to live. (jk)\n\n## The Recipe\n\nMain Ingredients\n\n* 4 lb **whole chicken** (traditionally for Lunar New Year, the chicken has its head &amp; feet intact)\n* 2 oz **green onion**\n* 1.5 oz **ginger**\n* 5 tbsp **corn oil**\n\nAdditional Flavor &amp; Seasoning\n\n* 1 tsp **salt** (for boiling water)\n* 2 tsp **salt** (for ginger scallion sauce)\n* 1 tbsp **sesame oil**\n\n# Step 1 - Boil water, add salt\n\nSet the stove to high heat and start boiling a generous amount of water in the pot you'll be using.\n\nWe'll want to be able to fully submerge our chicken in the water to make sure it cooks evenly.\n\nWe'll also be adding **1 teaspoon of salt**. My dad says not to add too much here.\n\n# Step 2 - Prepare &amp; cook chicken\n\n* Wait for the water to come to a boil.\n\nWe'll be doing a couple of things in this step, mostly to ensure that the entire chicken is cooked evenly for maximum tenderness.\n\n* **Pierce a hole in the skin in the neck -** This helps the water flow through the chicken cavity to help it cook more evenly.\n* **Stretch the legs away from the body several times -** This helps to avoid having a big clump of chicken meat that's undercooked.\n* **Slowly dip the chicken 3 times in the boiling water -** This helps even out the temperatures on the inside of the cavity and on the exterior of the chicken. Make sure the water is already boiling before you do this.\n* **Add the chicken and make sure it's completely submerged -** If you have to add more boiling water, do it.\n\nFrom here, we'll cover the pot.\n\nHere's a rough heat \/ timing overview:\n\n* Once the pot's been covered, leave it on high heat for 5 minutes as the water comes to a boil again.\n* Lower the heat to a simmer, and cook for another 35-40 minutes. The larger the chicken, the longer you cook it. The sweet spot is 4 pounds.\n* Check if it's done. If so, transfer it to an ice bath. (More on both of these later.)\n\n# Step 3 - Mince scallions and ginger\n\nWhile we wait for the chicken to cook, we'll start on our sauce by mincing our **green onions** (2 oz) and **ginger** (1.5 oz)\u200b.\n\nMy dad said the exact ratio and amounts don't matter too much. Most recipes I've seen use more scallions than ginger.\n\nHaving a surplus of sauce is a great problem to have, since you can use it on pretty much everything. (I LOVE dousing my rice and vegetables in this addictive sauce)\n\nFor the green onions, we'll be using the white stems (about 4 stems at the default serving size). Cut each stem in half, length-wise, and then into strips. Then, mince the strips into fine pieces.\n\nFor the ginger, we'll be cutting them into thin slices, strips, and then fine pieces.\n\nMy dad is using separate plates to hold the green onions and ginger. The ginger will be cooked first in the next step, so this makes it easier to separate.\n\nAlso, feel free to use a food processor here instead of mincing.\n\n# Step 4 - Heat oil, cook ginger scallions\n\nWe'll heat up our wok on high heat and add **corn oil** (5 tbsp).\n\nThe oil should be around 350-400F before we add the ginger.\n\nA good visual cue is to wait until the oil starts \"shimmering\", or forming ripples across the surface due to the heat.\n\nWhy do we do this? By cooking everything in oil, we unlock the aromatics of the ginger and green onion.\n\nOnce the oil is hot enough, add the ginger and cook for about 15 seconds before adding the green onions. Cook everything for another 20-30 seconds before transferring the sauce to a bowl.\n\n# Step 5 - Flavor the sauce\n\nWe'll add **salt** (2 tsp) and **sesame oil** (1 tbsp) to the bowl, and mix for 30-60 seconds.\n\nDo a taste test and adjust if necessary. My dad emphasized multiple times how important it is to add sesame oil here, so make sure you don't skip it.\n\n# Step 6 - Prepare an ice bath\n\nGrab a big bowl and dump a few handfuls of ice into it. Fill it roughly halfway with cold water.\n\nThe ice bath is very important - once the chicken is done cooking, we need to immediately cool it down.\n\nWhy is this so important?\n\n* **It helps the meat contract and locks the juices inside - I**f we skip this step, juices will flood out as we chop the chicken into pieces.\n* **It helps the skin stay attached -** Without this step, we'll have a bunch of loose pieces of skin everywhere.\n* **It gives the skin a bit more of a chewy texture**\n\n# Step 7 - Determine if the chicken is done\n\nOnce the time draws near, we can uncover the pot. Poke the thickest part of the chicken (around the thigh) deeply with a chopstick.\n\nIf blood or red fluid leaks out, we need to cook it for a few more minutes.\n\nIf the fluid is clear, it's ready for the ice bath.\n\nFeel free to use your newfound chicken broth however you'd like. In the video, my dad created two additional dishes (a soup and a veggie) out of it by boiling bok choy with some ginger.\n\n# Step 8 - Lift and transfer to ice bath\n\nCarefully take two chopsticks under the chicken wings, and lift it over the pot.\n\nSuspend it over the pot for 30-45 seconds to let some of the residual water drip out.\n\nThen, carefully transfer it into the ice bath. Prepare for a splash!\n\nLet the chicken sit in the bath for 5 minutes, occasionally pouring water over the surface of the chicken and rotating the chicken in the container.\n\n# Step 9 - Carve the chicken\n\n* This could honestly be its own post, but for now it will live in a very detailed step in this recipe.\n\nThis is a lot easier to follow in our YouTube video, where we dedicate about 6 minutes of time to this segment.\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind before you start.\n\n* My dad\u2019s done this hundreds of times, and it took him about 10 minutes from start to finish. It\u2019ll probably take a lot longer if you\u2019re a beginner like me, but the main thing is just to make sure your cleaver is sharp and that you\u2019re moving carefully and deliberately.\u00a0\n* If you don\u2019t already have a cleaver, it\u2019s still technically possible, but I highly recommend getting one if you plan on making this dish. Here are some options:\n   * Dexter Russell Heavy Duty Cleaver \n   * Saamhangnga Cleaver \n* For easier, safer cutting, you should use a larger, thicker cutting board that\u2019s preferably made of wood, and you should place a moist towel underneath it to increase its stability.\n\nHow to plate, according to Chinese tradition:\n\n* Basically everything is plated - even parts that aren't readily edible like the head.\n* Each piece of chicken is laid out on a large plate according to where it was on its body, head to toe, right to left.\n* You'll often see this served on a large oval-shaped plate.\n\nOrder of operations:\n\n* Cut off the neck and feet, cut into small pieces\n* Cut and place the head and butt at opposite ends of the middle axis of the plate\n* Remove the wings and thighs\n* Cut and split the torso into two halves (front and back)\n* Split the back in half, and cut it into pieces\n* Cut and pry away the breast bone, and cut it into pieces\n* Cut the thighs and wings into small pieces\n\nCutting techniques:\n\n* A technique my dad uses a lot involves making a shallow slice to wedge the cleaver, and then hitting down on the blade with our palm to drive the blade through the bone.\u00a0\n* In our recent knife skills interview, my dad talked about the 3 different parts of the blade - the root, the belly, and the tip. When chopping through bone, he always makes contact with the root, or the part of the blade closest to the handle.\u00a0\n\nWhen I first started this project, documenting how my dad carves a chicken was high on the list of traditions I wanted to learn and share. It always feels like I\u2019m watching an artist at work when I see my dad gracefully chop and plate everything.\u00a0\n\nEvery cut has an intention, and every piece has a place. Almost everything goes on the plate, and nothing is wasted. Especially for Lunar New Year and other celebrations, bak chit gai is meant to be one of the main decorative centerpieces on the dinner table, and carving it up into beautiful bite-sized pieces is an honor that I hope to take on one day for my own family.\u00a0\n\n-----\n\n# Our why\n\nI've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.\n\nThanks for reading! Hope you all love the recipes :)",

Welp, Vietnamese people eat FAR more than just pho or banh mi, and at home, food is oftentimes far simpler and humbler, like this simple preparation of Vietnamese garlicky roast chicken. \n\n  \nRoast chicken has thousands of iterations across cultures, but this is one of my absolute favorites, and it\u2019s sooo simple: it\u2019s got just six ingredients plus the chicken, and after 30 minutes roasting in the oven, you\u2019ve got a lip-smackingly luscious bird that will beg to have its juices sopped up with some rice!\n\n  \nTo watch my video on how to make this:\u00a0[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TpGAeZo3-90)  \n**Viet Garlicky Roast Chicken Recipe (adapted from Andrea Nguyen)**\u00a0\n\n  \n1 whole 3.5-4 lb chicken, preferably\u00a0organic and air-chilled,\u00a0spatchcocked (back bone removed with bird splayed flat), OR 3.5-4 lb chicken parts (thighs,\u00a0drumsticks, and wings)\u00a0\n\n  \n*Marinade ingredients:*\n\n* 4\u00a0whole garlic cloves,\u00a0minced finely\u00a0\n* 1 tsp black pepper\n* 1.5 tsp sugar\n* 1\/4 tsp kosher salt\n* 1.5 Tbsp\u00a0neutral oil\n* 3.5 Tbsp Maggi seasoning\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Combine all sauce\u00a0ingredients into a bowl and mix well.\u00a0\n2. Prepare\u00a0the chicken: take the chicken (or chicken parts), and using a chopstick or skewer, carefully\u00a0separate the skin from the meat all over. Then, add the marinade sauce all\u00a0over\u00a0the chicken with your hands, making sure to get the sauce\u00a0between the meat\u00a0and the skin.\u00a0\n3. Refrigerate the chicken\u00a0and\u00a0allow to marinade for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight for the best flavor\u00a0penetration.\u00a0\n4. The next day, preheat oven to 500 F. Place spatchcocked\u00a0chicken on a cast iron roasting pan or roasting tray.\u00a0Place\u00a0chicken in the oven and roast for about 30 minutes, checking about 5-10\u00a0min in to ensure the chicken isn\u2019t browning too quickly. If it is, tent the darker parts with foil and lower heat to 450 F. If using parts, roast time may be closer to 40-45 min.\u00a0\n5. After about 30 minutes, remove chicken from the oven. Check doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer - thighs should register about 165 F when done.\u00a0\n6. Once the chicken is done,\u00a0allow to rest for 15 min to ensure optimal\u00a0juiciness level. Then,\u00a0cut and serve with rice and\u00a0enjoy.\u00a0",

Preheat oven to 300\u00baF. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Pat the beef dry and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook in batches in an even layer until very well-browned, about 4-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.\n\n**Cook the Aromatics:**\n\n1. Melt the butter into the pot and add the onions. Cook, stirring regularly, for 4-5 minutes until softened. Add 1 cup of the beef stock and scrape up all the browned bits stuck to bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and stir occasionally for 4-5 minutes until reduced slightly.\n2. Return the beef back to the pot and reduce heat to low. Add the remaining beef stock.\n3.

Remove the garlic from the pot. Once cool enough to handle, pop the cloves from the paper and mash them into a paste. Work the garlic paste back into the broth. Taste and season the broth to your preferences. Add the carrots and cook, covered, for 15-30 minutes on low heat until tender. Remove the cover and cook for 5-10 minutes over medium heat to allow the sauce in the pan to thicken.\n2. If needed, add a splash or two of water. If a thicker gravy is desired, add a flour slurry to the pan and whisk it in and allow it took for an additional 5-10 minutes to thicken.\n\n**To Serve:**\n\n1. Ladle the beef stew over mashed potatoes or your accompaniment of choice. Garnish with parsley, if desired.

Add the flour, black pepper, salt, and paprika to a large bowl and stir to combine.\n2. Blot off any excess liquid from the beef. Add it to the bowl with the flour and toss to coat.\n\n**Brown the beef:**\n\n1. Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the beef in an even layer. Do not overcrowd the pot; you will likely need to brown the beef in batches. Cook for 3\u20135 minutes on each side until browned all over. Transfer to a large bowl and keep the pot on medium-high heat. Add more oil, as needed, while browning the beef.\n\n**Cook the mushrooms:**\n\n1. Add the sliced mushrooms to the pot. Cook, turning occasionally, for 7\u20138 minutes until lightly browned. Continue cooking for an additional 2\u20133 minutes until deep golden brown. Season lightly with salt and transfer to the bowl with the beef.\n\n**Saut\u00e9 the mirepoix:**\n\n1. If the pot is dry, add another drizzle of neutral oil. Turn the heat to medium and add the onion, celery, and carrots. Season all over with salt and pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, for 7\u20138 minutes until the onions are translucent and the carrots begin to brown around the edges.\n2. Melt the butter in the pot and add the garlic and thyme. Toss to coat and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n**Simmer the stew:**\n\n1. Sprinkle the flour over the aromatics and toss to coat. Cook for 1\u20132 minutes until nutty and aromatic. Add \u00bd cup of the water or beef stock and whisk to form a slurry. Continue adding the liquid, in \u00bd-cup increments until all 4 cups of liquid have been incorporated.\u00a0\n2. Return the beef and mushrooms to the pot. Add the remaining 1\u20132 cups liquid if needed to ensure the beef is completely submerged with liquid. Taste and season the broth with more salt and pepper, if needed. *Note: You may need to add more liquid as the beef cooks. You can use additional beef stock or continue adding water if the broth of the stew evaporates too quickly.*\n3. Reduce the heat on the beef stew to low. Cover and simmer and 1\u00bd hours. Check the stew occasionally and add more liquid as needed.\n\n**Finish the stew:**\n\n1. Uncover the stew and simmer for an additional 15\u201320 minutes, uncovered. Taste and season once more to your preferences.\n2. Add the frozen peas and cook for 5 minutes until warmed through and bright green. Turn off the heat.\n\n**Prepare the noodles:**\n\n1. As the stew finishes simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook according to the package",

You can marinate the beef the day before or at least 30 minutes before cooking.\n\n**2.** Fry the meat with onions on high heat to colour and transfer to the slow cooker (you can use a pot or leave it in the same pan as well) add stock to cover the meat and add one tsp of salt. Set the slow cooker on high setting for 3-4 hours (for overnight cooking, keep the beef in larger pieces and set on low setting)\n\n**3.** While the beef is cooking, fry the sweet peppers on medium heat for about 10 minutes, and set them aside for later.\n\n**4.** When the beef is tender, remove it from the slow cooker, and let it cool for a few minutes in the cooking juices. Then, remove it from the liquid, and shred it with your fingers. Mix the shredded beef with the fried sweet peppers, chopped parsley, tomato paste, chipotle paste and some of the meat cooking juices.\n\n**5.** Brush one side of the tortilla with olive oil and place it on a heated frying pan. Add cheese to one side and top with the shredded beef mixture. Once the tortilla is golden-brown, fold it over and flatten slightly.\n\n**6.** Remove the quesadilla from the pan and cut it in half before serving. Enjoy with your favourite Mexican toppings!

Then, keep it warm as you prepare the stir-fry.\n\n**Prepare the marinade:**\n\n* Gather all of the ingredients for the marinade except the cornstarch and beef in a large bowl. Stir until completely combined. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add the cornstarch and stir until smooth. Set aside.\n* Pat the beef dry and cut (with the grain) into 4-inch long pieces to make it easier to slice into strips. Next, cut the resulting beef pieces against the grain into \u00bd-inch wide strips. Cutting against the grain will yield the most tender beef, so be mindful of how you slice!\n* Add the beef to the bowl of marinade and toss to coat. Transfer to the refrigerator for 15\u201330 minutes.\n\n**Cook the vegetables:**\n\n* Heat half the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the onion, snow peas, and red bell pepper. Cook in batches if needed. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the pepper begins to char and the snow peas are bright green and tender, about 5\u20137 minutes. Stir in the ginger and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.\n* Remove the vegetables from the skillet and transfer to a bowl.\n\n**Cook the beef:** \n\n* Add the remaining oil to the skillet over medium-high heat.  Once hot, pour in the beef with all of the marinade. A splatter screen will help with the sputtering! Spread the beef into an even layer. Cook for 3\u20134 minutes until the beef begins to brown and the marinade is bubbling.\n* Crank the heat during the first 3 minutes and watch it closely to develop a sear on the beef without burning the marinade. Then, adjust the heat back to medium-high. It will look like the sauce separates as it cooks, but don\u2019t worry!\n* After 3\u20134 minutes, flip the beef and continue cooking, often turning, for 2\u20134 minutes or until the beef is mostly cooked through.\n* Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and stir to develop a thick sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings. Turn off the heat and stir in the vegetables. Toss to coat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n* Arrange the cooked white rice on a serving platter and pile the stir-fried beef and vegetables on top. Garnish with cilantro, scallions, lime wedges, and crispy shallots. Enjoy!",

When ready, remove the mushrooms and strain the water through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any grit or sand. Transfer the mushroom water to a slow cooker dish, leaving behind the last 50 ml (1\/4 cup) of water that may contain sediment.\n\n**2.** In a frying pan, sear the lardons and sausage over high heat until browned. Transfer the meat to the slow cooker, leaving the fat in the pan.\n\n**3.** In the same pan, brown the diced onions until softened and lightly browned. Transfer them to the slow cooker.\n\n**4.** Next, brown the diced beef in two batches until browned on all sides. Transfer it to the slow cooker.\n\n**5.** Add all the remaining ingredients to the slow cooker, including the hydrated mushrooms, and stir well to combine. Cover with a lid and set the slow cooker to high heat for 5 hours. After the first hour, give it a good stir and repeat every hour or so to distribute the flavours.\n\n**6.** When the Bigos is ready, remove the bay leaves and serve hot with sourdough bread or boiled potatoes. Bigos tastes better with time, so you can store it in the fridge for up to three days, freeze it, or store it in jars if you make a bigger batch. Reheat it gently on the stovetop or in the microwave before serving. Enjoy!",

Add the panko and mix until smooth. Let stand for 10 minutes.\n* Add the garlic powder, crushed red pepper, shallots, and beef. Season all over with salt and pepper. Mix with your hands until well-combined. Fry or microwave a small pinch of the mixture so you can taste and adjust the seasonings as needed.\n* Form the meatballs into tablespoon-sized balls and set aside.\n* Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the meatballs in an even layer, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Cook in batches for 3\u20135 minutes per side until browned all over. It\u2019s ok if they aren\u2019t cooked through! Transfer all of the meatballs to a plate and set aside.\n* Drain off excess fat but leave any browned fond stuck to the bottom as you\u2019ll deglaze it with wine later.\n\n**Cook the sauce:**\n\n* Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot and turn the heat to medium. Once hot, add the yellow onion and cook, stirring often, for 5\u20137 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the tomato paste and mash it into the onion as it cooks. Sizzle the paste for at least 4\u20135 minutes until it deepens in color and begins to stick to the bottom of the pot.\n* Add the red wine and bring to a boil. Stir constantly to lift any of the browned fond from the bottom of the pot.\n* Add the crushed tomatoes and bring to a low boil. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and sugar if needed.\n* Add the cooked meatballs to the sauce along with the basil sprigs. Reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for least 45 minutes until completely cooked through.\n* Serve with pasta, polenta, or as a meatball sub!",

I might get hate for using salsa, but it's a really easy way to load your beef up with flavor with not too much effort. You can use any brand of taquera salsa (which is a taqueria style salsa...)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nStewed Beef\n\n* 2-3 pound chuck roast\n* 1 tablespoon avocado oil\n* 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced into wedges\n* 1\/2 cup beef stock\n* 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes\n* 10 ounce jar salsa taquera\n* Crushed red pepper to taste\n* 1 teaspoon brown sugar, more if you like a sweeter heat\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nCheesy Grits:\n\n* 2 cups water\n* 1 cup corn grits\n* 1 cup whole milk\n* 3 tablespoons butter\n* 1\/2 cup sharp cheddar\n* 1 teaspoon paprika\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\nFor Serving:\n\n* Minced scallions\n* Jalapenos en escabeche (aka pickled jalapenos)\n\n**Method:**\n\n1. Cook the chuck: Preheat oven to 350\u00baF. Pat the chuck dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Cut the steak into thirds.\n2. Heat the avocado oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the chuck and cook the steak pieces for 4-5 minutes per side until browned all over.\n3. Add the onion the skillet around the steak and continue cooking until the onion softens and begins to turn light golden brown, an additional 5-6 minutes.\n4. Pour in the beef stock and bring to a boil. Add the whole peeled tomatoes, salsa taquera, crushed red pepper, salt, pepper, and brown sugar. Bring to a boil and then turn off the heat.\n5. Cover the beef and transfer to the oven for 3 hours.\n6. Remove the pot from the oven and taste. Turn the oven to 275\u00baF.\n7. Season again to taste with salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, and more sugar, if you like. Return to the oven, uncovered, for 1 hour until the beef is completely falling apart. Add more liquid, as necessary, if the beef liquid evaporates too quickly.\n8. Shred the beef and keep warm.\n9. Prepare the cheese grits: Bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Stir in the grits and salt and reduce heat. Stir in the milk. Simmer, stirring often, for 20 minutes until thickened and tender. Stir in the butter, cheddar cheese, paprika, salt, and pepper. Turn off the heat and allow the grits to rest for 5 minutes.\n10. To serve: Divide the cooked grits between plates and pile the beef on top. Garnish with pickled jalape\u00f1os and minced scallions. Enjoy!",

During our stay in the small village of Saint-Martin-de-Bavel, we visited the local restaurant for the dinner and one of the dishes that I tried was Beef Bourguignon over boiled potatoes. I loved the simplicity of the dish and the complexity of the flavour that comes with it. I asked about a few tips of cooking this dish and their secret was to marinate the beef overnight. Back home I tried to recreate this dish and this is the recipe I want to share with you.\n\nThis recipe makes 4 portions\n\nMarinating time: 1 day\n\nCooking time 3,5 hours\n\n**Ingredients for marinade:**\n\n* 500g Diced Beef chuck or other stewing cut\n* half bottle of Burgundy red wine (if not available you can use other red wine too)\n* 1 banana shallot finely diced\n* bunch of fresh thyme, chopped\n* 2 bay leaves\n* 1\/2tsp of black pepper\n\n**Ingredients for stew:**\n\n* 100g of lardons\n* 200g button mushrooms cut in half\n* 15 pearl onions\n* 2 medium carrots cut to half rings\n* half a stick of celery, finely diced\n* 4 garlic cloves\n* 25g of butter\n* 300ml of beef stock\n* extra hot water to be added during cooking (to compensate liquid evaporation)\n* 1tbsp of cornflour dissolved in 2tbsp of water\n* 1tbsp oil\n* Parsley to garnish\n* Boiled potatoes or pasta to serve\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**",

My favourite is Udon, easy to make and tastes fantastic, I bet you will enjoy it as much as I did at the moment when everything mixes together and you take the first bite.\n\nYou don't have to add all of the toppings to make it delicious.

It will pull apart with just my finger tips. \n\nI set the cooker up with a temperature regulator that I\u2019ve programmed to maintain a steady cooking temperature of 225\u00b0f. That makes it so I don\u2019t have to do anything to maintain it while I\u2019m working and meeting a friend for lunch soon. I set it and forget it.\ud83d\udc4d The thermometer in the meat tells me what the internal temperature of the meat is throughout the cook. The clip by the top right of the pan is a thermometer the computer uses to know what the current cooking temperature is during the cook. If it goes below 225\u00b0 the computer turns on a fan to feed the lump coal my Air. The computer will notify me when to meat reaches 200\u00b0f.",

If you like richer potatoes, feel free to add butter or use heavy cream if you like.\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 1 pound pork tenderloin\n* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, plus more\n* 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed and quartered; peel the potatoes if preferred\n* 1 leek, white part only, scrubbed and thinly sliced\n* 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n* \u00bd red cabbage, cored and roughly chopped\n* 1 tablespoon whole grain mustard\n* 1 tablespoon honey\n* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\n* \u00bd cup water\n* \u00bc cup whole milk, plus more if needed\n* 1 teaspoon garlic powder\n* \u00bd teaspoon paprika\n* Pinch of white pepper\n* Pinch of crushed red pepper\n* 2 teaspoons freshly chopped dill, optional\n* Salt and pepper\n\n**Prepare the pork tenderloin:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 425\u00baF.\n2. Pat the pork tenderloin dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n3. Heat 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil in an oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the pork tenderloin and cook for 4\u20135 minutes per side until browned all over. Transfer to a plate.\n\n**Prepare the potatoes:**\n\n1. While the pork fries, place the potatoes in a pot and cover with cold water and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 20\u201325 minutes or until fork tender. Scoop out \u00bc cup of the potato water, drain the potatoes, and return them to the pot. Keep warm.\n\n**Cook the aromatics:**\n\n1. Heat another teaspoon or two of olive oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.\n\n**Saut\u00e9 the cabbage:**\n\n1. Add the chopped cabbage to the leeks and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Cook for 5\u20137 minutes.\n2. Make the sauce: As the cabbage cooks, whisk together the whole grain mustard, honey, Dijon mustard, and water in a bowl until smooth. Roast the pork tenderloin: Pour the sauce into the skillet and bring to a boil. Taste and add salt and pepper if needed.\n3. Place the pork tenderloin on top and transfer to the oven for about 20 minutes or until it reaches 140\u00baF at the thickest part of the tenderloin.\n4. Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the tenderloin to a cutting board to rest for 5 minutes.\n\n**Make the mashed potatoes:**\n\n1. Return the pot of drained potatoes to the stovetop over low heat. Add the reserved potato water and mash with potato masher until mostly smooth. Add the milk, garlic powder, paprika, white pepper, and a big pinch of salt. Mash until the potatoes reach your desired consistency. Taste and season. Set aside and keep warm.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Slice the pork tenderloin into thin medallions. Spoon the mashed potatoes onto opposite sides of a serving platter and pile the cabbage on top. Arrange the sliced tenderloin in the middle and garnish with fresh dill. Enjoy!",

In a bowl, prepare the sauce by whisking together the chicken stock, mustard, and brown sugar.\n2. Fry the pork chops: Preheat oven to 400\u00baF. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add the pork chops and cook without moving for 5 minutes until well browned. Flip and cook an additional 5 minutes until golden brown. Do not overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if needed. Transfer the pork chops to a plate.\n\n**Cook the pears:**\n\n1. Add the pears and shallots to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes per side until the pears are golden brown all over. Season lightly with salt and pepper to taste. Pour the sauce over the pears and toss gently to coat. Turn off the heat and nestle the pork chops into the pears.\n\n**Bake:**\n\n1. Transfer the skillet or braising pot to the oven and bake for about 15 minutes or until an instant-read thermometer reaches 140\u00ba-145\u00baF at the thickest part of the chop. (Note: Cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the chop; begin checking the internal temperature after 10 minutes in the oven)\n2. Rest the pork chops and finish the dish: Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the pork chops to a plate to rest for 5 minutes.\n\n**Cook the Spinach:**\n\n1. Meanwhile, carefully stir the spinach into the pears until wilted. If necessary, put the skillet on low heat on the stove, but the skillet should be warm enough that the spinach wilts with no additional heat. Taste and season to your preference with salt and pepper.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the pears and spinach between plates and place a pork chop on top. Spoon more sauce over the entire dish.

Preheat the oven to 425\u00baF.\n2. Turn the heat on a large pot to medium. Add the mushrooms and cook, occasionally turning as they release water. The water will evaporate over 8\u201310 minutes. Once the water from the mushrooms evaporates, turn the heat to medium-high and add 2 tablespoons of butter. Cook for 4-5 minutes until they brown and crisp up around the edges. Add salt and pepper.\n3. Add the scallion whites to the mushrooms. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the carnaroli rice and cook for 1\u20132 minutes. Add a pinch of salt. *\\*See Note*\n4. Begin ladling in the warm water or stock, 1 cup at a time. Stir after each addition and only add more liquid once the rice absorbs the liquid in the pot. Continue adding the liquid until 5 cups have been incorporated. Taste the risotto to see if the rice is tender. The liquid in the pot should be creamy. Add the remaining 1 cup of water only if needed and stir after adding it. Taste and add salt and pepper. This process will take 20\u201325 minutes.\n5. Once the rice is tender, turn off the heat. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, half of the minced scallion greens, and the Parmesan cheese until melted. Add the lemon juice. Taste and season once more.\n\n**Roast the broccoli:**\n\n1. Arrange the broccoli florets on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.\n2. As soon as you add the carnaroli rice to the pot for the risotto, transfer the broccoli to the oven. Roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover with foil. Keep warm and keep the oven heated to 425\u00baF.\n\n**Cook the pork chops:**\n\n1. Pat the pork chops dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops and cook for 3\u20134 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven for 15\u201317 minutes. Once the pork chops reach 140\u00baF, remove them from the oven and rest on a cutting board for 5\u201310 minutes.\n3. Slice the pork chops thinly and arrange on a serving platter with the roasted broccoli.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the risotto into shallow bowls. Arrange the sliced pork chop on top and serve with the broccoli on the side. Garnish with freshly minced parsley and the remaining minced scallion greens. Enjoy!\n\nNotes:\n\nContinue with roasting the broccoli and the pork chops as you cook the risotto. While you should stir the risotto regularly, you can take breaks periodically to roast the broccoli and fry up the pork chops. It just requires a bit of multitasking!",

Place fennel seeds and caraway seeds in a small skillet, crushing the seeds between your fingers as you sprinkle them in. Add a pinch of flaky sea salt. Turn the heat to medium and toast for 45 seconds. Add the golden beets, mustard, shallot, and Serrano pepper and cook for 3\u20134 minutes, turning occasionally, until they begin to warm through completely.\n2. Pour in the orange juice, vinegar, maple syrup, and 1\/3 cup water. Season with salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low and simmer for 30\u201345 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the relish becomes jammy and sticky. Add more water as needed to loosen up the relish as needed. Taste and season once more.\n\n**Cook the bacon:**\n\n1. Place the diced bacon in a wide pot over medium heat. Cook, turning often until the fat completely renders from the bacon and the bacon crisps up. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Pour all but 1 tablespoon of rendered bacon fat into a heat-proof glass.\n\n**Brown the pork chops:**\n\n1. Pat the pork chops dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Add 1 tablespoon neutral oil to the 1 tablespoon bacon fat in the pot. Add the pork chops and cook without moving for 3\u20135 minutes per side until browned. Brown the fat caps for 1\u20132 minutes and then transfer the pork chops to a baking sheet. Transfer to the oven for 15\u201320 minutes or until the pork chops reach desired internal temperature, 135\u00baF\u2013140\u00baF is ideal for medium-rare as the chop will rest up to 145\u00baF.\n3. Remove the pork chops from the oven and tent them with foil.\n\n**Prepare the cabbage:**\n\n1. Drain and discard the oil in the pot. Heat up 2 tablespoons of the reserved bacon fat. Once hot, add the diced cabbage and season all over with salt and pepper to taste. Add the sugar, orange juice, distilled white vinegar, and mustard. Pour in the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is tender, 15\u201320 minutes. Stir all but a pinch of the cooked bacon into the cabbage. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Divide the braised cabbage between plates and place a pork chop on top. Spoon the golden beet relish on top of each chop. Sprinkle the rest of the crispy bacon on top of each dish. Serve alongside roasted potatoes if you like. Enjoy!",

        "ingredient_comment":"Certainly not the quickest recipe, and to be honest not as good as you can get buying from people that make them for a living, but as a British expat this is as close as I can get.\n\nRecipe lightly modified from here: [https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/food\/recipes\/scotcheggs\\_85851](https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/food\/recipes\/scotcheggs_85851)\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\nFor the sausage meat:\n\n\\- 1lb lean minced pork\n\n\\- 20g Stuffing Mix (Bland as possible so American style preferably. I used Stove Top pork)- Freshly ground Pepper\n\n\\- 2 tsp fresh thyme\n\n\\- 1 tsp parsley flakes\n\n\\- 1 tsp sage\n\n\\- 2 small shallots, very finely chopped\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the scotch eggs:\n\n\\- 6 medium eggs\n\n\\- 80g plain flower, seasoned with salt and pepper\n\n\\- 1 egg beaten\n\n\\- 3 slices of white bread, lightly toasted then ground into breadcrumbs\n\n\\- vegetable oil, for frying\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Method**\n\n\\- Combine all the ingredients for the sausage meat together in a medium bowl, mix thoroughly. Meat can be covered and stored in fridge for later use.\n\n\\- Place the eggs, unbroken, in cold salted water. Bring to the boil then immediately reduce tempreature and simmer for 9 min. (You may have to do this in stages, if so you only need to let the water cool to warm between batches)\n\n\\- When the eggs are finished strain and cool under running water. Then peel off the shells, if you haven't done this before I recommend looking up a video, fingernails help.\n\n\\- Take the sausage meet and divide into sixths on a clean cutting board, before flattening each into a shallow oval \\~1\/4\" thick.\n\n\\- Spread the seasoned flower onto a large plate. One at a time take a peeled egg and dredge it in flower until a thin coating sticks to all surfaces, before placing the egg at the center of the flattened sausage meat, and wrapping the meat around it and gently rolling to form a smooth egg shaped ball.\n\n\\- Prepare the breadcrumbs, I used a stick blender and a tall cup to get them fine enough. Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate. One at a time coat the meat wrapped eggs in the beaten egg mixture before rolling in bread crumbs enough to ensure a even coating on all surfaces.\n\n\\- With all the eggs prepared select a high walled pot and fill with oil, quantity will vary based on pot selection but ideally should be enough to completely submerge the prepared egg. **Important:** Do not fill the pot anywhere near to full, remember when you place eggs in the oil level will rise and we do not want it to boil over. Heat the oil until a loose breadcrumb placed in it will bubble and brown in around 30s. (I found this was around 370F)\n\n\\- The eggs will be cooked for \\~9 min in the hot oil. I suggest using a slotted spoon to place and remove them. I encourage you to monitor the oil tempreature yourself, either by thermometer or look and feel and suggest you open up the first egg cooked and determine if any adjustments need to be made. It will all be relative to your setup but I cooked the eggs two at a time on alternating cycles, one egg removed every four and a half minutes, my oil temperature remained fairly constant at \\~320F, and I rotated the eggs twice to ensure even cooking.\n\n\\- **Important:** Usual safety precautions when working with hot oil apply, always use long implements to place eggs into the oil preferably from the side of the pot. Be aware of the temperament of the oil, sizzling is good bubbling is worrying. Be aware of the level of the oil as you add and remove the eggs. Finally as I was working in a small pot I took the step of turning off the gas every time I added a egg to prevent risk of flare up if the oil overflowed.\n\n\\- When the eggs are finished place them on a sheet of kitchen roll to absorb excess oil. Personal preference is to serve chilled or at room temperature, though they can be eaten warm after allowing some time to cool.  \n\n\n  \n**Improvements**  \nThis is probably the simplest least creative recipe for scotch eggs out there, I was deliberately aiming for generic. It does however make it completely open to adaptation\/improvement. If I were to make it again I would definitely attempt to address the slightly bland breadcrumbs, I suspect the answer may be more salt but I also want to see if some herbs (perhaps sage) add some complexity to the flavor.",

So you'll find a range of flavor strengths that cater to how much else you may be eating with it!\n\nOther versions (i believe northern taiwan is more towards this) use just minced pork and may add in pork fat\/skin portions to their own tastes, and these versions also taste absolutely delicious - dont feel worried if you cant find pork belly.\n\nPersonally, i love it served with any pickle! traditional pickled mustard greens, soy pickled cucumbers, kimchi, viet sweet pickled radishes and carrots, pickled red onions - i dont actually love pickles, but with a dish as luxurious and rich as this, i think it elevates to a new level.\n\nTea eggs are also a classic, but i sometimes just love an over-easy egg cracked on top of it.\n\nThank you OP for reminding me of this gem of a dish, im going to make it again next week. This week i made a somewhat similar chicken dish version of this called \" Ji Rou Fan.\"\n\nEdit: Oh my gosh how could i forget, this sauce is SO versatile. It doesnt just transform rice into something else, it goes so nicely on top of clear broth noodles or noodle soups in general. It really is a dish so very close to the hearts of many of the Taiwanese. My closest comparison i could think of to this would be a wonderfully deep and rich beef ragu or bolognese sauce.",

        "ingredient_comment":"Cochinita Tacos are one of the most popular foods in the Mexican region of Yucatan. Pork meat is prepared by marinating in a unique spice blend called Red Recado and slow-cooked in fruit juices over a period of 21 hours. The meat is then mixed with the cooking juices, served on a corn tortilla with red onion pickle. Taco is garnished with cilantro or parsley. Sometimes salsa or guacamole is also served as a topping but it is a personal preference.\n\nAt home, I used a slow-cooker on a low setting. 8 pm start for the overnight cook, meat was ready lunchtime on the following day. The only side effect of this method of cooking is sleepless night as the delicious aromas keep you awake...\n\n## What kind of meat is used for Cochinita Pibil Tacos?\n\nTraditionally, hairless Mexican pig is used for Cochinitas. For the top-quality meat, pigs are raised in an organic setting, fed with a variety of fruit, grass, grains and vegetables. Papaya is their most beloved feed on the menu giving the pork a unique flavour. Almost all parts of the animal are used for recipe ranging from ears, cheeks, main body to offal.\n\nTo prepare Cochinitas at home I choose Pork shoulder as my preference. Next time I will definitely try ribs or belly.\n\nRemember to choose the best quality meat from sources that respect animal life and consumers health!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n## What is a Red Recado Spice blend?\n\nThe main ingredient of Red Recado is an Annatto that comes from the Achiote tree native to the tropical region of Mexico and Brazil. Their aroma is very unique reminding Roses with a hint of nutmeg and pepper. The whole Annatto seeds can be purchased online and ground at home.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**Ingredients for Red Recado:**\n\n* 3tbsp of ground Annatto seeds\n* 1tsp of allspice\n* 1tsp of cloves\n* 1tsp black peppercorns\n* 0,5tsp cinnamon\n* 1tsp cumin\n* 1tbsp oregano\n* 2tsp of salt\n* 6 garlic cloves\n* hot chilli peppers (traditionally tabasco are used, I used 4 birds eye chillis from my home garden)\n\n**Ingredients for slow-cooked meat:**\n\n* 1,5kg (3.3 Pounds) pork shoulder cut into 4 (ribs, belly plus any other part that you like can be used as well)\n* 500ml of fruit juice (2 grapefruits, 3limes, 4 oranges) use 100ml for the pickled onion\n* 1L of vegetable stock\n\n**",

I did a little hunting and found a version on Cookpad by Kanya from Thailand which uses LOTS of cilantro. Kanya's version uses tofu, which I didn\u2019t have, so I omitted that.\n\nObviously, both versions are probably equally tasty, but I was definitely intrigued by the white pepper in the pork from Kanya's recipe, so that's what I used as my starting point.\n\nThis is a really easy recipe and a unique take on a really cheap veggie that most of us are probably swimming in this time of year!\n\n# SUBSTITUTIONS:\n\nGround Pork: Ground chicken or ground turkey\n\nCucumber: Seedless or seeded, doesn't matter\n\nGround White Pepper: Use black pepper instead \u2013 it won't have exactly the same flavor, but it's ok.\n\nYou can follow Kanya's method and add tofu to it, as well!\n\n# RECIPE\n\n## Equipment\n\n* Large pot\n\n## Ingredients\n\n## Pork Mixture\n\n* 1 pound ground pork\n* 6 cloves garlic peeled and minced\n* 3 tablespoons soy sauce\n* \u00bd tablespoon sesame oil\n* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste\n* 1 teaspoon ground white pepper\n* \u00bc cup fresh cilantro leaves and stems minced (see note)\n\n## Cucumber Soup:\n\n* 2 large cucumbers\n* 6 cups water or low-sodium chicken stock\n* 3 tablespoons soy sauce\n* \u00bd tablespoon sesame oil\n* 1 bunch cilantro stems minced (see note)\n* 1 teaspoon black pepper\n* 1-2 teaspoons sriracha, chili oil, sambal oolek or crushed red pepper to taste\n* 1 scallion minced; white and green parts separated\n* Salt, to taste\n* Sesame seeds optional, for garnish\n\n##",

Heat oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the shallot and chili pepper and cook for 1 minute.\n\n**Saut\u00e9 the vegetables:**\n\n1. Add the mushrooms, carrots, and potatoes and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a pinch of salt.\n\n**Crack the coconut:**\n\n1. Scoop out the solid fat from the coconut milk and add it to the pot. Cook until it begins to separate and any water from the coconut evaporates. This will take about 7-12 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the potatoes from sticking.\n2. Once it separates, add the curry paste. Stir to mix the paste into the coconut and cook for 3-4 minutes. Pour in the rest of the liquid from the can of coconut and stir to lift up anything stuck to the bottom.\n\n**Simmer the curry:**\n\n1. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer the curry for 15\u201320 minutes until the potatoes are fork-tender. Add a few splashes of water as needed if it sticks. While the curry simmers, prepare a pot of rice or noodles.\n\n**Finish the curry:**\n\n1. Taste and adjust seasonings.\n2. Add the shrimp, bok choy, and bell pepper and cook for 5-8 minutes until shrimp is opaque. Taste and season one final time. Turn off the heat.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Serve with cooked rice, cilantro, crispy shallots, and lime wedges. Enjoy!",

Combine the minced cilantro, scallions, chili pepper, red onion, lime juice, and zest in a large bowl. Sprinkle lightly with salt and set aside.\n\n**Make the roasted potatoes:**\n\n1. Preheat oven to 425\u00baF.\n2. Arrange the potatoes on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil. Sprinkle the garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne powder if using. Mix to coat well and arrange in an even layer. Transfer to the oven for 15 minutes.\n3. After 15 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and add the red bell pepper and red onion to the baking sheet. Drizzle with a teaspoon of neutral oil and sprinkle salt on top of the pepper and onion before mixing gently into the potatoes. Arrange in an even layer and return to the oven for 20\u201325 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the baking sheet in the warm oven as you finish the rest of the recipe.\n\n**Cook the fish:**\n\n1. Add 1 tablespoon neutral oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pat the tilapia dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Add the Wondra to a large bowl. Dip each tilapia filet in the Wondra and coat the fish evenly. Shake off any excess flour.\n3. Transfer the fish to the hot skillet and cook in an even layer. Cook in batches if needed so as not to crowd the skillet. Fry until golden brown and crisp, about 3\u20135 minutes per side. As the filets reach 145\u00baF, transfer them to the bowl of minced herbs.\n4. Once all the fish finishes cooking, use two forks to flake into the minced herbs and lime juice. Taste and adjust the seasonings.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Pile the fish salpic\u00f3n on top of tostada shells or charred tortillas and garnish with scallion greens, sliced cucumber, radishes, and guacamole or diced avocado if you like. Serve with the roasted potatoes on the side. Enjoy!\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nCalories: 346kcal | Carbohydrates: 40g | Protein: 30g | Fat: 8g | Sodium: 167mg | Fiber: 5g | Sugar: 4g | Vitamin C: 20mg",

Before beginning, prepare the leek as it takes the most time. Halve the leek lengthwise and very thinly slice both halves into 1\/8-inch wide slivers. You may need to separate some of the layers of the leek and slice each layer separately. If you find bits of dirt deep within the leek, don\u2019t fret. You can place all the leek slivers in a sieve and rinse again once more to remove any stubborn flecks of dirt.\n2. Transfer the sliced leek to a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry to remove any excess water.\n\n**Steep the saffron:**\n\n1. Place the crushed saffron in a small bowl and cover it with 2 tablespoons of hot water. Set aside.\n\n**Prepare the guanciale chili oil:**\n\n1. Place the guanciale in a large pot (you\u2019ll use this pot later for the orzo and cod!) and turn the heat to medium. Cook, turning occasionally, for 8\u201310 minutes until the fat renders and the guanciale becomes crispy.\n2. Add the shallot, garlic, and crushed red pepper and cook for an additional 3 minutes, turning often and adjusting the heat as needed to prevent the garlic from browning. Once the shallot softens, and the garlic takes on a very light golden color, spoon the mixture into a bowl. Scoop out all but a tablespoon of the fat from the pot and add it to the bowl of guanciale.\n3. Pour the extra virgin olive oil, chili oil, and maple syrup over the guanciale. Stir vigorously to combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings to your preference. Add more maple syrup, chili oil, or crushed red pepper, depending on your preferences.\n4. The guanciale oil will keep in an airtight jar for up to 5 days.\n\n**Prepare the saffron cod and orzo:**\n\n1. Pat the cod dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\n2. Return the pot of remaining guanciale fat to medium heat. Add the sliced fennel bulb and stalks along with the sliced shallot. Season with salt and cook for 5\u20136 minutes until the fennel begins to soften.\n3. Add the garlic and cook for 1\u20132 minutes until just fragrant.\n4. Melt the butter into the pot and add the orzo. Stir to coat and cook for 1\u20132 minutes until it begins to lightly toast. Season with salt.\n5. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil for 2\u20133 minutes. Stir often to lift up any orzo that may have stuck to the bottom.\n6. Reduce heat to low and arrange the cod on top. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil. Drizzle the steeped saffron mixture all over, ensuring that each piece of cod gets a little bit of saffron water.\n7. Cover and simmer over low heat for 12\u201315 minutes or until the cod is opaque and the orzo is tender.\n\n**Frizzle the leek:**\n\n1. *Note: Use a saucepan that has somewhat high sides. Generally, you want a saucepan that\u2019s at least 6\u20138 inches deep. When you add the leeks to the hot oil, the oil will foam up vigorously, and you do NOT want it pouring over the edges.*\n2. As the cod simmers, make the leeks. In a saucepan, pour in 2 inches of vegetable oil. Turn the heat to medium-high. Break off a piece of leek and add it to the pot; if it bubbles rapidly, it\u2019s ready to fry.\n3. Working in small batches, add a handful of the leeks at a time to the oil. Stir occasionally and fry for 15\u201320 seconds until golden brown. Remove and\u2013using tongs\u2013transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Continue on until all the leeks are fried. Pat any excess oil off from the tops of the leeks with a paper towel and season with flaky sea salt. Set aside.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Spoon the cooked orzo into shallow bowls and place a piece of cod on top. Arrange the frizzled leeks next to the cod and drizzle with the guanciale chili oil. Sprinkle a few bits of fennel fronds on top if you remember (unlike me\u2026). Enjoy!",

Place the cabbage, red onion, serrano pepper, and cilantro in a large bowl. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pour the lime juice on top.\n2. In a microwave-safe bowl, add the vinegar and sugar. Microwave for 1 minute until the sugar is dissolved. Let stand for 5\u201310 minutes.\n3. Add the mayonnaise and whisk until completely smooth.\n4. Pour the dressing over the cabbage and toss to combine. Taste and season to your preferences. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.\n\n**Prepare the jalape\u00f1o-avocado cream cheese:**\n\n1. Turn on your oven\u2019s broiler to high.\n2. Place the red onion and jalape\u00f1os in a small oven-proof skillet or baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil. Transfer to the oven under the broiler. Broil for 3\u20135 minutes (depending on the intensity of your broiler) until the peppers begin to blister and blacken. Remove and set aside.\n3. Combine the avocado, cilantro, lime juice, charred jalape\u00f1o, and red onion in a food processor. Place the cream cheese on top and pulse until completely smooth and creamy. Taste and season with salt. Pour into an airtight jar or a bowl and cover tightly with foil. Transfer to the refrigerator until needed.\n\n**Make the cod:**\n\n1. Pour oil into a large pot, about 3 inches deep, and heat the oil to 350\u00ba\u2013375\u00baF. Note: If you don\u2019t have a deep fat thermometer, use an instant-read meat thermometer, provided the stem is long enough! You\u2019ll want to regularly check the oil\u2019s temperature and ensure you stay at a consistent 350\u00baF\u2013375\u00baF.\n2. Pat the cod pieces dry and season lightly with salt. Set aside.\n3. Combine the flour, chili powder, salt, baking powder, paprika, cayenne powder, and garlic powder in a bowl.\n4. Pour in the beer and whisk until completely smooth and free of lumps. The batter will be thicker than cream but still a tad runny.\n5. Place all of the cod pieces in the batter and toss to combine.\n6. Using tongs, lift a piece of cod from the batter and lightly shake off any drippy excess batter. Slowly drop it into the hot oil. Fry 4\u20136 pieces at a time, depending on the width of your pot. Be sure not to overcrowd the pot! Cook for 3\u20134 minutes until golden brown all over. Use a slotted spoon to transfer a paper towel-lined plate. Continue frying in batches, checking and adjusting the temperature periodically.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1. Arrange radishes, cucumber, red onion, cilantro, sliced jalape\u00f1o, and lime wedges on a serving platter.\n2. To assemble the tacos, smear a spoonful of the jalape\u00f1o-avocado cream cheese onto a warm tortilla. Place a few cod nuggets on top and finish with a spoonful of slaw. Sprinkle minced red onion and cilantro on top. Add one or two slices of jalape\u00f1o on top for extra heat, if you like. Serve cucumber, lime wedges, and radishes on the side. Enjoy!\n\n**Notes:**\n\nFor the recipe, you\u2019ll use cilantro in the slaw, cream cheese, and for serving. Buy just 1 nice-sized bunch and divide it into 3 for each component.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to buy just 1 red onion (use half of it for the slaw, and the remaining half is used for the cream cheese and for serving).\n\n**Nutrition:**\n\nCalories: 304kcal | Carbohydrates: 34g | Protein: 16g | Fat: 12g | Sodium: 351mg | Fiber: 4g | Sugar: 5g | Vitamin C: 17mg",

If you would rather make this as a poke bowl, skip the sushi rice section and just use plain white rice. You can easily customize these with whatever extra toppings you like.\n\n**Original Recipe**: [https:\/\/craftycookbook.com\/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls\/](https:\/\/craftycookbook.com\/sesame-salmon-sushi-bowls\/)\n\n**Time:** 50 mins\n\n**Servings:** 2 XL bowls (as pictured) or 3-4 smaller servings\n\n**Ingredients**\n\n*For Sushi Rice:*\n\n* 1 1\/2 cups medium grain sushi rice\n* 1 3\/4 cups warm water\n* 6 tbsp unseasoned rice vinegar *(This should have no calories. If it has calories, the vinegar is already seasoned with sugar and salt.)*\n* 2 tbsp white sugar\n* 1 1\/2 tsp table salt\n\n*For Sesame Salmon:*\n\n* 6-10 oz sushi quality salmon (pictured is 5 oz per bowl)\\*\\*\n* 2 green onions\n* 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil\n* 1 tbsp soy sauce\n* 1 tsp toasted white sesame seeds\n\n*To Finish Bowls:*\n\n* 1\/2 medium-sized ripe avocado, optional\n* \\~1\/2 cup shelled, frozen edamame, optional\n* \\~1\/4 cup thinly sliced red onion, optional\n* \\~1\/4 cup daikon sprouts, optional\n* other veggies such as carrots, cucumber, nori, bean sprouts, etc optional\n\n\\*\\*I purchase fish marked for sushi\/sashimi from a Japanese grocery store, but this isn't the only option available.\n\n**To Prepare Sushi Rice:**\n\n1. The rice takes about 50 minutes to prepare, but has a lot of hands-off time. The salmon and veggies for this meal can be prepared as the rice cooks. Optionally, you can substitute plain white rice to make this recipe as a poke bowl instead.\n2. Place the rice in a large pot (that has a lid). Rinse and drain the rice until the water runs clear, at least 3 times (rinse the rice even if the bag says it's \"prewashed\"). Drain as much water as possible.\n3. Add 1 3\/4 cup lukewarm water to the pot, close with the lid, and place on the stove top.\n4. Heat over medium-high heat until the water begins to boil, once boiling cook over medium-high heat for 4 minutes, then reduce heat to very-low and simmer for 15 minutes.\n5. After simmering, remove from heat and let the pot stand undisturbed for another 15 minutes.\n6. Scoop the rice into a large non-metallic bowl. Dust with sugar and salt, then pour over the rice vinegar. Using a rice spatula or non-stick spatula mix everything together and break up all the clumps of rice. Mix until every grain of rice is separated and coated in vinegar, the sugar and salt should dissolve completely. Don't worry if the rice seems too wet at this point, that will go away as it cools.\n7. Allow the rice to cool uncovered, mixing occasionally, until it reaches room temp (about 15 minutes).

Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the gnocchi and cook until they float to the top.

Continue stirring until completely smooth. Once the liquid begins to bubble, stir in the cream and parmesan. Taste and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes if you like. Simmer for 5 minutes.\n\n**Finish the shrimp and gnocchi:**\n\n1. Stir in the lemon juice and zest and the fresh parsley. Add the shrimp and gnocchi and let bubble in the sauce for 5 minutes just to warm the gnocchi and shrimp. Taste and season once more.\n\n**To serve:**\n\n1.

Finely chop the scallions, garlic and ginger. Add half the sunflower oil to a pot on a medium heat. When it has come up to temperature add the scallions and cook for about three minutes. The oil will bubble as the water cooks out of them. Make sure they do not brown. Add the ginger, star anise and cinnamon and cook for another two minutes, stirring every so often, before adding the garlic and continuing to cook.\n\n2.) In a bowl combine the gochugaru, sugar, black sesame seeds and chilli flakes. one tbsp. of chilli will give you a milder r\u0101yu. If you like more of a kick you can add an extra spoonful. Add the mixture in the the pot and top off with the remainder of the oil. Stir well, and cook over a low to medium heat on a gentle and constant simmer for 12 - 15 minutes, taking care not to allow anything to burn or brown too much.\n\n3.) Add the tamari and the rice wine vinegar and stir. Turn the heat off and allow to cook before placing in a sterilised jar. This should keep in the fridge for a few weeks.\n\n4.) Remove scallops from the fridge to come to room temperature. Add oil and butter to a pan on a high heat. Pat them dry and season with coarse salt and pepper before placing in the pan flat side down. Push them down slightly and cook for about two minutes until a deep golden colour. Turn and cook or another minute or two. Baste with the butter. They should be springy to the touch and just warm in the centre when tested with a metal skewer.\n\n5.) Add a tbsp. of the chilli oil to a plate and arrange three scallops around it. Spoon some of the chunkier pieces of the r\u0101yu over the top and season. A squeeze of lemon juice and some grated zest elevates the dish.",

Pour enough water to completely cover the cheese, and soak it for 20 minutes to reduce the saltiness and change the texture of the cheese. When it's ready, remove it from the water and mix it with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, paprika, and turmeric.\n\n**2.** For the sauce, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium-sized pot over medium heat. Add cumin, coriander, and caraway seeds and cook until fragrant, then add sliced garlic and diced onion. Cook until the onions are softened, then add paprika and harissa paste. Cook for another minute and add chopped tomatoes, honey, salt, and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. If the sauce seems too thick, add water. Cook for 10 minutes.\n\n**3.** In the meantime, preheat the oven to 220\u00b0C fan and prepare the vegetables for roasting. Place the diced aubergine in a bowl and marinate it with balsamic vinegar, olive oil, honey, salt, and Ras el Hanout spice blend. Mix well, then add peppers and onions and mix again. The aubergine's spongy texture will soak up all the flavours. Place the vegetables on a tray and roast in the oven for around 20 minutes (Don't overcrowd the vegetables on the roasting tray. Spread them out in a single layer so that they cook evenly and roast to perfection, use two trays if necessary).\n\n**4.** When the sauce is ready, you can blend it or leave it as is. Transfer it to a cast iron pan or other baking dish, add the roasted vegetables to the sauce, and top with the halloumi cheese. Place it in the oven and change the setting to the 220\u00b0C grill. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until the halloumi cheese starts to brown (Be careful not to overcook the Halloumi cheese. It only needs a few minutes under the grill to brown and become crispy. Keep an eye on it and remove it from the oven as soon as it reaches your desired level of doneness).\n\n**5.** Remove from the oven, garnish with parsley or cilantro, and enjoy with your favourite flatbread!

You could easily add garlic, roasted poblano peppers, or extra plant or meat protein to the soup.\n\nFor extra plant protein, I would add white beans or tofu crumbles or top with fried tofu chorizo crumbles.\n\nIf you want to do meat, I would do something light like shrimp or chicken.\n\nYou can also get creative with toppings like what I suggested below or add some crispy tortillas, crushed crackers, finely chopped tomatoes, or minced red onion.\n\n* 1 tablespoon neutral oil\n* 1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and diced\n* 1 cup quinoa, rinsed\n* 5\u20136 cups of water or vegetable stock\n* 2 ears of sweet corn, husked and cut from the cob\n* 1 cup loosely packed cilantro, minced\n* 6 ounces plant-based cream or coconut milk\n* Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**For serving:**\n\n* Sliced jalape\u00f1o\n* Lime\n* Cilantro\n\n**Method:**\n\nHeat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a wide pot over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and season liberally with salt and pepper. Cook in the oil for 6\u20137 minutes, turning occasionally, until they just begin to soften.\n\nAdd the quinoa to the potatoes and cook for 1 minute.\n\nPour in 5 cups of water or vegetable stock and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Once boiling, reduce heat to a hard simmer and cook for 20 minutes or until the quinoa is tender. If the soup is too thick, add the remaining 1 cup water or stock.\n\nAdd the corn, cilantro, and cream to the soup and simmer for an additional 5\u20136 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\nLadle the chowder into bowls. Garnish with jalape\u00f1o slices, a lime wedge, and a few more cilantro leaves if you like. Enjoy!",

Prepare your veggies: finely dice the onion and chilli. Mince the garlic. Cut the apple and potatoes into cubes, 2 by 2 cm should be ideal. I actually like to peel the potatoes but leave the skin on the apples.\n\n2. Begin by heating the butter in a pot over medium heat. Once it\u2019s melted, add the onion and immediately salt it so it releases some moisture. Sweat for 4 minutes, then add your chilli and garlic. Cook for 2 minutes, then add the curry powder and cook for another 2 minutes.\n\n3. Add the apples and broth. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. \n\n4. Remove half of what\u2019s in the pot, blend it and return to the pot.\n\n5. Add the potatoes, chickpeas, and cream, then cook for 15 minutes or until the potatoes are soft.\n\n6. Let it cool down a bit, then add chopped mint. Add salt and pepper to taste if needed.\n\n7. Serve over some basmati rice with additional lime wedges and some more mint. \n\n\nPreparation video: https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/VWBgm6AV0jQ?feature=share",

They have slimy caps and are perfect for sauces, soups or pickles. As the name suggests Larch Bolete can be found growing in symbiosis with Larch trees starting in July till November.\r  \n\r  \nThis is my family recipe for a delicious and filling mushroom soup, perfect after a fungi hunt. It contains pasta and a variety of vegetables that elevate the mushroom flavour. The recipe works with Boletus mushrooms but if not available you can prepare them with chestnut mushrooms instead.\r  \n\r  \nIn Poland, mushroom picking is very popular among families and the knowledge is passed from generation to generation. Make sure to always pick mushrooms with someone who knows what they doing, or pick specimens that are hard to confuse, I always recommend signing up for a foraging experience!

Just grab one floret and dip it in the sauce :)\n\n### What is Tikka Masala sauce and where it comes from?\n\nThe history of this popular sauce is not 100% clear, some say it was created in India while others say it was created in the UK by Bangladeshi migrant Chefs. Whoever did it, did a good job, the sauce is one of the most popular in the world thanks to its mild and delicate flavour. In short, it is the smooth tomato-based curry sauce with the addition of **garam masala** and finished with yoghurt. The sauce is usually served with dry roasted marinated chicken or lamb (Tikka). From my experience, every Chef prepares it differently, what are your experiences with this sauce?\n\n### Ingredients for Tikka Masala sauce:\n\n* 1tbsp butter\n* 1 banana shallot, finely diced\n* 2 garlic cloves, minced\n* 1tsp of fresh ginger, minced\n* 1\/2tsp turmeric\n* 1\/2tsp ground coriander\n* 1\/2tsp **garam masala** \n* 1\/2tsp mild chilli powder (add less if using standard chilli powder)\n* 400g (0.9Pounds) of chopped tomato sauce (one tin)\n* 2tsp sugar\n* 1\/2tsp salt\n* 2,5tbsp yoghurt\n* fresh coriander to garnish\n\n### Ingredients for Crunchy Cauliflower:\n\n* medium-sized cauliflower (around 750g with leaves removed) cut into florets (cut biggest florets into half).\n* 1\/2tsp salt\n* 1\/2tsp paprika\n* 1\/2tsp turmeric\n* 1\/2tsp black pepper\n* 2 eggs\n* 100g (3.5oz) breadcrumbs\n* 0,5L (0.5quarts) vegetable oil for deep-frying (may need more if using deep-fryer) \n\n###",

Simply place your beetroots in a baking tray, cover with aluminum foil and place inside a pre heated oven on 180\\*C.\n\n2)Bake the beetroots until fork tender (piercing a fork inside without applying any pressure). Time may vary from 45 minutes to 2 hours.\n\n3)Once fork tender, peel the skin off, dice the beets roughly and blend with a stix mixer.  \nyour beatiful beetroot puree is now ready to use!\n\nFor the garnish:\n\n1)Place your cheese, olive oil and salt into a shallow mixing bowl and blend well with a stix mixer.\n\n2)Pass the creamy mixture through a fine sieve to assure a more stable texture.\n\n3)Mix well with the orange zest and set aside for further use.\n\nFor the risotto:\n\n1)Start by preparing the rice. Take a skillet or shallow pot and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your rice.\n\n2)Stir constantly for about 2-3 minutes until the edges of the grain start becoming translucent.\n\n3)Now that we build a protective layer around the grain, pour in your water and stir frequently until all the water has evaporated.\n\n4)Transfer the rice onto a tin, and let cool.\n\n5)Once cool, your rice is ready to use. This is a neat little step worth making when cooking risotto as it helps release more of that starchy goodness later on when cooking the risotto. Par-cooked rice like this can last up to a week in a food container in your fridge and will greatly shorten your time preparing risotto.\n\n6)Now take your skillet and place on medium-high heat. Drizzle over a tablespoon of olive oil and toss in your diced onions.\n\n7)Saute the onions until soft and translucent. It will probably take in between 7-10 minutes.\n\n8)Once your onions are beautifully tender, add in your finely minced garlic and stir for another minute.\n\n9)Now add in your rice and season with salt and pepper. (This is the perfect time to add salt as it will drain any extra juices which will be absorbed by the rice.)\n\n10)Stir constantly for another minute or two and proceed to pour in your wine.\n\n11)Keep stirring (from this moment on, you\u2019ll have to be stirring most of the time as more motion the rice makes, the more starch it releases, creating a creamy texture.) until all the wine has evaporated.\n\n12)Now that your wine has evaporated, add 3 tablespoons of your beetroot pure and stir until incorporated.  \n\n\n13)Now start adding your vegetable stock (hot! so it doesn\u2019t prevent the rice from continuing to cook.) a little at a time as the rice absorbs the liquid. The reason you don\u2019t pour it all at the same time is because you don\u2019t know how much liquid the rice will absorb.  \n\n\n14)When the rice is cooked al-dente\u00a0 it should still have a slightly \u201crunny to watery\u201d texture, we don\u2019t want it thick.\n\n15)Now turn off the heat and add the butter, preferably room temperature so it blends more quickly\n\n16)Once you add the butter, now is the time to really work your hand, and give the rice a good beating, stirring it vigorously until all the butter has blended with the dish.  \n\n\n17)After the butter has blended add the parmesan cheese and beat again, this time not as vigorously until the cheese has melted.",

It\u2019s fantastic on a very warm day. \n\n**Ingredients** (can be amended to suit your tastes)\n\n* One cucumber. Roughly peel the cucumber so you get that lovely variation in green colour. Score lengthways with a fork. Slice lengthways once through the middle and then chop thinly. \nRealistically you can cut them up however you like but a thin slice is best imo.\n\n* Half a small pineapple, chopped. \n\n* Half a red onion (or one shallot), sliced as thinly as possible. \n\n* One red chilli, thinly sliced.

As always if you want to see the video recipe [HERE](https:\/\/youtu.be\/3P4eV9RZ5sg) and if you like the recipe and want to join the yt channel i will be grateful \\^\\_\\^\n\nHow to Vegetarian Pumpkin Meatballs :\n\nIngredients\n\n* 500 gr pumpkin\n* 100 gr parmigiano\n* 100 gr breadcrumbs\n* 1 egg\n* 60 gr assorted cheese\n* 3 sage leaf\n* salt &amp; Black pepper\n\n**INSTRUCTION**\n\n* Cut the mozzarella in slices of 1 cm thickness. Arrange them gradually on a tray lined with absorbent paper and cover with other sheets of paper towels.\n* Cut 500 gr pumpkin in slices, remove the peel and put on a oven tray\n* Season with olive oil and salt\n* cook for 30 minutes at 140\u00b0\n* mash the cooked pumpkin in a mixing bowl with a fork\n* Add 100 gr parmigiano and 100 gr breadcrumbs\n* add 1 egg, salt, pepper and 3 sage leaf finely cut\n* make a ball with the dough and put in the fridge for 30 minutes\n* Cut the mozzarella and the other cheese in small dices. This time i made these pumpkin meatball in three variations, mozzarella, cheddar or fontina cheese. For all the meatballs you will need a total of 60 gr of cheese\n* take the dough in the fridge and form balls of about 40 gr inserting in the center some cubes of the chosen cheese.\n* Close the meatball as to seal the cheese inside and work with your hands to give it a round shape.\n* Don't make the meatball too big or the cheese inside will not melt from these doses you should get about 15 meatballs\n* put every meatball in the breadcrumbs\n* At this point, bring frying oil to a temperature of 140\u00b0 and immerse the meatballs in oil for a couple of minutes, so that the cheese inside melts\n* When they are golden brown, drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil\n\nThat's all! Like i said this recipe is very easy and remember : Eat while it's still hot!\n\nIf you have any question feel free to ask \\^\\_\\^",
